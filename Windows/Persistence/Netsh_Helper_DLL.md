# Netsh Helper DLL

## MITRE ATT&CK Technique:
[T1128](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1128)

## A DLL can be registered to be loaded each time netsh.exe is executed, or for certain events.

Netsh interacts with other operating system components using dynamic-link library (DLL) files. Each Netsh helper DLL provides an extensive set of features called a context, which is a group of commands specific to a networking component. For example, Dhcpmon.dll provides netsh the context and set of commands necessary to configure and manage DHCP servers.

## Attackers can register a netsh helper with this command

     netsh.exe add helper C:\Path\file.dll

## The following registry key stores the paths to the helpers

    HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Netsh
