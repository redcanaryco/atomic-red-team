# Invoke-AtomicRedTeam

## Setup

### Install Atomic Red Team

* Be sure to get permission and necessary approval before conducting tests. Unauthorized testing is a bad decision
and can potentially be a resume-generating event.

* Set up a test machine that would be similar to the build in your environment. Be sure you have your collection/EDR
solution in place, and that the endpoint is checking in and active. It is best to have AV turned off.

We made installing Atomic Red Team extremely easy.

For those running Atomic Red Team on MacOS or Linux download and install PowerShell Core.

[Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-core-on-linux?view=powershell-6)
[MacOS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-core-on-macos?view=powershell-6)

Once the environment is ready, run PowerShell as an adminstrator and run the following PowerShell one liner:

`IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/master/execution-frameworks/Invoke-AtomicRedTeam/install-atomicredteam.ps1'); Install-AtomicRedTeam -verbose`

[Source](install-atomicredteam.ps1)

By default, it will download and Install Atomic Red Team to `<BASEPATH>\AtomicRedTeam`

Where `<BASEPATH>` is `C:` in Windows or `~` in Linux/MacOS

Running the [Install script](install-atomicredteam.ps1) locally provides three parameters:

InstallPath
- Where ART is to be Installed

    `Install-AtomicRedTeam -InstallPath c:\tools\`

DownloadPath
- Where ART is to be downloaded

    `Install-AtomicRedTeam -DownloadPath c:\tools\`

Force
- Force the new installation removing any previous installations in -InstallPath. **BE CAREFUL this will delete the entire install path folder**

	`Install-AtomicRedTeam -Force`

### Manual


`set-executionpolicy Unrestricted`

[PowerShell-Yaml](https://github.com/cloudbase/powershell-yaml) is required to parse Atomic yaml files:


`Install-Module -Name powershell-yaml`

`import-module .\Invoke-AtomicRedTeam\Invoke-AtomicRedTeam.psm1`

## Getting Started

Before you can use the **_Invoke-AtomicTest_** function, you must first import the module:

```powershell
Import-Module C:\AtomicRedTeam\execution-frameworks\Invoke-AtomicRedTeam\Invoke-AtomicRedTeam\Invoke-AtomicRedTeam.psm1
```

Note: Your path to the **_Invoke-AtomicRedTeam.psm1_** may be different.

#### Execute All Tests

Execute all Atomic tests:

```powershell
Invoke-AtomicTest All
```

This assumes your atomics folder is in the default location of `<BASEPATH>\AtomicRedTeam\atomics`

Where `<BASEPATH>` is `C:` in Windows or `~` in Linux/MacOS

You can override the default path to the atomics folder using the `$PSDefaultParameterValues` preference variable as shown below.

```
$PSDefaultParameterValues = @{"Invoke-AtomicTest:PathToAtomicsFolder"="C:\Users\myuser\Documents\code\atomic-red-team\atomics"}
```

Tip: Add this to your PowerShell profile so it is always set to your preferred default value.

#### Execute All Tests - Specific Directory

Specify a path to atomics folder, example C:\AtomicRedTeam\atomics

```powershell
Invoke-AtomicTest All -PathToAtomicsFolder C:\AtomicRedTeam\atomics
```

#### Display Test Details without Executing the Test

Show the attack commands:

```powershell
Invoke-AtomicTest All -ShowDetails
```

Show the Prereq commands:

```powershell
Invoke-AtomicTest All -CheckPrereqs -ShowDetails
```

Show the Cleanup commands:

```powershell
Invoke-AtomicTest All -Cleanup -ShowDetails
```

Using the `ShowDetails` switch causes the test details to be printed to the screen and allows for easy copy and paste execution.
Note: you may need to change the path where the test definitions are found with the `PathToAtomicsFolder` parameter.

#### Execute All Attacks for a Given Technique

```powershell
Invoke-AtomicTest T1117
```

By default, test execution details are written to `Invoke-AtomicTest-ExecutionLog.csv` in the current directory.

#### Specify an Alternate Path for the Execution Log

```powershell
Invoke-AtomicTest T1117 -ExecutionLogPath 'C:\Temp\mylog.csv'
```

By default, test execution details are written to `Invoke-AtomicTest-ExecutionLog.csv` in the current directory. Use the `-ExecutionLogPath` parameter to write to a different file. Nothing is logged in the execution log when only running pre-requisite checks with `-CheckPrereqs` or cleanup commands with `-Cleanup`. Use the `-NoExecutionLog` switch to not write execution details to disk.

#### Check that Prerequistes for a Given Technique are met

```powershell
Invoke-AtomicTest T1117 -CheckPrereqs
```

For the "command_prompt", "bash", and "sh" executors, if any of the prereq_command's return a non-zero exit code, the pre-requisites are not met. Example: **fltmc.exe filters | findstr #{sysmon_driver}**

For the "powershell" executor, the prereq_command's are run as a script block and the script must return 0 if the pre-requisites are met. Example: **if(Test-Path C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe) { 0 } else { -1 }**

Pre-requisites will also be reported as not met if the test is defined with `elevation_required: true` but the current context is not elevated. You can still execute an attack even if the pre-requisites are not met but execution may fail.

#### Execute Specific Attacks (by Attack Number) for a Given Technique

```powershell
Invoke-AtomicTest T1117 -TestNumbers 1, 2
```

#### Execute Specific Attacks (by Attack Name) for a Given Technique

```powershell
Invoke-AtomicTest T1117 -TestNames "Regsvr32 remote COM scriptlet execution","Regsvr32 local DLL execution"
```
#### Specify Input Parameters on the Command Line

```powershell
$myArgs = @{ "file_name" = "c:\Temp\myfile.txt"; "ads_filename" = "C:\Temp\ads-file.txt"  }
Invoke-AtomicTest T1158 -TestNames "Create ADS command prompt" -InputArgs $myArgs
```

You can specify a subset of the input parameters via the command line. Any input parameters not explicitly defined will maintain their default values from the test definition yaml.

#### Run the Cleanup Commands For the Specified Test

```powershell
Invoke-AtomicTest T1089 -TestNames "Uninstall Sysmon" -Cleanup
```

## Additional Examples

If you would like output when running tests using the following:

#### Informational Stream

```powershell
Invoke-AtomicTest T1117 -InformationAction Continue
```

#### Verbose Stream

```powershell
Invoke-AtomicTest T1117 -Verbose
```

#### Debug Stream

```powershell
Invoke-AtomicTest T1117 -Debug
```

#### Confirm

To run all tests without confirming them run using the Confirm switch to false

```powershell
Invoke-AtomicTest T1117 -Confirm:$false
```

Or you can set your `$ConfirmPreference` to 'Medium'

```powershell
$ConfirmPreference = 'Medium'
Invoke-AtomicTest T1117
```
