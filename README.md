# Atomic Red Team

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team)

Atomic Red Team™ is library of tests mapped to the
[MITRE ATT&CK®](https://attack.mitre.org/) framework. Security teams can use
Atomic Red Team to quickly, portably, and reproducibly test their environments.

## Get started

You can execute atomic tests directly from the command line, no installation
required. See the [Getting started](https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/wiki/Getting-Started)
page of our wiki.

For a more robust testing experience, consider using an execution framework like
[Invoke-Atomic](https://github.com/redcanaryco/invoke-atomicredteam).

## Learn more

The Atomic Red Team documentation is available as a [wiki](https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/wiki/).
