    Adversaries may delete TeamViewer log files to hide activity. This should provide a high true-positive alert ration.
    This test just places the files in a non-TeamViewer folder, a detection would just check for a deletion event matching the TeamViewer
    log file format of TeamViewer_##.log. Upon execution, no output will be displayed. Use File Explorer to verify the folder was deleted.
