  description: |
    This test simulates an attack where PowerShell is used to detect connected USB or other removable storage devices and gather a list of specific document files 
    (e.g., .docx, .xls, .txt, .pdf). The command works by first identifying removable drives on the system and then recursively searching through each one for files 
    matching the targeted extensions. If no removable drives are present, the script will return a message stating that no media is detected. This behavior mimics 
    how adversaries might scan for sensitive documents on removable devices for exfiltration or analysis.
