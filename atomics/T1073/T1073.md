# T1073 - DLL Side-Loading
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1073)
<blockquote>Programs may specify DLLs that are loaded at runtime. Programs that improperly or vaguely specify a required DLL may be open to a vulnerability in which an unintended DLL is loaded. Side-loading vulnerabilities specifically occur when Windows Side-by-Side (WinSxS) manifests (Citation: MSDN Manifests) are not explicit enough about characteristics of the DLL to be loaded. Adversaries may take advantage of a legitimate program that is vulnerable to side-loading to load a malicious DLL. (Citation: Stewart 2014)

Adversaries likely use this technique as a means of masking actions they perform under a legitimate, trusted system or software process.</blockquote>
