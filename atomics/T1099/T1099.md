# T1099 - Timestomp
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1099)
<blockquote>Timestomping is a technique that modifies the timestamps of a file (the modify, access, create, and change times), often to mimic files that are in the same folder. This is done, for example, on files that have been modified or created by the adversary so that they do not appear conspicuous to forensic investigators or file analysis tools. Timestomping may be used along with file name [Masquerading](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036) to hide malware and tools. (Citation: WindowsIR Anti-Forensic Techniques)</blockquote>

## Atomic Tests

- [Atomic Test #1 - Set a file's access timestamp](#atomic-test-1---set-a-files-access-timestamp)

- [Atomic Test #2 - Set a file's modification timestamp](#atomic-test-2---set-a-files-modification-timestamp)

- [Atomic Test #3 - Set a file's creation timestamp](#atomic-test-3---set-a-files-creation-timestamp)


<br/>

## Atomic Test #1 - Set a file's access timestamp
Stomps on the access timestamp of a file

**Supported Platforms:** Linux, macOS


#### Inputs
| Name | Description | Type | Default Value | 
|------|-------------|------|---------------|
| target_filename | Path of file that we are going to stomp on last access time | Path | /opt/filename|

#### Run it with `sh`!
```
touch -a -t 197001010000.00 #{target_filename}
```
<br/>
<br/>

## Atomic Test #2 - Set a file's modification timestamp
Stomps on the modification timestamp of a file

**Supported Platforms:** Linux, macOS


#### Inputs
| Name | Description | Type | Default Value | 
|------|-------------|------|---------------|
| target_filename | Path of file that we are going to stomp on last access time | Path | /opt/filename|

#### Run it with `sh`!
```
touch -m -t 197001010000.00 #{target_filename}
```
<br/>
<br/>

## Atomic Test #3 - Set a file's creation timestamp
Stomps on the create timestamp of a file

Setting the creation timestamp requires changing the system clock and reverting.
Sudo or root privileges are required to change date. Use with caution.

**Supported Platforms:** Linux, macOS


#### Inputs
| Name | Description | Type | Default Value | 
|------|-------------|------|---------------|
| target_filename | Path of file that we are going to stomp on last access time | Path | /opt/filename|

#### Run it with `sh`!
```
NOW=$(date)
date -s "1970-01-01 00:00:00"
touch #{target_filename}
date -s "$NOW"
stat #{target_filename}
```
