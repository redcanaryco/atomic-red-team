- name: Set a file's creation timestamp
  description: |
    Stomps on the create timestamp of a file

    Setting the creation timestamp requires changing the system clock and reverting.
    Sudo or root privileges are required to change date. Use with caution.

- name: Modify file timestamps using reference file
  description: |
    Modifies the `modify` and `access` timestamps using the timestamps of a specified reference file.

    This technique was used by the threat actor Rocke during the compromise of Linux web servers.
