# T1564.001 - Hidden Files and Directories
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1564.001)
<blockquote>Adversaries may set files and directories to be hidden to evade detection mechanisms. To prevent normal users from accidentally changing special files on a system, most operating systems have the concept of a ‘hidden’ file. These files don’t show up when a user browses the file system with a GUI or when using normal commands on the command line. Users must explicitly ask to show the hidden files either via a series of Graphical User Interface (GUI) prompts or with command line switches (<code>dir /a</code> for Windows and <code>ls –a</code> for Linux and macOS).

On Linux and Mac, users can mark specific files as hidden simply by putting a “.” as the first character in the file or folder name  (Citation: Sofacy Komplex Trojan) (Citation: Antiquated Mac Malware). Files and folders that start with a period, ‘.’, are by default hidden from being viewed in the Finder application and standard command-line utilities like “ls”. Users must specifically change settings to have these files viewable.

Files on macOS can also be marked with the UF_HIDDEN flag which prevents them from being seen in Finder.app, but still allows them to be seen in Terminal.app (Citation: WireLurker). On Windows, users can mark specific files as hidden by using the attrib.exe binary. Many applications create these hidden files and folders to store information so that it doesn’t clutter up the user’s workspace. For example, SSH utilities create a .ssh folder that’s hidden and contains the user’s known hosts and keys.

Adversaries can use this to their advantage to hide files and folders anywhere on the system and evading a typical user or system analysis that does not incorporate investigation of hidden files.</blockquote>

## Atomic Test #3 - Create Windows System File with Attrib
Creates a file and marks it as a system file using the attrib.exe utility. Upon execution, open the file in file explorer then open Properties > Details
and observe that the Attributes are "SA" for System and Archive.

**Supported Platforms:** Windows




#### Inputs:
| Name | Description | Type | Default Value | 
|------|-------------|------|---------------|
| file_to_modify | File to modify using Attrib command | string | %temp%&#92;T1564.001.txt|


#### Attack Commands: Run with `command_prompt`!  Elevation Required (e.g. root or admin) 


```cmd
attrib.exe +s #{file_to_modify}
```

#### Cleanup Commands:
```cmd
del /A:S #{file_to_modify} >nul 2>&1
```



#### Dependencies:  Run with `command_prompt`!
##### Description: The file must exist on disk at specified location (#{file_to_modify})
##### Check Prereq Commands:
```cmd
IF EXIST #{file_to_modify} ( EXIT 0 ) ELSE ( EXIT 1 ) 
```
##### Get Prereq Commands:
```cmd
echo system_Attrib_T1564.001 >> #{file_to_modify}
```

## Atomic Test #4 - Create Windows Hidden File with Attrib
Creates a file and marks it as hidden using the attrib.exe utility.Upon execution, open File Epxplorer and enable View > Hidden Items. Then, open Properties > Details on the file
and observe that the Attributes are "SH" for System and Hidden.

**Supported Platforms:** Windows




#### Inputs:
| Name | Description | Type | Default Value | 
|------|-------------|------|---------------|
| file_to_modify | File to modify using Attrib command | string | %temp%&#92;T1564.001.txt|


#### Attack Commands: Run with `command_prompt`!  Elevation Required (e.g. root or admin) 


```cmd
attrib.exe +h #{file_to_modify}
```

#### Cleanup Commands:
```cmd
del /A:H #{file_to_modify} >nul 2>&1
```



#### Dependencies:  Run with `command_prompt`!
##### Description: The file must exist on disk at specified location (#{file_to_modify})
##### Check Prereq Commands:
```cmd
IF EXIST #{file_to_modify} ( EXIT 0 ) ELSE ( EXIT 1 ) 
```
##### Get Prereq Commands:
```cmd
echo system_Attrib_T1564.001 >> #{file_to_modify}
```
