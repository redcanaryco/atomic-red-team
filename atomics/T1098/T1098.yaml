  description: |
    Create a random atr-nnnnnnnn account and add it to a domain group (by default, Domain Admins). 

    The quickest way to run it is against a domain controller, using `-Session` of `Invoke-AtomicTest`. Alternatively,
    you need to install PS Module ActiveDirectory (in prereqs) and run the script with appropriare AD privileges to 
    create the user and alter the group. Automatic installation of the dependency requires an elevated session, 
    and is unlikely to work with Powershell Core (untested).

    If you consider running this test against a production Active Directory, the good practise is to create a dedicated
    service account whose delegation is given onto a dedicated OU for user creation and deletion, as well as delegated
    as group manager of the target group.

    Example: `Invoke-AtomicTest -Session $session 'T1098' -TestNames "Domain Account and Group Manipulate" -InputArgs @{"group" = "DNSAdmins" }`

Permissions like AppRoleAssignment.ReadWrite.All or RoleManagement.ReadWrite.Directory in particular can be a valuable target for a threat actor.
    This technique will create a new app, with the provided name, and give it the provided permission. But if you prefer to add credentials to an existing app, replace in the code: "Get-AzureADApplication" instead of "New-AzureADServicePrincipal".

    Attempt to change the password of the current domain user in order to check password policy. Ideally, you would only run this atomic test to verify that your password policy is blocking the use of the new password.
    If the password is succesfully changed to the new password, the credential file will be updated to reflect the new password. You can then run the atomic manually and specify a new password of your choosing, however the
    password policy will likely prevent you from setting the password back to what it was.

- name: GCP - Delete Service Account Key
  auto_generated_guid: 7ece1dea-49f1-4d62-bdcc-5801e3292510
  description: |
    This Atomic will: 
      - Create a service account
      - Create a service account key, 
      - Store the result of retrieving a single key for that service account as a variable
      - Pass that variable for deletion
      - Delete the service account
    
    The idea for this Atomic came from a Rule published by the Elastic team.

    Identifies the deletion of an Identity and Access Management (IAM) service account key in Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
    Each service account is associated with two sets of public/private RSA key pairs that are used to authenticate. 
    If a key is deleted, the application will no longer be able to access Google Cloud resources using that key. A security best practice is to rotate your service account keys regularly.
