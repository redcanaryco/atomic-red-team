# T1036.005 - Masquerading: Match Legitimate Name or Location
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036/005)
<blockquote>Adversaries may match or approximate the name or location of legitimate files or resources when naming/placing them. This is done for the sake of evading defenses and observation. This may be done by placing an executable in a commonly trusted directory (ex: under System32) or giving it the name of a legitimate, trusted program (ex: svchost.exe). In containerized environments, this may also be done by creating a resource in a namespace that matches the naming convention of a container pod or cluster. Alternatively, a file or container image name given may be a close approximation to legitimate programs/images or something innocuous.

Adversaries may also use the same icon of the file they are trying to mimic.</blockquote>

## Atomic Test #2 - Masquerade as a built-in system executable
Launch an executable that attempts to masquerade as a legitimate executable.

**Supported Platforms:** Windows


**auto_generated_guid:** 35eb8d16-9820-4423-a2a1-90c4f5edd9ca





#### Inputs:
| Name | Description | Type | Default Value |
|------|-------------|------|---------------|

```powershell
Add-Type -TypeDefinition @'
public class Test {
    public static void Main(string[] args) {
        System.Console.WriteLine("tweet, tweet");
    }
}
