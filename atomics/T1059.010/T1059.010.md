# T1059.010 - Command and Scripting Interpreter: AutoHotKey & AutoIT
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/010)
<blockquote>

Adversaries may execute commands and perform malicious tasks using AutoIT and AutoHotKey automation scripts. AutoIT and AutoHotkey (AHK) are scripting languages that enable users to automate Windows tasks. These automation scripts can be used to perform a wide variety of actions, such as clicking on buttons, entering text, and opening and closing programs.(Citation: AutoIT)(Citation: AutoHotKey)

Adversaries may use AHK (`.ahk`) and AutoIT (`.au3`) scripts to execute malicious code on a victim's system. For example, adversaries have used for AHK to execute payloads and other modular malware such as keyloggers. Adversaries have also used custom AHK files containing embedded malware as [Phishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566) payloads.(Citation: Splunk DarkGate)

These scripts may also be compiled into self-contained executable payloads (`.exe`).(Citation: AutoIT)(Citation: AutoHotKey)

## Atomic Tests

- [Atomic Test #1 - AutoHotKey script execution](#atomic-test-1---autohotkey-script-execution)


<br/>

## Atomic Test #1 - AutoHotKey script execution
An adversary may attempt to execute malicious script using AutoHotKey software instead of regular terminal like powershell or cmd. A messagebox will be displayed and calculator will popup when the script is executed successfully

**Supported Platforms:** Windows


**auto_generated_guid:** 7b5d350e-f758-43cc-a761-8e3f6b052a03
