# T1107 - File Deletion
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1107)
<blockquote>Malware, tools, or other non-native files dropped or created on a system by an adversary may leave traces behind as to what was done within a network and how. Adversaries may remove these files over the course of an intrusion to keep their footprint low or remove them at the end as part of the post-intrusion cleanup process.

There are tools available from the host operating system to perform cleanup, but adversaries may use other tools as well. Examples include native [cmd](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0106) functions such as DEL, secure deletion tools such as Windows Sysinternals SDelete, or other third-party file deletion tools.

## Atomic Test #14 - Delete TeamViewer Log Files
Adversaries may delete TeamViewer log files to hide activity. This should provide a high true-positive alert ration.
