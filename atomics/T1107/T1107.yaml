    Delete a single prefetch file.  Deletion of prefetch files is a known anti-forensic technique. To verify execution, Run "(Get-ChildItem -Path "$Env:SystemRoot\prefetch\*.pf" | Measure-Object).Count"
    before and after the test to verify that the number of prefetch files decreases by 1.

- name: Delete TeamViewer Log Files
  description: |
    Adversaries may delete TeamViewer log files to hide activity. This should provide a high true-positive alert ration.
    This test just places the files in a non-TeamViewer folder, a detection would just check for a deletion event matching the TeamViewer
    log file format of TeamViewer_##.log. Upon execution, no output will be displayed. Use File Explorer to verify the folder was deleted.
