# T1613 -  Container and Resource Discovery
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1613/)
<blockquote>Adversaries may attempt to discover containers and other resources that are available within a containers environment. Other resources may include images, deployments, pods, nodes.
In Docker, logs may leak information about the environment, such as the environment’s configuration, which services are available, and what cloud provider the victim may be utilizing. The discovery of these resources may inform an adversary’s next steps in the environment, such as how to perform lateral movement and which methods to utilize for execution.</blockquote>
