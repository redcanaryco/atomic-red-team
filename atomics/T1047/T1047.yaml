- name: WMI Reconnaissance Users
  description: |
    An adversary might use WMI to list all local User Accounts. 
    When the test completes , there should be local user accounts information displayed on the command line.

      wmic useraccount get /ALL /format:csv
    
- name: WMI Reconnaissance Processes
  description: |
    An adversary might use WMI to list Processes running on the compromised host.
    When the test completes , there should be running processes listed on the command line.

- name: WMI Reconnaissance Software
  description: |
    An adversary might use WMI to list installed Software hotfix and patches.
    When the test completes, there should be a list of installed patches and when they were installed.

- name: WMI Reconnaissance List Remote Services
  description: |
    An adversary might use WMI to check if a certain Remote Service is running on a remote device. 
    When the test completes, a service information will be displayed on the screen if it exists.
    A common feedback message is that "No instance(s) Available" if the service queried is not running.
    A common error message is "Node - (provided IP or default)  ERROR Description =The RPC server is unavailable" 
    if the provided remote host is unreacheable

- name: WMI Execute Local Process
  description: |
    This test uses wmic.exe to execute a process on the local host.
    When the test completes , a new process will be started locally .A notepad application will be started when input is left on default.

- name: WMI Execute Remote Process
  description: |
    This test uses wmic.exe to execute a process on a remote host. Specify a valid value for remote IP using the node parameter.
    To clean up, provide the same node input as the one provided to run the test
    A common error message is "Node - (provided IP or default)  ERROR Description =The RPC server is unavailable" if the default or provided IP is unreachable
