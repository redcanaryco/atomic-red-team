# T1201 - Password Policy Discovery
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1201)
<blockquote>Password policies for networks are a way to enforce complex passwords that are difficult to guess or crack through [Brute Force](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110). An adversary may attempt to access detailed information about the password policy used within an enterprise network. This would help the adversary to create a list of common passwords and launch dictionary and/or brute force attacks which adheres to the policy (e.g. if the minimum password length should be 8, then not trying passwords such as 'pass123'; not checking for more than 3-4 passwords per account if the lockout is set to 6 as to not lock out accounts).

Password policies can be set and discovered on Windows, Linux, and macOS systems. (Citation: Superuser Linux Password Policies) (Citation: Jamf User Password Policies)

### Windows
* <code>net accounts</code>
* <code>net accounts /domain</code>

### Linux
* <code>chage -l <username></code>
* <code>cat /etc/pam.d/common-password</code>

### macOS
* <code>pwpolicy getaccountpolicies</code></blockquote>
