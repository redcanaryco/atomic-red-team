# T1071.001 - Web Protocols
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1071.001)
<blockquote>Adversaries may communicate using application layer protocols associated with web traffic to avoid detection/network filtering by blending in with existing traffic. Commands to the remote system, and often the results of those commands, will be embedded within the protocol traffic between the client and server. 

Protocols such as HTTP and HTTPS that carry web traffic may be very common in environments. HTTP/S packets have many fields and headers in which data can be concealed. An adversary may abuse these protocols to communicate with systems under their control within a victim network while also mimicking normal, expected traffic. </blockquote>

## Atomic Tests

- [Atomic Test #1 - Malicious User Agents - Powershell](#atomic-test-1---malicious-user-agents---powershell)

- [Atomic Test #2 - Malicious User Agents - CMD](#atomic-test-2---malicious-user-agents---cmd)

- [Atomic Test #3 - Malicious User Agents - Nix](#atomic-test-3---malicious-user-agents---nix)

## Atomic Test #1 - Malicious User Agents - Powershell
This test simulates an infected host beaconing to command and control. Upon execution, no output will be displayed. 
Use an application such as Wireshark to record the session and observe user agent strings and responses.

**Supported Platforms:** Windows




#### Inputs:
| Name | Description | Type | Default Value | 
|------|-------------|------|---------------|
| domain | Default domain to simulate against | string | www.google.com|
