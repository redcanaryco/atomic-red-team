# T1093 - Process Hollowing
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1093)
<blockquote>Process hollowing occurs when a process is created in a suspended state then its memory is unmapped and replaced with malicious code. Similar to [Process Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055), execution of the malicious code is masked under a legitimate process and may evade defenses and detection analysis. (Citation: Leitch Hollowing) (Citation: Endgame Process Injection July 2017)</blockquote>
