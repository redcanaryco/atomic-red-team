    Copies and then runs a simple binary (just outputting "the cake is a lie"), that was packed by UPX.

    The UPX magic number (`0x55505821`, "`UPX!`") was changed to (`0x4c4f5452`, "`LOTR`"). This prevents the binary from being detected
    by some methods, and especially UPX is not able to uncompress it any more.
