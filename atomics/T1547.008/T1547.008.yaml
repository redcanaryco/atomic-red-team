  auto_generated_guid: 8ecef16d-d289-46b4-917b-0dba6dc81cf1
  description: |
    The following Atomic will modify an undocumented registry key that may be abused to load a arbitrary DLL into LSASS. 

    Upon execution, the registry key will be modified and a value will contain the path to the DLL. 
    Reference: https://blog.xpnsec.com/exploring-mimikatz-part-1/ and source https://github.com/oxfemale/LogonCredentialsSteal
    Note that if any LSA based protection is enabled, this will most likely not be successful with LSASS.exe loading the DLL.
