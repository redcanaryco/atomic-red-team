# T1059 - Command and Scripting Interpreter
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059)
<blockquote>Adversaries may abuse command and script interpreters to execute commands, scripts, or binaries. These interfaces and languages provide ways of interacting with computer systems and are a common feature across many different platforms. Most systems come with some built-in command-line interface and scripting capabilities, for example, macOS and Linux distributions include some flavor of [Unix Shell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/004) while Windows installations include the [Windows Command Shell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/003) and [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001).

There are also cross-platform interpreters such as [Python](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/006), as well as those commonly associated with client applications such as [JavaScript](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/007) and [Visual Basic](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/005).

Adversaries may abuse these technologies in various ways as a means of executing arbitrary commands. Commands and scripts can be embedded in [Initial Access](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0001) payloads delivered to victims as lure documents or as secondary payloads downloaded from an existing C2. Adversaries may also execute commands through interactive terminals/shells, as well as utilize various [Remote Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021) in order to achieve remote Execution.(Citation: Powershell Remote Commands)(Citation: Cisco IOS Software Integrity Assurance - Command History)(Citation: Remote Shell Execution in Python)</blockquote>

## Atomic Tests

- [Atomic Test #1 - AutoIt Script Execution](#atomic-test-1---autoit-script-execution)


<br/>

## Atomic Test #1 - AutoIt Script Execution
An adversary may attempt to execute suspicious or malicious script using AutoIt software instead of regular terminal like powershell or cmd. Calculator will popup when the script is executed successfully.

**Supported Platforms:** Windows


**auto_generated_guid:** a9b93f17-31cb-435d-a462-5e838a2a6026





#### Inputs:
| Name | Description | Type | Default Value |
|------|-------------|------|---------------|
| script_path | AutoIt Script Path | path | PathToAtomicsFolder&#92;T1059&#92;src&#92;calc.au3|
| autoit_path | AutoIt Executable File Path | path | C:&#92;Program Files (x86)&#92;AutoIt3&#92;AutoIt3.exe|


#### Attack Commands: Run with `powershell`! 


```powershell
Start-Process -FilePath "#{autoit_path}" -ArgumentList "#{script_path}"
```




#### Dependencies:  Run with `powershell`!
##### Description: AutoIt executable file must exist on disk at the specified location (#{autoit_path})
##### Check Prereq Commands:
```powershell
if(Test-Path "#{autoit_path}") {
    exit 0
} else {
    exit 1
}
```
##### Get Prereq Commands:
```powershell
New-Item -Type Directory "PathToAtomicsFolder\..\ExternalPayloads\" -ErrorAction Ignore -Force | Out-Null
$AutoItURL = "https://www.autoitscript.com/cgi-bin/getfile.pl?autoit3/autoit-v3-setup.exe"
$InstallerPath = "$PathToAtomicsFolder\..\ExternalPayloads\autoit-v3-setup.exe"
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $AutoItURL -OutFile $InstallerPath
Start-Process -FilePath $InstallerPath -ArgumentList "/S" -Wait
```
