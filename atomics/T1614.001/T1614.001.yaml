    Identify System language with the `localectl` command.

    Upon successful execution, the key `System Locale` from the output will contain the
    `LANG` environment variable that has the 5 character locale result that can be looked
    up to correlate the language and territory.

   Identify System language by checking the environment variables

   Upon successful execution, the 5 character locale result can be looked up to
   correlate the language and territory. Environment query commands are likely
   to run with a pattern match command e.g. `env | grep LANG`

   Note: `env` and `printenv` will usually provide the same results. `set` is
   also used as a builtin command that does not generate syscall telemetry but
   does provide a list of the environment variables.

   WMIC (Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line) is a command-line tool that provides a simplified interface to query and manage Windows system configurations, processes, and hardware information using WMI. 
   
   The command in this test retrieves information about the system's locale, operating system language, and multilingual user interface (MUI) languages.

  description: |
   This PowerShell script collects key system settings, such as the UI language, user language preferences, system locale, current culture, UI culture, and time zone, into a hash table. 
   
   It then outputs these settings in a readable key-value format directly to the terminal. The script is simple and efficient for quickly displaying system configuration details.
