# T1546.007 - Event Triggered Execution: Netsh Helper DLL
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/007)
<blockquote>Adversaries may establish persistence by executing malicious content triggered by Netsh Helper DLLs. Netsh.exe (also referred to as Netshell) is a command-line scripting utility used to interact with the network configuration of a system. It contains functionality to add helper DLLs for extending functionality of the utility.(Citation: TechNet Netsh) The paths to registered netsh.exe helper DLLs are entered into the Windows Registry at <code>HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Netsh</code>.

Adversaries can use netsh.exe helper DLLs to trigger execution of arbitrary code in a persistent manner. This execution would take place anytime netsh.exe is executed, which could happen automatically, with another persistence technique, or if other software (ex: VPN) is present on the system that executes netsh.exe as part of its normal functionality.(Citation: Github Netsh Helper CS Beacon)(Citation: Demaske Netsh Persistence)</blockquote>

## Atomic Test #1 - Netsh Helper DLL Registration
You can register a "helper dll" with Netsh as a persistance mechanism. The code in the dll is executed every time netsh.exe is called.
The NetshHelper.dll provided with the atomic will simply launch notepad when netsh.exe is run.
