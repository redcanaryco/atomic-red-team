# T1547.010 - Port Monitors
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/010)
<blockquote>Adversaries may use port monitors to run an attacker supplied DLL during system boot for persistence or privilege escalation. A port monitor can be set through the <code>AddMonitor</code> API call to set a DLL to be loaded at startup. (Citation: AddMonitor) This DLL can be located in <code>C:\Windows\System32</code> and will be loaded by the print spooler service, spoolsv.exe, on boot. The spoolsv.exe process also runs under SYSTEM level permissions. (Citation: Bloxham) Alternatively, an arbitrary DLL can be loaded if permissions allow writing a fully-qualified pathname for that DLL to <code>HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print\Monitors</code>. 

The Registry key contains entries for the following:

* Local Port
* Standard TCP/IP Port
* USB Monitor
* WSD Port

Adversaries can use this technique to load malicious code at startup that will persist on system reboot and execute as SYSTEM.</blockquote>

## Atomic Tests

- [Atomic Test #1 - Add Port Monitor persistence in Registry](#atomic-test-1---add-port-monitor-persistence-in-registry)


<br/>

## Atomic Test #1 - Add Port Monitor persistence in Registry
Add key-value pair to a Windows Port Monitor registry. On the subsequent reboot dll will be execute under spoolsv with NT AUTHORITY/SYSTEM privilege.

**Supported Platforms:** Windows




#### Inputs:
| Name | Description | Type | Default Value | 
|------|-------------|------|---------------|
| monitor_dll | Addition to port monitor registry key. Normally refers to a DLL name in C:&#92;Windows&#92;System32. arbitrary DLL can be loaded if permissions allow writing a fully-qualified pathname for that DLL. | Path | C:&#92;Path&#92;AtomicRedTeam.dll|


#### Attack Commands: Run with `command_prompt`!  Elevation Required (e.g. root or admin) 


```cmd
reg add "hklm\system\currentcontrolset\control\print\monitors\ART" /v "Atomic Red Team" /d "#{monitor_dll}" /t REG_SZ
```

#### Cleanup Commands:
```cmd
reg delete "hklm\system\currentcontrolset\control\print\monitors\ART"
```
