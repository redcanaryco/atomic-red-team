This technique was used by threat actor Rocke during the exploitation of Linux web servers. This requires the `glibc` package.\n\nUpon successful execution, bash will echo `../bin/T1055.so` to /etc/ld.so.preload. \n"

- name: Shared Library Injection via LD_PRELOAD
  description: |
    This test injects a shared object library via the LD_PRELOAD environment variable to execute. This technique was used by threat actor Rocke during the exploitation of Linux web servers. This requires the `glibc` package.

    Upon successful execution, bash will utilize LD_PRELOAD to load the shared object library `/etc/ld.so.preload`. Output will be via stdout.
