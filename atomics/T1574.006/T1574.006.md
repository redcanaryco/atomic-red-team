# T1574.006 - LD_PRELOAD
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1574.006)
<blockquote>Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking environment variables used to load libraries. Adversaries may set the LD_PRELOAD environment variable to point at malicious libraries that match the name of legitimate libraries which are requested by a victim program, causing the operating system to load the adversary's malicious code upon execution of the victim program. This environment variable is used to control when different shared libraries are loaded by a program.(Citation: TLDP Shared Libraries) Libraries specified by this variable with be loaded and mapped into memory by <code>dlopen()</code> and <code>mmap()</code> respectively.(Citation: Code Injection on Linux and macOS) (Citation: Uninformed Needle) (Citation: Phrack halfdead 1997)

LD_PRELOAD hijacking is a method of executing arbitrary code, abusing how environment variables are used to load alternate shared libraries during process execution. LD_PRELOAD hijacking may allow access to the process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges. Execution via LD_PRELOAD hijacking may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.</blockquote>

## Atomic Tests

- [Atomic Test #1 - Shared Library Injection via /etc/ld.so.preload](#atomic-test-1---shared-library-injection-via-etcldsopreload)

- [Atomic Test #2 - Shared Library Injection via LD_PRELOAD](#atomic-test-2---shared-library-injection-via-ld_preload)


<br/>

## Atomic Test #1 - Shared Library Injection via /etc/ld.so.preload
This test adds a shared library to the `ld.so.preload` list to execute and intercept API calls. This technique was used by threat actor Rocke during the exploitation of Linux web servers. This requires the `glibc` package.

Upon successful execution, bash will echo `../bin/T1574.006.so` to /etc/ld.so.preload. 

**Supported Platforms:** Linux




#### Inputs:
| Name | Description | Type | Default Value | 
|------|-------------|------|---------------|
| path_to_shared_library_source | Path to a shared library source code | Path | PathToAtomicsFolder/T1574.006/src/Linux/T1574.006.c|
| path_to_shared_library | Path to a shared library object | Path | PathToAtomicsFolder/T1574.006/bin/T1574.006.so|


#### Attack Commands: Run with `bash`!  Elevation Required (e.g. root or admin) 


```bash
sudo sh -c 'echo #{path_to_shared_library} > /etc/ld.so.preload'
```

#### Cleanup Commands:
```bash
sudo sed -i '/#{path_to_shared_library}/d' /etc/ld.so.preload
```



#### Dependencies:  Run with `bash`!
##### Description: The shared library must exist on disk at specified location (#{path_to_shared_library})
##### Check Prereq Commands:
```bash
if [ -f #{path_to_shared_library ]; then exit 0; else exit 1; fi; 
```
##### Get Prereq Commands:
```bash
gcc -shared -fPIC -o #{path_to_shared_library} #{path_to_shared_library_source}
```

## Atomic Test #2 - Shared Library Injection via LD_PRELOAD
This test injects a shared object library via the LD_PRELOAD environment variable to execute. This technique was used by threat actor Rocke during the exploitation of Linux web servers. This requires the `glibc` package.

Upon successful execution, bash will utilize LD_PRELOAD to load the shared object library `/etc/ld.so.preload`. Output will be via stdout.

**Supported Platforms:** Linux




#### Inputs:
| Name | Description | Type | Default Value | 
|------|-------------|------|---------------|
| path_to_shared_library_source | Path to a shared library source code | Path | PathToAtomicsFolder/T1574.006/src/Linux/T1574.006.c|
| path_to_shared_library | Path to a shared library object | Path | PathToAtomicsFolder/T1574.006/bin/T1574.006.so|


#### Attack Commands: Run with `bash`! 


```bash
LD_PRELOAD=#{path_to_shared_library} ls
```




#### Dependencies:  Run with `bash`!
##### Description: The shared library must exist on disk at specified location (#{path_to_shared_library})
##### Check Prereq Commands:
```bash
if [ -f #{path_to_shared_library} ]; then exit 0; else exit 1; fi; 
```
##### Get Prereq Commands:
```bash
gcc -shared -fPIC -o #{path_to_shared_library} #{path_to_shared_library_source}
```
