# T1140 - Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1140)
<blockquote>Adversaries may use [Obfuscated Files or Information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027) to hide artifacts of an intrusion from analysis. They may require separate mechanisms to decode or deobfuscate that information depending on how they intend to use it. Methods for doing that include built-in functionality of malware, [Scripting](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1064), [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1086), or by using utilities present on the system.

One such example is use of [certutil](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0160) to decode a remote access tool portable executable file that has been hidden inside a certificate file. (Citation: Malwarebytes Targeted Attack against Saudi Arabia)

Another example is using the Windows <code>copy /b</code> command to reassemble binary fragments into a malicious payload. (Citation: Carbon Black Obfuscation Sept 2016)

Payloads may be compressed, archived, or encrypted in order to avoid detection.  These payloads may be used with [Obfuscated Files or Information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027) during Initial Access or later to mitigate detection. Sometimes a user's action may be required to open it for deobfuscation or decryption as part of [User Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204). The user may also be required to input a password to open a password protected compressed/encrypted file that was provided by the adversary. (Citation: Volexity PowerDuke November 2016) Adversaries may also used compressed or archived scripts, such as Javascript.</blockquote>

## Atomic Test #1 - Deobfuscate/Decode Files Or Information
Encode/Decode executable

**Supported Platforms:** Windows


#### Inputs:
| Name | Description | Type | Default Value | 
|------|-------------|------|---------------|
| executable | name of executable | path | C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe|


#### Attack Commands: Run with `command_prompt`! 


```cmd
certutil -encode #{executable} %temp%\T1140_calc.txt
certutil -decode %temp%\T1140_calc.txt %temp%T1140_calc_decoded.exe
```

#### Cleanup Commands:
```
del %temp%\T1140_calc.txt >nul 2>&1
del %temp%T1140_calc_decoded.exe >nul 2>&1
```

## Atomic Test #2 - Certutil Rename and Decode
Rename certutil and decode a file. This is in reference to latest research by FireEye [here](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2018/09/apt10-targeting-japanese-corporations-using-updated-ttps.html)

**Supported Platforms:** Windows


#### Inputs:
| Name | Description | Type | Default Value | 
|------|-------------|------|---------------|
| executable | name of executable/file to decode | path | C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe|


#### Attack Commands: Run with `command_prompt`! 


```cmd
copy %windir%\system32\certutil.exe %temp%\tcm.tmp
%temp%\tcm.tmp -decode #{executable} %temp%\T1140.txt
```

#### Cleanup Commands:
```
del %temp%\tcm.tmp >nul 2>&1
del %temp%\T1140.txt >nul 2>&1
```
