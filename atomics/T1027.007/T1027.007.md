# T1027.007 - Obfuscated Files or Information: Dynamic API Resolution
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/007)
<blockquote>Adversaries may obfuscate then dynamically resolve API functions called by their malware in order to conceal malicious functionalities and impair defensive analysis. Malware commonly uses various [Native API](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1106) functions provided by the OS to perform various tasks such as those involving processes, files, and other system artifacts.

API functions called by malware may leave static artifacts such as strings in payload files. Defensive analysts may also uncover which functions a binary file may execute via an import address table (IAT) or other structures that help dynamically link calling code to the shared modules that provide functions.(Citation: Huntress API Hash)(Citation: IRED API Hashing)

To avoid static or other defensive analysis, adversaries may use dynamic API resolution to conceal malware characteristics and functionalities. Similar to [Software Packing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/002), dynamic API resolution may change file signatures and obfuscate malicious API function calls until they are resolved and invoked during runtime.

Various methods may be used to obfuscate malware calls to API functions. For example, hashes of function names are commonly stored in malware in lieu of literal strings. Malware can use these hashes (or other identifiers) to manually reproduce the linking and loading process using functions such as `GetProcAddress()` and `LoadLibrary()`. These hashes/identifiers can also be further obfuscated using encryption or other string manipulation tricks (requiring various forms of [Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1140) during execution).(Citation: BlackHat API Packers)(Citation: Drakonia HInvoke)(Citation: Huntress API Hash)</blockquote>

## Atomic Tests

<br/>

## Atomic Test #1 - Dynamic API Resolution-Ninja-syscall
This test calls NtCreateFile via API hashing and dynamic syscall resolution. I have dubbed this particular combination of techniques 'Ninja-syscall'. When successful, a new file named 'hello.log' will be created in the default user's temporary folder, which is a common location for a dropper.

**Supported Platforms:** Windows


**auto_generated_guid:** 578025d5-faa9-4f6d-8390-aae739d507e1





#### Inputs:
| Name | Description | Type | Default Value |
|------|-------------|------|---------------|
| exe_binary | PE binary | path | PathToAtomicsFolder&#92;T1027.007&#92;bin&#92;ninja_syscall1.exe|


#### Attack Commands: Run with `powershell`!  Elevation Required (e.g. root or admin) 


```powershell
Start-Process "#{exe_binary}"
Start-Sleep -Seconds 7
if (Test-Path "C:\Users\Default\AppData\Local\Temp\hello.log") { Remove-Item "C:\Users\Default\AppData\Local\Temp\hello.log" -Force; Write-Host "[+] hello.log removed." }
```

#### Cleanup Commands:
```powershell
if (Test-Path "C:\Users\Default\AppData\Local\Temp\hello.log") { Remove-Item "C:\Users\Default\AppData\Local\Temp\hello.log" -Force; Write-Host "[+] hello.log removed." }
```



#### Dependencies:  Run with `powershell`!
##### Description: Portable Executable to run must exist at specified location (#{exe_binary})
##### Check Prereq Commands:
```powershell
if (Test-Path "#{exe_binary}") {exit 0} else {exit 1}
```
##### Get Prereq Commands:
```powershell
New-Item -Type Directory (split-path "#{exe_binary}") -ErrorAction ignore | Out-Null
Invoke-WebRequest "https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/raw/master/atomics/T1027.007/bin/ninja_syscall1.exe" -OutFile "#{exe_binary}"
```
