# T1562.003 - Impair Defenses: Impair Command History Logging
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/003)
<blockquote>Adversaries may impair command history logging to hide commands they run on a compromised system. Various command interpreters keep track of the commands users type in their terminal so that users can retrace what they've done. 

On Linux and macOS, command history is tracked in a file pointed to by the environment variable <code>HISTFILE</code>. When a user logs off a system, this information is flushed to a file in the user's home directory called <code>~/.bash_history</code>. The <code>HISTCONTROL</code> environment variable keeps track of what should be saved by the <code>history</code> command and eventually into the <code>~/.bash_history</code> file when a user logs out. <code>HISTCONTROL</code> does not exist by default on macOS, but can be set by the user and will be respected.

Adversaries may clear the history environment variable (<code>unset HISTFILE</code>) or set the command history size to zero (<code>export HISTFILESIZE=0</code>) to prevent logging of commands. Additionally, <code>HISTCONTROL</code> can be configured to ignore commands that start with a space by simply setting it to "ignorespace". <code>HISTCONTROL</code> can also be set to ignore duplicate commands by setting it to "ignoredups". In some Linux systems, this is set by default to "ignoreboth" which covers both of the previous examples. This means that “ ls” will not be saved, but “ls” would be saved by history. Adversaries can abuse this to operate without leaving traces by simply prepending a space to all of their terminal commands. 

On Windows systems, the <code>PSReadLine</code> module tracks commands used in all PowerShell sessions and writes them to a file (<code>$env:APPDATA\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\PSReadLine\ConsoleHost_history.txt</code> by default). Adversaries may change where these logs are saved using <code>Set-PSReadLineOption -HistorySavePath {File Path}</code>. This will cause <code>ConsoleHost_history.txt</code> to stop receiving logs. Additionally, it is possible to turn off logging to this file using the PowerShell command <code>Set-PSReadlineOption -HistorySaveStyle SaveNothing</code>.(Citation: Microsoft PowerShell Command History)(Citation: Sophos PowerShell command audit)(Citation: Sophos PowerShell Command History Forensics)

Adversaries may also leverage a [Network Device CLI](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/008) on network devices to disable historical command logging (e.g. <code>no logging</code>).</blockquote>

## Atomic Test #3 - Mac HISTCONTROL
The HISTCONTROL variable is set to ignore (not write to the history file) command that are a duplicate of something already in the history 
and commands that start with a space. This atomic sets this variable in the current session and also writes it to the current user's ~/.bash_profile 
so that it will apply to all future settings as well.

cp $HISTFILE $HISTFILE.OLD
if ((${#HISTFILE[@]})); then echo $HISTFILE; fi
echo "" > $HISTFILE
if [ $(wc -c <$HISTFILE) -gt 1 ]; then echo "$HISTFILE is larger than 1k"; fi
ls -la $HISTFILE 
cat $HISTFILE
history -c 
if [ $(history |wc -l) -eq 1 ]; then echo "History cache cleared"; fi

if [ "$HISTCONTROL" != "ignoreboth" ]; then export HISTCONTROL="ignoreboth"; fi
history -c 
ls -la $HISTFILE # " ls -la $HISTFILE"
if [ $(history |wc -l) -eq 1 ]; then echo "ls -la is not in history cache"; fi
# -> ls -la is not in history cache
if [ "$HISTCONTROL" != "erasedups" ]; then export HISTCONTROL="erasedups"; fi
history -c 
ls -la $HISTFILE
ls -la $HISTFILE
ls -la $HISTFILE

## Atomic Test #11 - Disable Windows Command Line Auditing using reg.exe
In Windows operating systems, command line auditing is controlled through the following registry value:

  Registry Path: HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System\Audit
  
  Registry Value: ProcessCreationIncludeCmdLine_Enabled

When command line auditing is enabled, the system records detailed information about command execution, including the command executed, the user account responsible for executing the command, and the timestamp of the execution.
This information is crucial for security monitoring and forensic analysis, as it helps organizations detect and investigate unauthorized or malicious activities within their systems.
By default, command line auditing may not be enabled in Windows systems, and administrators must manually configure the appropriate registry settings to activate it.
Conversely, attackers may attempt to tamper with these registry keys to disable command line auditing, as part of their efforts to evade detection and cover their tracks while perpetrating malicious activities.

Because this attack executes reg.exe using a command prompt, this attack can be detected by monitoring both:
  Process Creation events for reg.exe (Windows Event ID 4688, Sysmon Event ID 1)
  Registry events (Windows Event ID 4657, Sysmon Event ID 13)

## Atomic Test #12 - Disable Windows Command Line Auditing using Powershell Cmdlet
In Windows operating systems, command line auditing is controlled through the following registry value:

Conversely, attackers may attempt to tamper with these registry keys to disable command line auditing, as part of their efforts to evade detection and cover their tracks while perpetrating malicious activities.

Because this attack runs a Powershell cmdlet, this attack can be detected by monitoring both:
  Powershell Logging (Windows Powershell Event ID 400, 800, 4103, 4104)
