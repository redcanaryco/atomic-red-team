    The HISTCONTROL variable is set to ignore (not write to the history file) command that are a duplicate of something already in the history 
    and commands that start with a space. This atomic sets this variable in the current session and also writes it to the current user's ~/.bash_profile 
    so that it will apply to all future settings as well.
