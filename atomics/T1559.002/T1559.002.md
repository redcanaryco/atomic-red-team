# T1559.002 - Inter-Process Communication: Dynamic Data Exchange
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1559/002)
<blockquote>Adversaries may use Windows Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) to execute arbitrary commands. DDE is a client-server protocol for one-time and/or continuous inter-process communication (IPC) between applications. Once a link is established, applications can autonomously exchange transactions consisting of strings, warm data links (notifications when a data item changes), hot data links (duplications of changes to a data item), and requests for command execution.

Object Linking and Embedding (OLE), or the ability to link data between documents, was originally implemented through DDE. Despite being superseded by [Component Object Model](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1559/001), DDE may be enabled in Windows 10 and most of Microsoft Office 2016 via Registry keys.(Citation: BleepingComputer DDE Disabled in Word Dec 2017)(Citation: Microsoft ADV170021 Dec 2017)(Citation: Microsoft DDE Advisory Nov 2017)

Microsoft Office documents can be poisoned with DDE commands, directly or through embedded files, and used to deliver execution via [Phishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566) campaigns or hosted Web content, avoiding the use of Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macros.(Citation: SensePost PS DDE May 2016)(Citation: Kettle CSV DDE Aug 2014)(Citation: Enigma Reviving DDE Jan 2018)(Citation: SensePost MacroLess DDE Oct 2017) Similarly, adversaries may infect payloads to execute applications and/or commands on a victim device by way of embedding DDE formulas within a CSV file intended to be opened through a Windows spreadsheet program.(Citation: OWASP CSV Injection)(Citation: CSV Excel Macro Injection )

DDE could also be leveraged by an adversary operating on a compromised machine who does not have direct access to a [Command and Scripting Interpreter](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059). DDE execution can be invoked remotely via [Remote Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021) such as [Distributed Component Object Model](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/003) (DCOM).(Citation: Fireeye Hunting COM June 2019)</blockquote>

## Atomic Tests

- [Atomic Test #1 - Execute Commands](#atomic-test-1---execute-commands)

- [Atomic Test #2 - Execute PowerShell script via Word DDE](#atomic-test-2---execute-powershell-script-via-word-dde)

- [Atomic Test #3 - DDEAUTO](#atomic-test-3---ddeauto)


<br/>

## Atomic Test #1 - Execute Commands
Executes commands via DDE using Microsfot Word

**Supported Platforms:** Windows


**auto_generated_guid:** f592ba2a-e9e8-4d62-a459-ef63abd819fd





#### Run it with these steps! 
Open Microsoft Word

Insert tab -> Quick Parts -> Field

Choose = (Formula) and click ok.

After that, you should see a Field inserted in the document with an error "!Unexpected End of Formula", right-click the Field, and choose Toggle Field Codes.

The Field Code should now be displayed, change it to Contain the following:

{DDEAUTO c:\\windows\\system32\\cmd.exe "/k calc.exe"  }







<br/>
<br/>

## Atomic Test #2 - Execute PowerShell script via Word DDE
When the word document opens it will prompt the user to click ok on a dialogue box, then attempt to run PowerShell with DDEAUTO to download and execute a powershell script

**Supported Platforms:** Windows


**auto_generated_guid:** 47c21fb6-085e-4b0d-b4d2-26d72c3830b3






#### Attack Commands: Run with `command_prompt`! 


```cmd
start $PathToAtomicsFolder\T1559.002\bin\DDE_Document.docx
```
