# T1559.002 - Dynamic Data Exchange
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1559.002)
<blockquote>Adversaries may use Windows Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) to execute arbitrary commands. DDE is a client-server protocol for one-time and/or continuous inter-process communication (IPC) between applications. Once a link is established, applications can autonomously exchange transactions consisting of strings, warm data links (notifications when a data item changes), hot data links (duplications of changes to a data item), and requests for command execution.

Object Linking and Embedding (OLE), or the ability to link data between documents, was originally implemented through DDE. Despite being superseded by [Component Object Model](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1559/001), DDE may be enabled in Windows 10 and most of Microsoft Office 2016 via Registry keys. (Citation: BleepingComputer DDE Disabled in Word Dec 2017) (Citation: Microsoft ADV170021 Dec 2017) (Citation: Microsoft DDE Advisory Nov 2017)

Microsoft Office documents can be poisoned with DDE commands (Citation: SensePost PS DDE May 2016) (Citation: Kettle CSV DDE Aug 2014), directly or through embedded files (Citation: Enigma Reviving DDE Jan 2018), and used to deliver execution via [Phishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566) campaigns or hosted Web content, avoiding the use of Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macros. (Citation: SensePost MacroLess DDE Oct 2017) DDE could also be leveraged by an adversary operating on a compromised machine who does not have direct access to a [Command and Scripting Interpreter](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059).</blockquote>

- [Atomic Test #2 - Execute PowerShell script via Word DDE](#atomic-test-2---execute-powershell-script-via-word-dde)

- [Atomic Test #3 - DDEAUTO](#atomic-test-3---ddeauto)


<br/>

## Atomic Test #1 - Execute Commands
Executes commands via DDE using Microsfot Word

**Supported Platforms:** Windows




#### Run it with these steps! 
Open Microsoft Word

Insert tab -> Quick Parts -> Field

Choose = (Formula) and click ok.

After that, you should see a Field inserted in the document with an error "!Unexpected End of Formula", right-click the Field, and choose Toggle Field Codes.

The Field Code should now be displayed, change it to Contain the following:

{DDEAUTO c:\\windows\\system32\\cmd.exe "/k calc.exe"  }

<br/>

## Atomic Test #2 - Execute PowerShell script via Word DDE
When the word document opens it will prompt the user to click ok on a dialogue box, then attempt to run PowerShell with DDEAUTO to download and execute a powershell script

**Supported Platforms:** Windows





#### Attack Commands: Run with `command_prompt`! 


```cmd
start $PathToAtomicsFolder\T1559.002\bin\DDE_Document.docx
```
