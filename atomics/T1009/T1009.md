# T1009 - Binary Padding
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1009)
<blockquote>Some security tools inspect files with static signatures to determine if they are known malicious. Adversaries may add data to files to increase the size beyond what security tools are capable of handling or to change the file hash to avoid hash-based blacklists.

Detection: Depending on the method used to pad files, a file-based signature may be capable of detecting padding using a scanning or on-access based tool. 

When executed, the resulting process from padded files may also exhibit other behavior characteristics of being used to conduct an intrusion such as system and network information Discovery or Lateral Movement, which could be used as event indicators that point to the source file.

Platforms: Linux, macOS, Windows

Defense Bypassed: Anti-virus, Signature-based detection</blockquote>

## Atomic Test #1 - Pad Evil Binary to Change Hash
Copies cat to create an "evil binary" and pads it with a zero to change the hash without harming execution

**Supported Platforms:** macOS, Linux


#### Run it with `sh`!
```
cp /bin/cat /tmp/evilCat
md5sum /tmp/evilCat
dd if=/dev/zero bs=1 count=1 >> /tmp/evilCat
md5sum /tmp/evilCat
/tmp/evilCat .bash_profile
```
