# T1070 - Indicator Removal on Host
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1070)
<blockquote>Adversaries may delete or modify artifacts generated within systems to remove evidence of their presence or hinder defenses. Various artifacts may be created by an adversary or something that can be attributed to an adversaryâ€™s actions. Typically these artifacts are used as defensive indicators related to monitored events, such as strings from downloaded files, logs that are generated from user actions, and other data analyzed by defenders. Location, format, and type of artifact (such as command or login history) are often specific to each platform.

Removal of these indicators may interfere with event collection, reporting, or other processes used to detect intrusion activity. This may compromise the integrity of security solutions by causing notable events to go unreported. This activity may also impede forensic analysis and incident response, due to lack of sufficient data to determine what occurred.</blockquote>

## Atomic Test #1 - Indicator Removal using FSUtil
Manages the update sequence number (USN) change journal, which provides a persistent log of all changes made to files on the volume. Upon execution, no output
will be displayed. More information about fsutil can be found at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/fsutil-usn

**Supported Platforms:** Windows


**auto_generated_guid:** b4115c7a-0e92-47f0-a61e-17e7218b2435






#### Attack Commands: Run with `command_prompt`!  Elevation Required (e.g. root or admin) 


```cmd
fsutil usn deletejournal /D C:
```

#### Cleanup Commands:
```cmd
fsutil usn createjournal m=1000 a=100 c:
```

## Atomic Test #2 - Indicator Manipulation using FSUtil
Finds a file by user name (if Disk Quotas are enabled), queries allocated ranges for a file, sets a file's short name, sets a file's valid data length, sets zero data for a file, or creates a new file. Upon execution, no output
will be displayed. More information about fsutil can be found at https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/fsutil-file
