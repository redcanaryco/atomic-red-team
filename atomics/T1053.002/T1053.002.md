# T1053.002 - At (Windows)
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1053.002)
<blockquote>Adversaries may abuse the <code>at.exe</code> utility to perform task scheduling for initial or recurring execution of malicious code. The [at](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0110) utility exists as an executable within Windows for scheduling tasks at a specified time and date. Using [at](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0110) requires that the Task Scheduler service be running, and the user to be logged on as a member of the local Administrators group. 

An adversary may use <code>at.exe</code> in Windows environments to execute programs at system startup or on a scheduled basis for persistence. [at](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0110) can also be abused to conduct remote Execution as part of Lateral Movement and or to run a process under the context of a specified account (such as SYSTEM).

Note: The <code>at.exe</code> command line utility has been deprecated in current versions of Windows in favor of <code>schtasks</code>.</blockquote>
