# T1053.002 - Scheduled Task/Job: At
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053/002)
<blockquote>Adversaries may abuse the [at](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0110) utility to perform task scheduling for initial or recurring execution of malicious code. The [at](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0110) utility exists as an executable within Windows, Linux, and macOS for scheduling tasks at a specified time and date. Although deprecated in favor of [Scheduled Task](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053/005)'s [schtasks](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0111) in Windows environments, using [at](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0110) requires that the Task Scheduler service be running, and the user to be logged on as a member of the local Administrators group.

On Linux and macOS, [at](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0110) may be invoked by the superuser as well as any users added to the <code>at.allow</code> file. If the <code>at.allow</code> file does not exist, the <code>at.deny</code> file is checked. Every username not listed in <code>at.deny</code> is allowed to invoke [at](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0110). If the <code>at.deny</code> exists and is empty, global use of [at](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0110) is permitted. If neither file exists (which is often the baseline) only the superuser is allowed to use [at](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0110).(Citation: Linux at)

Adversaries may use [at](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0110) to execute programs at system startup or on a scheduled basis for [Persistence](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0003). [at](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0110) can also be abused to conduct remote [Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0002) as part of [Lateral Movement](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0008) and/or to run a process under the context of a specified account (such as SYSTEM).

In Linux environments, adversaries may also abuse [at](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0110) to break out of restricted environments by using a task to spawn an interactive system shell or to run system commands. Similarly, [at](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0110) may also be used for [Privilege Escalation](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0004) if the binary is allowed to run as superuser via <code>sudo</code>.(Citation: GTFObins at)</blockquote>

## Atomic Tests

- [Atomic Test #1 - At.exe Scheduled task](#atomic-test-1---atexe-scheduled-task)

- [Atomic Test #2 - At - Schedule a job](#atomic-test-2---at---schedule-a-job)


<br/>

## Atomic Test #1 - At.exe Scheduled task
Executes cmd.exe
Note: deprecated in Windows 8+

Upon successful execution, cmd.exe will spawn at.exe and create a scheduled task that will spawn cmd at a specific time.

**Supported Platforms:** Windows


**auto_generated_guid:** 4a6c0dc4-0f2a-4203-9298-a5a9bdc21ed8






#### Attack Commands: Run with `command_prompt`! 


```cmd
at 13:20 /interactive cmd
```






<br/>
<br/>

## Atomic Test #2 - At - Schedule a job
This test submits a command to be run in the future by the `at` daemon.

**Supported Platforms:** Linux


**auto_generated_guid:** 7266d898-ac82-4ec0-97c7-436075d0d08e





#### Inputs:
| Name | Description | Type | Default Value |
|------|-------------|------|---------------|
| time_spec | Time specification of when the command should run | string | now + 1 minute|
| at_command | The command to be run | string | echo Hello from Atomic Red Team|


#### Attack Commands: Run with `sh`! 


```sh
echo "#{at_command}" | at #{time_spec}
```




#### Dependencies:  Run with `sh`!
##### Description: The `at` and `atd` executables must exist in the PATH
##### Check Prereq Commands:
```sh
which at && which atd
```
##### Get Prereq Commands:
```sh
echo 'Please install `at` and `atd`; they were not found in the PATH (Package name: `at`)'
```
##### Description: The `atd` daemon must be running
##### Check Prereq Commands:
```sh
systemctl status atd || service atd status
```
##### Get Prereq Commands:
```sh
echo 'Please start the `atd` daemon (sysv: `service atd start` ; systemd: `systemctl start atd`)'
```
