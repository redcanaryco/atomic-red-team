# T1018 - Remote System Discovery
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1018)
<blockquote>Adversaries will likely attempt to get a listing of other systems by IP address, hostname, or other logical identifier on a network that may be used for Lateral Movement from the current system. Functionality could exist within remote access tools to enable this, but utilities available on the operating system could also be used. Adversaries may also use local host files in order to discover the hostname to IP address mappings of remote systems. 

### Windows

Examples of tools and commands that acquire this information include "ping" or "net view" using [Net](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0039). The contents of the <code>C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts</code> file can be viewed to gain insight into the existing hostname to IP mappings on the system.

### Mac

Specific to Mac, the <code>bonjour</code> protocol to discover additional Mac-based systems within the same broadcast domain. Utilities such as "ping" and others can be used to gather information about remote systems. The contents of the <code>/etc/hosts</code> file can be viewed to gain insight into existing hostname to IP mappings on the system.

### Linux

Utilities such as "ping" and others can be used to gather information about remote systems. The contents of the <code>/etc/hosts</code> file can be viewed to gain insight into existing hostname to IP mappings on the system.

### Cloud

In cloud environments, the above techniques may be used to discover remote systems depending upon the host operating system. In addition, cloud environments often provide APIs with information about remote systems and services.

$secondOctet = $pieces[1]
$thirdOctet = $pieces[2]
foreach ($ip in 1..255 | % { "$firstOctet.$secondOctet.$thirdOctet.$_" } ) {cmd.exe /c nslookup $ip}
```
