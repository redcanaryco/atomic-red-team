# T1070.001 - Indicator Removal on Host: Clear Windows Event Logs
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1070.001)
<blockquote>
Adversaries may clear Windows Event Logs to hide the activity of an intrusion. Windows Event Logs are a record of a computer's alerts and notifications. There are three system-defined sources of events: System, Application, and Security, with five event types: Error, Warning, Information, Success Audit, and Failure Audit.

The event logs can be cleared with the following utility commands:

    wevtutil cl system
    wevtutil cl application
    wevtutil cl security

These logs may also be cleared through other mechanisms, such as the event viewer GUI or PowerShell.
