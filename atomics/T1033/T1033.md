# T1033 - System Owner/User Discovery
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1033)
<blockquote>Adversaries may attempt to identify the primary user, currently logged in user, set of users that commonly uses a system, or whether a user is actively using the system. They may do this, for example, by retrieving account usernames or by using [OS Credential Dumping](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003). The information may be collected in a number of different ways using other Discovery techniques, because user and username details are prevalent throughout a system and include running process ownership, file/directory ownership, session information, and system logs. Adversaries may use the information from [System Owner/User Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1033) during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors, including whether or not the adversary fully infects the target and/or attempts specific actions.

Various utilities and commands may acquire this information, including <code>whoami</code>. In macOS and Linux, the currently logged in user can be identified with <code>w</code> and <code>who</code>. On macOS the <code>dscl . list /Users | grep -v '_'</code> command can also be used to enumerate user accounts. Environment variables, such as <code>%USERNAME%</code> and <code>$USER</code>, may also be used to access this information.

On network devices, [Network Device CLI](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/008) commands such as `show users` and `show ssh` can be used to display users currently logged into the device.(Citation: show_ssh_users_cmd_cisco)(Citation: US-CERT TA18-106A Network Infrastructure Devices 2018)</blockquote>

<br/>

## Atomic Test #1 - System Owner/User Discovery
Identify System owner or users on an endpoint.

Upon successful execution, cmd.exe will spawn multiple commands against a target host to identify usernames. Output will be via stdout. 
Additionally, two files will be written to disk - computers.txt and usernames.txt.

**Supported Platforms:** Windows


**auto_generated_guid:** 4c4959bf-addf-4b4a-be86-8d09cc1857aa





#### Inputs:
| Name | Description | Type | Default Value |
|------|-------------|------|---------------|
| computer_name | Name of remote computer | string | localhost|


#### Attack Commands: Run with `command_prompt`! 


```cmd
cmd.exe /C whoami
wmic useraccount get /ALL
quser /SERVER:"#{computer_name}"
quser
qwinsta.exe /server:#{computer_name}
qwinsta.exe
for /F "tokens=1,2" %i in ('qwinsta /server:#{computer_name} ^| findstr "Active Disc"') do @echo %i | find /v "#" | find /v "console" || echo %j > computers.txt
@FOR /F %n in (computers.txt) DO @FOR /F "tokens=1,2" %i in ('qwinsta /server:%n ^| findstr "Active Disc"') do @echo %i | find /v "#" | find /v "console" || echo %j > usernames.txt
```

## Atomic Test #6 - System Discovery - SocGholish whoami
SocGholish performs whoami discovery commands and outputs the results to a tmp file. 
The test will generate a filename similar to the random one generated during execution and write the file to AppData\Temp.
