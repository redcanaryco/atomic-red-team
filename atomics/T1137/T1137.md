# T1137 - Office Application Startup
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1137)
<blockquote>Adversaries may leverage Microsoft Office-based applications for persistence between startups. Microsoft Office is a fairly common application suite on Windows-based operating systems within an enterprise network. There are multiple mechanisms that can be used with Office for persistence when an Office-based application is started; this can include the use of Office Template Macros and add-ins.

A variety of features have been discovered in Outlook that can be abused to obtain persistence, such as Outlook rules, forms, macros and Home Page.(Citation: SensePost Ruler GitHub) These persistence mechanisms can work within Outlook or be used through Office 365.(Citation: TechNet O365 Outlook Rules)</blockquote>

## Atomic Test #1 - Office Application Startup - Outlook as a C2

As outlined in MDSEC's Blog post https://www.mdsec.co.uk/2020/11/a-fresh-outlook-on-mail-based-persistence/ 
it is possible to use Outlook Macro as a way to achieve persistance and execute arbitrary commands in the user context. This transform Outlook into a C2 execution method.
To achieve this two things must happen on the system:
- The macro security registry value must be set to '4'
- A correctly formatted file called VbaProject.OTM must be created in the Outlook Folder.

Note: There are a variety of options possible for the Macro security setting. These are:
```
4 = Disable all macros without notification
3 = Notifications for digitally signed macros, all other macros disabled
2 = Notifications for all macros
1 = Enable all Macros
```

**Supported Platforms:** Windows
