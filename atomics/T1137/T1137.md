# T1137 - Office Application Startup
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1137)
<blockquote>Adversaries may leverage Microsoft Office-based applications for persistence between startups. Microsoft Office is a fairly common application suite on Windows-based operating systems within an enterprise network. There are multiple mechanisms that can be used with Office for persistence when an Office-based application is started; this can include the use of Office Template Macros and add-ins.

A variety of features have been discovered in Outlook that can be abused to obtain persistence, such as Outlook rules, forms, and Home Page.(Citation: SensePost Ruler GitHub) These persistence mechanisms can work within Outlook or be used through Office 365.(Citation: TechNet O365 Outlook Rules)</blockquote>

## Atomic Test #1 - Office Application Startup - Outlook as a C2
As outlined in MDSEC's Blog post https://www.mdsec.co.uk/2020/11/a-fresh-outlook-on-mail-based-persistence/ 
it is possible to use Outlook Macro as a way to achieve persistance and execute arbitrary commands. This transform Outlook into a C2.
Too achieve this two things must happened on the syste
- The macro security registry value must be set to '4'
- A file called VbaProject.OTM must be created in the Outlook Folder.

**Supported Platforms:** Windows
