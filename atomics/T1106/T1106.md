# T1106 - Native API
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1106)
<blockquote>Adversaries may interact with the native Windows application programming interface (API) to execute behaviors. Similar to the system call interface on UNIX systems, the Windows native API provides a controlled means to calling low-level OS services within the kernel, such as those involving hardware/devices, memory, and processes. The native API is leveraged by the OS during system boot (when other system components are not yet initialized) but is also exposed to user-mode applications via ntdll.dll and ntoskrnl.exe.(Citation: Microsoft NativeAPI)

Functionality provided by the native API is also available via the Windows API, which provides a documented programming interface. For example, functions such as the Windows API <code>CreateProcess</code> will allow programs and scripts to start other processes with proper path and argument parameters.(Citation: Microsoft CreateProcess) This allows API callers to execute a binary, run a CLI command, load modules, etc. Thousands of similar API functions exist for various system operations.(Citation: Microsoft Win32)

Other software frameworks, such as Microsoft .NET, are also available to interact with the native API. These frameworks typically provide wrappers/abstractions to API functionalities and are designed for ease-of-use/portability of code.(Citation: Microsoft NET)

Adversaries may abuse the native API as a means of execution. Similar to [Command and Scripting Interpreter](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059), the native API, and its hierarchy of interfaces, provide mechanisms to interact with and utilize a victimized system. </blockquote>

## Atomic Tests
