# T1007 - System Service Discovery
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1007)
<blockquote>Adversaries may try to get information about registered services. Commands that may obtain information about services using operating system utilities are "sc," "tasklist /svc" using [Tasklist](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0057), and "net start" using [Net](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0039), but adversaries may also use other tools as well. Adversaries may use the information from [System Service Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1007) during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors, including whether or not the adversary fully infects the target and/or attempts specific actions.</blockquote>

## Atomic Tests

- [Atomic Test #1 - System Service Discovery](#atomic-test-1---system-service-discovery)

- [Atomic Test #2 - System Service Discovery - net.exe](#atomic-test-2---system-service-discovery---netexe)


<br/>

## Atomic Test #1 - System Service Discovery
Identify system services

**Supported Platforms:** Windows


#### Inputs
| Name | Description | Type | Default Value | 
|------|-------------|------|---------------|
| service_name | Name of service to start stop, query | string | svchost.exe|

#### Run it with `command_prompt`!  Elevation Required (e.g. root or admin) 
```
tasklist.exe
sc query
sc query state= all
sc start #{service_name}
sc stop #{service_name}
wmic service where (displayname like "#{service_name}") get name
```

## Atomic Test #2 - System Service Discovery - net.exe
Enumerates started system services using net.exe and writes them to a file. This technique has been used by multiple threat actors.

**Supported Platforms:** Windows


#### Inputs
| Name | Description | Type | Default Value | 
|------|-------------|------|---------------|
| output_file | Path of file to hold net.exe output | Path | C:\Windows\Temp\service-list.txt|

#### Run it with `command_prompt`! 
```
net.exe start >> #{output_file}
```
