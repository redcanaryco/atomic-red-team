# T1007 - System Service Discovery
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1007)
<blockquote>Adversaries may try to gather information about registered local system services. Adversaries may obtain information about services using tools as well as OS utility commands such as <code>sc query</code>, <code>tasklist /svc</code>, <code>systemctl --type=service</code>, and <code>net start</code>.

Adversaries may use the information from [System Service Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1007) during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors, including whether or not the adversary fully infects the target and/or attempts specific actions.</blockquote>

## Atomic Tests

- [Atomic Test #1 - System Service Discovery](#atomic-test-1---system-service-discovery)

- [Atomic Test #2 - System Service Discovery - net.exe](#atomic-test-2---system-service-discovery---netexe)

- [Atomic Test #3 - System Service Discovery - systemctl](#atomic-test-3---system-service-discovery---systemctl)


<br/>

## Atomic Test #1 - System Service Discovery
Identify system services.

Upon successful execution, cmd.exe will execute service commands with expected result to stdout.

**Supported Platforms:** Windows


**auto_generated_guid:** 89676ba1-b1f8-47ee-b940-2e1a113ebc71






#### Attack Commands: Run with `command_prompt`!  Elevation Required (e.g. root or admin) 


```cmd
tasklist.exe
sc query
sc query state= all
```






<br/>
<br/>

## Atomic Test #2 - System Service Discovery - net.exe
Enumerates started system services using net.exe and writes them to a file. This technique has been used by multiple threat actors.

Upon successful execution, net.exe will run from cmd.exe that queries services. Expected output is to a txt file in in the temp directory called service-list.txt.

**Supported Platforms:** Windows


**auto_generated_guid:** 5f864a3f-8ce9-45c0-812c-bdf7d8aeacc3





#### Inputs:
| Name | Description | Type | Default Value |
|------|-------------|------|---------------|
| output_file | Path of file to hold net.exe output | Path | %temp%&#92;service-list.txt|


#### Attack Commands: Run with `command_prompt`! 


```cmd
net.exe start >> #{output_file}
```

#### Cleanup Commands:
```cmd
del /f /q /s #{output_file} >nul 2>&1
```





<br/>
<br/>

## Atomic Test #3 - System Service Discovery - systemctl
Enumerates system service using systemctl

**Supported Platforms:** Linux


**auto_generated_guid:** f4b26bce-4c2c-46c0-bcc5-fce062d38bef






#### Attack Commands: Run with `bash`! 


```bash
systemctl --type=service
```
