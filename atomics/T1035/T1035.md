# T1035 - Service Execution
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1035)
<blockquote>Adversaries may execute a binary, command, or script via a method that interacts with Windows services, such as the Service Control Manager. This can be done by either creating a new service or modifying an existing service. This technique is the execution used in conjunction with [New Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1050) and [Modify Existing Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1031) during service persistence or privilege escalation.</blockquote>

## Atomic Tests

- [Atomic Test #1 - Execute a Command as a Service](#atomic-test-1---execute-a-command-as-a-service)


<br/>

## Atomic Test #1 - Execute a Command as a Service
Creates a service specifying an aribrary command and executes it. When executing commands such as PowerShell, the service will report that it did not start correctly even when code executes properly. 

**Supported Platforms:** Windows


#### Inputs
| Name | Description | Type | Default Value | 
|------|-------------|------|---------------|
| service_name | Name of service to create | string | ARTService|
| executable_command | Command to execute as a service | string | %COMSPEC% /c powershell.exe -nop -w hidden -command New-Item -ItemType File C:rt-marker.txt|

#### Run it with `command_prompt`!
```
sc.exe create #{service_name} binPath= #{executable_command}
sc.exe start #{service_name}
sc.exe delete #{service_name}
```
<br/>
## Atomic Test #1 - Execute a Application as a Service
Every application is not service-aware and services will stop soon as it starts. Using srvany.exe part of windows tool kit we can start up our program in the process. Run all commands in elevated PowerShell prompt.
Copy srvany.exe and application you want to execute in same folder

**Supported Platforms:** Windows


#### Inputs
| Name | Description | Type | Default Value | 
|------|-------------|------|---------------|
| service_name | Name of service to create | string | ARTService|
| executable_command | Command to execute as a service | string | C:\Test\srvany.exe|
| Registry | Application to execute as a service | string | HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\#{service_name}\Parameters |
#### Run it with `command_prompt`!
```
sc.exe create #{service_name} binPath= #{executable_command}
reg add HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\#{service_name}\Parameters /v Application /d #{path_to_executable}
sc.exe start #{service_name}
sc.exe delete #{service_name}
