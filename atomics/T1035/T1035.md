# T1035 - Service Execution
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1035)
<blockquote>Adversaries may execute a binary, command, or script via a method that interacts with Windows services, such as the Service Control Manager. This can be done by either creating a new service or modifying an existing service. This technique is the execution used in conjunction with [New Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1050) and [Modify Existing Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1031) during service persistence or privilege escalation.</blockquote>
