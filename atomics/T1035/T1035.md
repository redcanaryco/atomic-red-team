# T1035 - Service Execution
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1035)
<blockquote>Adversaries may execute a binary, command, or script via a method that interacts with Windows services, such as the Service Control Manager. This can be done by either creating a new service or modifying an existing service. This technique is the execution used in conjunction with [New Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1050) and [Modify Existing Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1031) during service persistence or privilege escalation.</blockquote>

## Atomic Tests

- [Atomic Test #1 - Execute a Command as a Service](#atomic-test-1---execute-a-command-as-a-service)

- [Atomic Test #2 - Use PsExec to execute a command on a remote host](#atomic-test-2---use-psexec-to-execute-a-command-on-a-remote-host)


<br/>

## Atomic Test #1 - Execute a Command as a Service
Creates a service specifying an aribrary command and executes it. When executing commands such as PowerShell, the service will report that it did not start correctly even when code executes properly.

**Supported Platforms:** Windows


#### Inputs:
| Name | Description | Type | Default Value | 
|------|-------------|------|---------------|
| service_name | Name of service to create | string | ARTService|
| executable_command | Command to execute as a service | string | %COMSPEC% /c powershell.exe -nop -w hidden -command New-Item -ItemType File C:\art-marker.txt|


#### Attack Commands: Run with `command_prompt`!  Elevation Required (e.g. root or admin) 
```
sc.exe create #{service_name} binPath= #{executable_command}
sc.exe start #{service_name}
sc.exe delete #{service_name}
```

## Atomic Test #2 - Use PsExec to execute a command on a remote host
Requires having Sysinternals installed, path to sysinternals is one of the input input_arguments
Will run a command on a remote host

**Supported Platforms:** Windows


#### Inputs:
| Name | Description | Type | Default Value | 
|------|-------------|------|---------------|
| psexec_exe | Path to PsExec | string | C:\PSTools\PsExec.exe|
| remote_host | Remote hostname or IP address | string | localhost|


#### Attack Commands: Run with `powershell`! 
```
#{psexec_exe} \\#{remote_host} "C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe"
```



#### Dependencies:  Run with `powershell`!
##### Description: PsExec tool from Sysinternals must exist on disk at specified location (#{psexec_exe})
##### Check Prereq Commands:
```
if (Test-Path "#{psexec_exe}"") { exit 0} else { exit 1} 
```
##### Get Prereq Commands:
```
Invoke-WebRequest "https://download.sysinternals.com/files/PSTools.zip" -OutFile "$env:TEMP\PsTools.zip"
Expand-Archive $env:TEMP\PsTools.zip $env:TEMP\PsTools -Force
New-Item -ItemType Directory ("#{psexec_exe}") -Force | Out-Null
Copy-Item $env:TEMP\PsTools\PsExec.exe "#{psexec_exe}" -Force
```
