# T1050 - New Service
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1050)
<blockquote>When operating systems boot up, they can start programs or applications called services that perform background system functions. (Citation: TechNet Services) A service's configuration information, including the file path to the service's executable, is stored in the Windows Registry. 

Adversaries may install a new service that can be configured to execute at startup by using utilities to interact with services or by directly modifying the Registry. The service name may be disguised by using a name from a related operating system or benign software with [Masquerading](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036). Services may be created with administrator privileges but are executed under SYSTEM privileges, so an adversary may also use a service to escalate privileges from administrator to SYSTEM. Adversaries may also directly start services through [Service Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1035).</blockquote>

## Atomic Tests

- [Atomic Test #1 - Service Installation](#atomic-test-1---service-installation)

- [Atomic Test #2 - Service Installation PowerShell](#atomic-test-2---service-installation-powershell)


<br/>

## Atomic Test #1 - Service Installation
Installs A Local Service.

Upon successful execution, powershell will download `AtomicService.exe` from github. cmd.exe will spawn sc.exe which will create and start the service. Results will output via stdout.

**Supported Platforms:** Windows




#### Inputs:
| Name | Description | Type | Default Value | 
|------|-------------|------|---------------|
| binary_path | Name of the service binary, include path. | Path | PathToAtomicsFolder&#92;T1050&#92;bin&#92;AtomicService.exe|
| service_name | Name of the Service | String | AtomicTestService|


#### Attack Commands: Run with `command_prompt`!  Elevation Required (e.g. root or admin) 


```cmd
sc.exe create #{service_name} binPath= #{binary_path}
sc.exe start #{service_name}
```

#### Cleanup Commands:
```cmd
sc.exe stop #{service_name}
sc.exe delete #{service_name}
```



#### Dependencies:  Run with `powershell`!
##### Description: Service binary must exist on disk at specified location (#{binary_path})
##### Check Prereq Commands:
```powershell
if (Test-Path #{binary_path}) {exit 0} else {exit 1} 
```
##### Get Prereq Commands:
```powershell
New-Item -Type Directory (split-path #{binary_path}) -ErrorAction ignore | Out-Null
Invoke-WebRequest "https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/raw/master/atomics/T1050/bin/AtomicService.exe" -OutFile "#{binary_path}"
```

## Atomic Test #2 - Service Installation PowerShell
Installs A Local Service via PowerShell.

Upon successful execution, powershell will download `AtomicService.exe` from github. Powershell will then use `New-Service` and `Start-Service` to start service. Results will output via stdout.

**Supported Platforms:** Windows




#### Inputs:
| Name | Description | Type | Default Value | 
|------|-------------|------|---------------|
| binary_path | Name of the service binary, include path. | Path | PathToAtomicsFolder&#92;T1050&#92;bin&#92;AtomicService.exe|
| service_name | Name of the Service | String | AtomicTestService|


#### Attack Commands: Run with `powershell`!  Elevation Required (e.g. root or admin) 


```powershell
New-Service -Name "#{service_name}" -BinaryPathName "#{binary_path}" 2>&1 | Out-Null
Start-Service -Name "#{service_name}"
```

#### Cleanup Commands:
```powershell
Stop-Service -Name "#{service_name}" 2>&1 | Out-Null
try {(Get-WmiObject Win32_Service -filter "name='#{service_name}'").Delete()}
catch {}
```



#### Dependencies:  Run with `powershell`!
##### Description: Service binary must exist on disk at specified location (#{binary_path})
##### Check Prereq Commands:
```powershell
if (Test-Path #{binary_path}) {exit 0} else {exit 1} 
```
##### Get Prereq Commands:
```powershell
New-Item -Type Directory (split-path #{binary_path}) -ErrorAction ignore | Out-Null
Invoke-WebRequest "https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/raw/master/atomics/T1050/bin/AtomicService.exe" -OutFile "#{binary_path}"
```
