# T1098.001 - Account Manipulation: Additional Cloud Credentials
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1098/001)
<blockquote>Adversaries may add adversary-controlled credentials to a cloud account to maintain persistent access to victim accounts and instances within the environment.

For example, adversaries may add credentials for Service Principals and Applications in addition to existing legitimate credentials in Azure AD.(Citation: Microsoft SolarWinds Customer Guidance)(Citation: Blue Cloud of Death)(Citation: Blue Cloud of Death Video) These credentials include both x509 keys and passwords.(Citation: Microsoft SolarWinds Customer Guidance) With sufficient permissions, there are a variety of ways to add credentials including the Azure Portal, Azure command line interface, and Azure or Az PowerShell modules.(Citation: Demystifying Azure AD Service Principals)

In infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) environments, after gaining access through [Cloud Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/004), adversaries may generate or import their own SSH keys using either the <code>CreateKeyPair</code> or <code>ImportKeyPair</code> API in AWS or the <code>gcloud compute os-login ssh-keys add</code> command in GCP.(Citation: GCP SSH Key Add) This allows persistent access to instances within the cloud environment without further usage of the compromised cloud accounts.(Citation: Expel IO Evil in AWS)(Citation: Expel Behind the Scenes)

Adversaries may also use the <code>CreateAccessKey</code> API in AWS or the <code>gcloud iam service-accounts keys create</code> command in GCP to add access keys to an account. If the target account has different permissions from the requesting account, the adversary may also be able to escalate their privileges in the environment (i.e. [Cloud Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/004)).(Citation: Rhino Security Labs AWS Privilege Escalation)(Citation: Sysdig ScarletEel 2.0) For example, in Azure AD environments, an adversary with the Application Administrator role can add a new set of credentials to their application's service principal. In doing so the adversary would be able to access the service principal’s roles and permissions, which may be different from those of the Application Administrator.(Citation: SpecterOps Azure Privilege Escalation) 

In AWS environments, adversaries with the appropriate permissions may also use the `sts:GetFederationToken` API call to create a temporary set of credentials to [Forge Web Credentials](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1606) tied to the permissions of the original user account. These temporary credentials may remain valid for the duration of their lifetime even if the original account’s API credentials are deactivated.

## Atomic Tests

- [Atomic Test #1 - Azure AD Application Hijacking - Service Principal](#atomic-test-1---azure-ad-application-hijacking---service-principal)

- [Atomic Test #2 - Azure AD Application Hijacking - App Registration](#atomic-test-2---azure-ad-application-hijacking---app-registration)

- [Atomic Test #3 - AWS - Create Access Key and Secret Key](#atomic-test-3---aws---create-access-key-and-secret-key)


<br/>

## Atomic Test #1 - Azure AD Application Hijacking - Service Principal
Add a certificate to an Application through its Service Principal. The certificate can then be used to authenticate as the application.
This can be used for persistence, and also for privilege escalation by benefiting from the Application's rights.
An account with high-enough Azure AD privileges is needed, such as Global Administrator or Application Administrator. The account authentication must be without MFA.

#### Attack Commands: Run with `powershell`!

# in the context of an ART test (and not a real attack), we don't need to keep access for too long. In case the cleanup command isn't called, it's better to ensure that everything expires after 1 day so it doesn't leave this backdoor open for too long
