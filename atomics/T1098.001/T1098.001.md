# T1098.001 - Additional Cloud Credentials
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1098/001)
<blockquote>Adversaries may add adversary-controlled credentials to a cloud account to maintain persistent access to victim accounts and instances within the environment.

Adversaries may add credentials for Service Principals and Applications in addition to existing legitimate credentials in Azure AD.(Citation: Microsoft SolarWinds Customer Guidance)(Citation: Blue Cloud of Death)(Citation: Blue Cloud of Death Video) These credentials include both x509 keys and passwords.(Citation: Microsoft SolarWinds Customer Guidance) With sufficient permissions, there are a variety of ways to add credentials including the Azure Portal, Azure command line interface, and Azure or Az PowerShell modules.(Citation: Demystifying Azure AD Service Principals)

In infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) environments, after gaining access through [Cloud Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/004), adversaries may generate or import their own SSH keys using either the <code>CreateKeyPair</code> or <code>ImportKeyPair</code> API in AWS or the <code>gcloud compute os-login ssh-keys add</code> command in GCP.(Citation: GCP SSH Key Add) This allows persistent access to instances within the cloud environment without further usage of the compromised cloud accounts.(Citation: Expel IO Evil in AWS)(Citation: Expel Behind the Scenes)</blockquote>

## Atomic Tests

- [Atomic Test #1 - AWS - Create Access Key and Secret Key](#atomic-test-1---aws---create-access-key-and-secret-key)


<br/>

## Atomic Test #1 - AWS - Create Access Key and Secret Key
Adversaries create their own new access and secret keys to programatically interact with AWS environment, which is already compromised

**Supported Platforms:** Iaas:aws


**auto_generated_guid:** 8822c3b0-d9f9-4daf-a043-491160a31122





#### Inputs:
| Name | Description | Type | Default Value |
|------|-------------|------|---------------|
| username | Create new AWS access and secret keys for the user | String | atomicredteam|


#### Attack Commands: Run with `sh`! 


```sh
aws iam create-access-key --user-name #{username} > $PathToAtomicsFolder/T1098.001/bin/aws_secret.creds
cd $PathToAtomicsFolder/T1098.001/bin/
./aws_secret.sh
```

#### Cleanup Commands:
```sh
access_key=`cat $PathToAtomicsFolder/T1098.001/bin/aws_secret.creds| jq -r '.AccessKey.AccessKeyId'`
aws iam delete-access-key --access-key-id $access_key --user-name #{username}
rm $PathToAtomicsFolder/T1098.001/bin/aws_secret.creds
```



#### Dependencies:  Run with `sh`!
##### Description: Check if the user exists.
##### Check Prereq Commands:
```sh
aws iam list-users | grep #{username}
```
##### Get Prereq Commands:
```sh
echo Please run atomic test T1136.003, before running this atomic
```
