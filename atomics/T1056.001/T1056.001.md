# T1056.001 - Keylogging
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1056.001)
<blockquote>Adversaries may log user keystrokes to intercept credentials as the user types them. Keylogging is likely to be used to acquire credentials for new access opportunities when [OS Credential Dumping](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003) efforts are not effective, and may require an adversary to intercept keystrokes on a system for a substantial period of time before credentials can be successfully captured.

Keylogging is the most prevalent type of input capture, with many different ways of intercepting keystrokes.(Citation: Adventures of a Keystroke) Some methods include:

* Hooking API callbacks used for processing keystrokes. Unlike [Credential API Hooking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1056/004), this focuses solely on API functions intended for processing keystroke data.
* Reading raw keystroke data from the hardware buffer.
* Windows Registry modifications.
* Custom drivers.</blockquote>

## Atomic Tests

- [Atomic Test #1 - Input Capture](#atomic-test-1---input-capture)


<br/>

## Atomic Test #1 - Input Capture
Utilize PowerShell and external resource to capture keystrokes
[Payload](https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/blob/master/atomics/T1056.001/src/Get-Keystrokes.ps1)
Provided by [PowerSploit](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/blob/master/Exfiltration/Get-Keystrokes.ps1)

Upon successful execution, Powershell will execute `Get-Keystrokes.ps1` and output to key.log.

**Supported Platforms:** Windows




#### Inputs:
| Name | Description | Type | Default Value | 
|------|-------------|------|---------------|
| filepath | Name of the local file, include path. | Path | $env:TEMP&#92;key.log|


#### Attack Commands: Run with `powershell`!  Elevation Required (e.g. root or admin) 


```powershell
Set-Location $PathToAtomicsFolder
.\T1056.001\src\Get-Keystrokes.ps1 -LogPath #{filepath}
```

#### Cleanup Commands:
```powershell
Remove-Item $env:TEMP\key.log -ErrorAction Ignore
```
