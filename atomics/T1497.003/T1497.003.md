# T1497.003 - Time Based Evasion
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1497/003)
<blockquote>Adversaries may employ various time-based methods to detect and avoid virtualization and analysis environments. This may include enumerating time-based properties, such as uptime or the system clock, as well as the use of timers or other triggers to avoid a virtual machine environment (VME) or sandbox, specifically those that are automated or only operate for a limited amount of time.

Adversaries may employ various time-based evasions, such as delaying malware functionality upon initial execution using programmatic sleep commands or native system scheduling functionality (ex: [Scheduled Task/Job](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053)). Delays may also be based on waiting for specific victim conditions to be met (ex: system time, events, etc.) or employ scheduled [Multi-Stage Channels](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1104) to avoid analysis and scrutiny.(Citation: Deloitte Environment Awareness)

Benign commands or other operations may also be used to delay malware execution. Loops or otherwise needless repetitions of commands, such as [Ping](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0097)s, may be used to delay malware execution and potentially exceed time thresholds of automated analysis environments.(Citation: Revil Independence Day)(Citation: Netskope Nitol) Another variation, commonly referred to as API hammering, involves making various calls to [Native API](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1106) functions in order to delay execution (while also potentially overloading analysis environments with junk data).(Citation: Joe Sec Nymaim)(Citation: Joe Sec Trickbot)

Adversaries may also use time as a metric to detect sandboxes and analysis environments, particularly those that attempt to manipulate time mechanisms to simulate longer elapses of time. For example, an adversary may be able to identify a sandbox accelerating time by sampling and calculating the expected value for an environment's timestamp before and after execution of a sleep function.(Citation: ISACA Malware Tricks)</blockquote>

## Atomic Tests

- [Atomic Test #1 - Delay execution with ping](#atomic-test-1---delay-execution-with-ping)


<br/>

## Atomic Test #1 - Delay execution with ping
Uses the ping command to introduce a delay before executing a malicious payload.

**Supported Platforms:** Linux, macOS


**auto_generated_guid:** 8b87dd03-8204-478c-bac3-3959f6528de3





#### Inputs:
| Name | Description | Type | Default Value |
|------|-------------|------|---------------|
| evil_command | Command to run after the delay | string | whoami|
| ping_count | Number of ping requests to send (higher counts increase the delay) | integer | 250|


#### Attack Commands: Run with `sh`! 


```sh
ping -c #{ping_count} 8.8.8.8 > /dev/null
#{evil_command}
```
