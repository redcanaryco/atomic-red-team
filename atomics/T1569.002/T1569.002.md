# T1569.002 - Service Execution
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1569/002)
<blockquote>Adversaries may abuse the Windows service control manager to execute malicious commands or payloads. The Windows service control manager (<code>services.exe</code>) is an interface to manage and manipulate services.(Citation: Microsoft Service Control Manager) The service control manager is accessible to users via GUI components as well as system utilities such as <code>sc.exe</code> and [Net](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0039).

[PsExec](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0029) can also be used to execute commands or payloads via a temporary Windows service created through the service control manager API.(Citation: Russinovich Sysinternals)

Adversaries may leverage these mechanisms to execute malicious content. This can be done by either executing a new or modified service. This technique is the execution used in conjunction with [Windows Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/003) during service persistence or privilege escalation.</blockquote>

## Atomic Tests

- [Atomic Test #1 - Execute a Command as a Service](#atomic-test-1---execute-a-command-as-a-service)

- [Atomic Test #2 - Use PsExec to execute a command on a remote host](#atomic-test-2---use-psexec-to-execute-a-command-on-a-remote-host)


<br/>

## Atomic Test #1 - Execute a Command as a Service
Creates a service specifying an aribrary command and executes it. When executing commands such as PowerShell, the service will report that it did not start correctly even when code executes properly.

Upon successful execution, cmd.exe create a new service using sc.exe create that will start powershell.exe to create a new file `art-marker.txt`

**Supported Platforms:** Windows


**auto_generated_guid:** 2382dee2-a75f-49aa-9378-f52df6ed3fb1





#### Inputs:
| Name | Description | Type | Default Value |
|------|-------------|------|---------------|
| service_name | Name of service to create | string | ARTService|
| executable_command | Command to execute as a service | string | %COMSPEC% /c powershell.exe -nop -w hidden -command New-Item -ItemType File C:&#92;art-marker.txt|


#### Attack Commands: Run with `command_prompt`!  Elevation Required (e.g. root or admin) 


```cmd
sc.exe create #{service_name} binPath= "#{executable_command}"
sc.exe start #{service_name}
sc.exe delete #{service_name}
```

#### Cleanup Commands:
```cmd
del C:\art-marker.txt >nul 2>&1
```

## Atomic Test #2 - Use PsExec to execute a command on a remote host
Requires having Sysinternals installed, path to sysinternals is one of the input input_arguments
Will start a process on a remote host.

Upon successful execution, cmd will utilize psexec.exe to spawn calc.exe on a remote endpoint (default:localhost).

**Supported Platforms:** Windows


**auto_generated_guid:** 873106b7-cfed-454b-8680-fa9f6400431c





#### Inputs:
| Name | Description | Type | Default Value |
|------|-------------|------|---------------|
| remote_host | Remote hostname or IP address | string | localhost|
| user_name | Username | String | DOMAIN&#92;Administrator|
| password | Password | String | P@ssw0rd1|
| psexec_exe | Path to PsExec | string | C:&#92;PSTools&#92;PsExec.exe|


#### Attack Commands: Run with `command_prompt`! 


```cmd
#{psexec_exe} \\#{remote_host} -u #{user_name} -p #{password} -accepteula "C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe"
```




#### Dependencies:  Run with `powershell`!
##### Description: PsExec tool from Sysinternals must exist on disk at specified location (#{psexec_exe})
##### Check Prereq Commands:
```powershell
if (Test-Path "#{psexec_exe}") { exit 0} else { exit 1}
```
##### Get Prereq Commands:
```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest "https://download.sysinternals.com/files/PSTools.zip" -OutFile "$env:TEMP\PsTools.zip"
Expand-Archive $env:TEMP\PsTools.zip $env:TEMP\PsTools -Force
New-Item -ItemType Directory (Split-Path "#{psexec_exe}") -Force | Out-Null
Copy-Item $env:TEMP\PsTools\PsExec.exe "#{psexec_exe}" -Force
```
