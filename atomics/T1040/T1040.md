# T1040 - Network Sniffing
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1040)
<blockquote>Network sniffing refers to using the network interface on a system to monitor or capture information sent over a wired or wireless connection. An adversary may place a network interface into promiscuous mode to passively access data in transit over the network, or use span ports to capture a larger amount of data.

Data captured via this technique may include user credentials, especially those sent over an insecure, unencrypted protocol. Techniques for name service resolution poisoning, such as [LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1171), can also be used to capture credentials to websites, proxies, and internal systems by redirecting traffic to an adversary.

Network sniffing may also reveal configuration details, such as running services, version numbers, and other network characteristics (ex: IP addressing, hostnames, VLAN IDs) necessary for follow-on Lateral Movement and/or Defense Evasion activities.</blockquote>

<br/>

## Atomic Test #1 - Packet Capture Linux
Perform a PCAP. Wireshark will be required for tshark. TCPdump may already be installed.

**Supported Platforms:** Linux


#### Inputs
| Name | Description | Type | Default Value | 
|------|-------------|------|---------------|
| interface | Specify interface to perform PCAP on. | String | ens33|

#### Run it with `bash`!
```
tcpdump -c 5 -nnni #{interface}
tshark -c 5 -i #{interface}
```
<br/>
<br/>

## Atomic Test #2 - Packet Capture MacOS
Perform a PCAP on MacOS. This will require Wireshark/tshark to be installed. TCPdump may already be installed.

**Supported Platforms:** macOS


#### Inputs
| Name | Description | Type | Default Value | 
|------|-------------|------|---------------|
| interface | Specify interface to perform PCAP on. | String | en0A|

#### Run it with `bash`!
```
tcpdump -c 5 -nnni #{interface}
tshark -c 5 -i #{interface}
```
<br/>
<br/>

## Atomic Test #3 - Packet Capture Windows Command Prompt
Perform a packet capture using the windows command prompt. This will require a host that has Wireshark/Tshark
installed, along with WinPCAP. Windump will require the windump executable.

**Supported Platforms:** Windows


#### Inputs
| Name | Description | Type | Default Value | 
|------|-------------|------|---------------|
| interface | Specify interface to perform PCAP on. | String | Ethernet0|

#### Run it with `command_prompt`!
```
c:\Program Files\Wireshark\tshark.exe -i #{interface} -c 5
c:\windump.exe
```
<br/>
<br/>

## Atomic Test #4 - Packet Capture PowerShell
Perform a packet capture using PowerShell with windump or tshark. This will require a host that has Wireshark/Tshark
installed, along with WinPCAP. Windump will require the windump executable.

**Supported Platforms:** Windows


#### Inputs
| Name | Description | Type | Default Value | 
|------|-------------|------|---------------|
| interface | Specify interface to perform PCAP on. | String | Ethernet0|

#### Run it with `powershell`!
```
c:\Program Files\Wireshark\tshark.exe -i #{interface} -c 5
c:\windump.exe
```
