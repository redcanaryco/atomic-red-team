# T1609 - Kubernetes Exec Into Container
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1609)
<blockquote>Adversaries may abuse a container administration service to execute commands within a container. A container administration service such as the Docker daemon, the Kubernetes API server, or the kubelet may allow remote management of containers within an environment.(Citation: Docker Daemon CLI)(Citation: Kubernetes API)(Citation: Kubernetes Kubelet)

In Docker, adversaries may specify an entrypoint during container deployment that executes a script or command, or they may use a command such as <code>docker exec</code> to execute a command within a running container.(Citation: Docker Entrypoint)(Citation: Docker Exec) In Kubernetes, if an adversary has sufficient permissions, they may gain remote execution in a container in the cluster via interaction with the Kubernetes API server, the kubelet, or by running a command such as <code>kubectl exec</code>.(Citation: Kubectl Exec Get Shell)</blockquote>

## Atomic Tests

- [Atomic Test #1 - ExecIntoContainer](#atomic-test-1---execintocontainer)


<br/>

## Atomic Test #1 - ExecIntoContainer
Attackers who have permissions, can run malicious commands in containers in the cluster using exec command (“kubectl exec”). In this method, attackers can use legitimate images, such as an OS image (e.g., Ubuntu) as a backdoor container, and run their malicious code remotely by using “kubectl exec”.

**Supported Platforms:** Containers

#### Inputs:
| Name | Description | Type | Default Value |
|------|-------------|------|---------------|
| namespace | K8s namespace to use | String | default|
| command | Command to run | String | uname|


#### Attack Commands: Run with `bash`! 


```bash
kubectl create -f src/busybox.yaml -n #{namespace}
kubectl exec -n #{namespace} busybox -- #{command}
```

#### Cleanup Commands:
```bash
kubectl delete pod busybox -n #{namespace}
```



#### Dependencies:  Run with `bash`!
##### Description: kubectl must be installed
##### Check Prereq Commands:
```bash
which kubectl
```
##### Get Prereq Commands:
```bash
echo "kubectl must be installed manually"
```
