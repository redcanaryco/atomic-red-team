    Stops a specified service killng the service's process.
    This technique was used by WannaCry. Upon execution, if the spoolsv service was running "SUCCESS: The process "spoolsv.exe" with PID 2316 has been terminated."
    will be displayed. If the service was not running "ERROR: The process "spoolsv.exe" not found." will be displayed and it can be
    started by running the cleanup command.

  description: |
    Stops a specified service by sending a SIGTERM signal to the linked process using the killall command.
    Upon execution, if the service's main process was running, it will be terminated.
    If the service was not running, no process will be found to kill and it can be restarted by running the cleanup command.

- name: Linux - Stop service by killing process using pkill
  description: |
    Stops a specified service by sending a SIGTERM signal to the linked process using pkill. This method is effective when multiple instances of the process may be running.
    Upon execution, if any instances of the process were running, they will be terminated. If no instances were running, pkill will not find any processes to kill.
    Stopped service can be restarted by running the cleanup command.
