  description: |
    Scan ports to check for listening ports.

    Upon successful execution, sh will perform a network connection against a single host (192.168.1.1) and determine what ports are open in the range of 1-65535. Results will be via stdout.
  supported_platforms:
  - linux
  - macos
  executor:
    command: |
      for port in {1..65535};
      do
        echo >/dev/tcp/192.168.1.1/$port && echo "port $port is open" || echo "port $port is closed" : ;
      done
    name: sh
- name: Port Scan Nmap
  description: |
    Scan ports to check for listening ports with Nmap.

    Upon successful execution, sh will utilize nmap, telnet, and nc to contact a single or range of adresseses on port 80 to determine if listening. Results will be via stdout.

  - linux
