# T1611 - Escape to Host
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1611)
<blockquote>Adversaries may break out of a container to gain access to the underlying host. This can allow an adversary access to other containerized resources from the host level or to the host itself. In principle, containerized resources should provide a clear separation of application functionality and be isolated from the host environment.(Citation: Docker Overview)

There are multiple ways an adversary may escape to a host environment. Examples include creating a container configured to mount the hostâ€™s filesystem using the bind parameter, which allows the adversary to drop payloads and execute control utilities such as cron on the host, or utilizing a privileged container to run commands on the underlying host.(Citation: Docker Bind Mounts)(Citation: Trend Micro Privileged Container)(Citation: Intezer Doki July 20) Adversaries may also escape via [Exploitation for Privilege Escalation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1068), such as exploiting vulnerabilities in global symbolic links in order to access the root directory of a host machine.(Citation: Windows Server Containers Are Open)

Gaining access to the host may provide the adversary with the opportunity to achieve follow-on objectives, such as establishing persistence, moving laterally within the environment, or setting up a command and control channel on the host.</blockquote>

## Atomic Test #1 - Deploy container using nsenter container escape
In this escape `kubectl` is used to launch a new pod, with a container that has the host pids mapped into the container (`hostPID:true`). It uses the alpine linux container image. It runs with privilege on the host (`privileged:true`). When the container is launched the command `nsenter --mount=/proc/1/ns/mnt -- /bin/bash` is ran. Since the host processes have been mapped into the container, the container enters the host namespace, escaping the container.

## Atomic Test #2 - Mount host filesystem to escape privileged Docker container
This technique abuses privileged Docker containers to mount the host's filesystem and then create a cron job to launch a reverse shell as the host's superuser.
The container running the test needs be privileged.  It may take up to a minute for this to run due to how often crond triggers a job.
Dev note: the echo to create cron_filename is broken up to prevent localized execution of hostname and id by Powershell.
