# T1016 - System Network Configuration Discovery
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1016)
<blockquote>Adversaries will likely look for details about the network configuration and settings of systems they access or through information discovery of remote systems. Several operating system administration utilities exist that can be used to gather this information. Examples include [Arp](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0099), [ipconfig](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0100)/[ifconfig](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0101), [nbtstat](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0102), and [route](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0103).

Adversaries may use the information from [System Network Configuration Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1016) during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors, including whether or not the adversary fully infects the target and/or attempts specific actions.</blockquote>

## Atomic Test #1 - System Network Configuration Discovery
Identify network configuration information

**Supported Platforms:** Windows



#### Attack Commands: Run with `command_prompt`! 


```cmd
ipconfig /all
netsh interface show
arp -a
nbtstat -n
net config
```






<br/>
<br/>

## Atomic Test #2 - List Windows Firewall Rules
Enumerates Windows Firewall Rules using netsh.

**Supported Platforms:** Windows



#### Attack Commands: Run with `command_prompt`! 


```cmd
netsh advfirewall firewall show rule name=all
```






<br/>
<br/>

## Atomic Test #3 - System Network Configuration Discovery
Identify network configuration information

**Supported Platforms:** macOS, Linux



#### Attack Commands: Run with `sh`! 


```sh
arp -a
netstat -ant | awk '{print $NF}' | grep -v '[a-z]' | sort | uniq -c
ifconfig
```






<br/>
<br/>

## Atomic Test #4 - System Network Configuration Discovery (Trickbot Style)

**Supported Platforms:** Windows



#### Attack Commands: Run with `command_prompt`! 


```cmd
ipconfig /all
net config workstation
net view /all /domain
nltest /domain_trusts
```

## Atomic Test #5 - List Open Egress Ports
This is to test for what ports are open outbound.  The technique used was taken from the following blog:
https://www.blackhillsinfosec.com/poking-holes-in-the-firewall-egress-testing-with-allports-exposed/

**Supported Platforms:** Windows


#### Inputs:
| Name | Description | Type | Default Value | 
|------|-------------|------|---------------|
| port_file | The path to a text file containing ports to be scanned, one port per line. The default list uses the top 128 ports as defined by Nmap. | Path | PathToAtomicsFolder\T1016\src\top-128.txt|
| portfile_url | URL to top-128.txt | Url | https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/raw/master/atomics/T1016/src/top-128.txt|
| output_file | Path of file to write port scan results | Path | $env:USERPROFILE\Desktop\open-ports.txt|


#### Attack Commands: Run with `powershell`! 


```powershell
$ports = Get-content #{port_file}
$file = "#{output_file}"
$totalopen = 0
$totalports = 0
New-Item $file -Force
foreach ($port in $ports) {
    $test = new-object system.Net.Sockets.TcpClient
    $wait = $test.beginConnect("allports.exposed", $port, $null, $null)
    $wait.asyncwaithandle.waitone(250, $false) | Out-Null
    $totalports++ | Out-Null
    if ($test.Connected) {
        $result = "$port open" 
        Write-Host -ForegroundColor Green $result
        $result | Out-File -Encoding ASCII -append $file
        $totalopen++ | Out-Null
    }
    else {
        $result = "$port closed" 
        Write-Host -ForegroundColor Red $result
        $totalclosed++ | Out-Null
        $result | Out-File -Encoding ASCII -append $file
    }
}
$results = "There were a total of $totalopen open ports out of $totalports ports tested."
$results | Out-File -Encoding ASCII -append $file
Write-Host $results
```

#### Cleanup Commands:
```
Remove-Item -ErrorAction ignore "#{output_file}"
```


#### Dependencies:  Run with `powershell`!
##### Description: Test requires #{port_file} to exist
##### Check Prereq Commands:
```
if (Test-Path "#{port_file}") {exit 0} else {exit 1} 
```
##### Get Prereq Commands:
```
New-Item -Type Directory (split-path #{port_file}) -ErrorAction ignore | Out-Null
Invoke-WebRequest "#{portfile_url}" -OutFile "#{port_file}"
```
