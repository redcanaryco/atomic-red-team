# T1552.004 - Private Keys
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1552.004)
<blockquote>Adversaries may search for private key certificate files on compromised systems for insecurely stored credentials. Private cryptographic keys and certificates are used for authentication, encryption/decryption, and digital signatures.(Citation: Wikipedia Public Key Crypto) Common key and certificate file extensions include: .key, .pgp, .gpg, .ppk., .p12, .pem, .pfx, .cer, .p7b, .asc. 

Adversaries may also look in common key directories, such as <code>~/.ssh</code> for SSH keys on * nix-based systems or <code>C:&#92;Users&#92;(username)&#92;.ssh&#92;</code> on Windows. These private keys can be used to authenticate to [Remote Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021) like SSH or for use in decrypting other collected files such as email.

Adversary tools have been discovered that search compromised systems for file extensions relating to cryptographic keys and certificates.(Citation: Kaspersky Careto)(Citation: Palo Alto Prince of Persia)

Some private keys require a password or passphrase for operation, so an adversary may also use [Input Capture](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1056) for keylogging or attempt to [Brute Force](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110) the passphrase off-line.</blockquote>

## Atomic Test #1 - Private Keys
Find private keys on the Windows file system.
File extensions include: .key, .pgp, .gpg, .ppk., .p12, .pem, pfx, .cer, .p7b, .asc

**Supported Platforms:** Windows





#### Attack Commands: Run with `command_prompt`!  Elevation Required (e.g. root or admin) 


```cmd
dir c:\ /b /s .key | findstr /e .key
```






<br/>
<br/>

## Atomic Test #2 - Discover Private SSH Keys
Discover private SSH keys on a macOS or Linux system.

**Supported Platforms:** macOS, Linux




#### Inputs:
| Name | Description | Type | Default Value | 
|------|-------------|------|---------------|
| search_path | Path where to start searching from. | path | /|
| output_file | Output file containing locations of SSH key files | path | /tmp/keyfile_locations.txt|


#### Attack Commands: Run with `sh`! 


```sh
find #{search_path} -name id_rsa >> #{output_file}
find #{search_path} -name id_dsa >> #{output_file}
```

#### Cleanup Commands:
```sh
rm #{output_file}
```





<br/>
<br/>

## Atomic Test #3 - Copy Private SSH Keys with CP
Copy private SSH keys on a Linux system to a staging folder using the `cp` command.

**Supported Platforms:** Linux




#### Inputs:
| Name | Description | Type | Default Value | 
|------|-------------|------|---------------|
| search_path | Path where to start searching from. | path | /|
| output_folder | Output folder containing copies of SSH private key files | path | /tmp/art-staging|


#### Attack Commands: Run with `sh`! 


```sh
mkdir #{output_folder}
find #{search_path} -name id_rsa -exec cp --parents {} #{output_folder} \;
find #{search_path} -name id_dsa -exec cp --parents {} #{output_folder} \;
```

#### Cleanup Commands:
```sh
rm #{output_folder}
```





<br/>
<br/>

## Atomic Test #4 - Copy Private SSH Keys with rsync
Copy private SSH keys on a Linux or macOS system to a staging folder using the `rsync` command.

**Supported Platforms:** macOS, Linux




#### Inputs:
| Name | Description | Type | Default Value | 
|------|-------------|------|---------------|
| search_path | Path where to start searching from. | path | /|
| output_folder | Output folder containing copies of SSH private key files | path | /tmp/art-staging|


#### Attack Commands: Run with `sh`! 


```sh
mkdir #{output_folder}
find #{search_path} -name id_rsa -exec rsync -R {} #{output_folder} \;
find #{search_path} -name id_dsa -exec rsync -R {} #{output_folder} \;
```

#### Cleanup Commands:
```sh
rm -rf #{output_folder}
```
