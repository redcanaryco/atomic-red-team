    Methods to identify Security Software on an endpoint

    when sucessfully executed, powershell is going to processes related AV products if they are running.
    Note that, depending on the privilege of current user, get-process | ?{$_.Description -like "*"} may not return the processes related to AV products of the check.
    For instance, only with Administrator right, you can see the process description of McAffee processes. Hence, it is better to use get-process | ?{$_.ProcessName -like "*"},
    if you know the name of those processes.

  description: |
    In this test, a WMIC command is used to probe the local Windows system for the configuration of Windows Defender's exclusions. This command targets the MSFT_MpPreference 
    class within the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) namespace, allowing the retrieval of critical settings such as disabled real-time monitoring and specified 
    exclusion paths, file extensions, and processes. Attackers might use this approach to understand what is excluded from antivirus scans, enabling further exploitation.
