# T1518.001 - Software Discovery: Security Software Discovery
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1518/001)
<blockquote>Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of security software, configurations, defensive tools, and sensors that are installed on a system or in a cloud environment. This may include things such as cloud monitoring agents and anti-virus. Adversaries may use the information from [Security Software Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1518/001) during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors, including whether or not the adversary fully infects the target and/or attempts specific actions.

Example commands that can be used to obtain security software information are [netsh](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0108), <code>reg query</code> with [Reg](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0075), <code>dir</code> with [cmd](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0106), and [Tasklist](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0057), but other indicators of discovery behavior may be more specific to the type of software or security system the adversary is looking for. It is becoming more common to see macOS malware perform checks for LittleSnitch and KnockKnock software.

Adversaries may also utilize the [Cloud API](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/009) to discover cloud-native security software installed on compute infrastructure, such as the AWS CloudWatch agent, Azure VM Agent, and Google Cloud Monitor agent. These agents  may collect  metrics and logs from the VM, which may be centrally aggregated in a cloud-based monitoring platform.</blockquote>

## Atomic Test #1 - Security Software Discovery
Methods to identify Security Software on an endpoint

when sucessfully executed, the test is going to display running processes, firewall configuration on network profiles
and specific security software.

**Supported Platforms:** Windows


**auto_generated_guid:** f92a380f-ced9-491f-b338-95a991418ce2






#### Attack Commands: Run with `command_prompt`! 


```cmd
netsh.exe advfirewall  show allprofiles 
netsh.exe advfirewall firewall dump
netsh.exe advfirewall show currentprofile
netsh.exe advfirewall firewall show rule name=all
netsh.exe firewall show state
netsh.exe firewall show config
sc query windefend
powershell.exe /c "Get-Process | Where-Object { $_.ProcessName -eq 'Sysmon' }"

tasklist.exe | findstr /i "virus cb defender cylance mc"
```






<br/>
<br/>

## Atomic Test #2 - Security Software Discovery - powershell
Methods to identify Security Software on an endpoint

when sucessfully executed, powershell is going to processes related AV products if they are running.
Note that, depending on the privilege of current user, get-process | ?{$_.Description -like "*"} may not return the processes related to AV products of the check.
For instance, only with Administrator right, you can see the process description of McAffee processes. Hence, it is better to use get-process | ?{$_.ProcessName -like "*"},
if you know the name of those processes.

**Supported Platforms:** Windows
