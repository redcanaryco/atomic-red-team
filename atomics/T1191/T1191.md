# T1191 - CMSTP
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1191)
<blockquote>The Microsoft Connection Manager Profile Installer (CMSTP.exe) is a command-line program used to install Connection Manager service profiles. (Citation: Microsoft Connection Manager Oct 2009) CMSTP.exe accepts an installation information file (INF) as a parameter and installs a service profile leveraged for remote access connections.

Adversaries may supply CMSTP.exe with INF files infected with malicious commands. (Citation: Twitter CMSTP Usage Jan 2018) Similar to [Regsvr32](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1117) / ”Squiblydoo”, CMSTP.exe may be abused to load and execute DLLs (Citation: MSitPros CMSTP Aug 2017)  and/or COM scriptlets (SCT) from remote servers. (Citation: Twitter CMSTP Jan 2018) (Citation: GitHub Ultimate AppLocker Bypass List) (Citation: Endurant CMSTP July 2018) This execution may also bypass AppLocker and other whitelisting defenses since CMSTP.exe is a legitimate, signed Microsoft application.

CMSTP.exe can also be abused to [Bypass User Account Control](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1088) and execute arbitrary commands from a malicious INF through an auto-elevated COM interface. (Citation: MSitPros CMSTP Aug 2017) (Citation: GitHub Ultimate AppLocker Bypass List) (Citation: Endurant CMSTP July 2018)</blockquote>

## Atomic Tests

- [Atomic Test #2 - CMSTP Executing UAC Bypass](#atomic-test-2---cmstp-executing-uac-bypass)


<br/>

## Atomic Test #1 - CMSTP Executing Remote Scriptlet
Adversaries may supply CMSTP.exe with INF files infected with malicious commands

**Supported Platforms:** Windows


#### Inputs
| Name | Description | Type | Default Value | 
|------|-------------|------|---------------|
| inf_file_path | Path to the INF file | path | PathToAtomicsFolder\T1191\src\T1191.inf|

#### Run it with `command_prompt`! 
```
cmstp.exe /s #{inf_file_path}
```

## Atomic Test #2 - CMSTP Executing UAC Bypass
Adversaries may invoke cmd.exe (or other malicious commands) by embedding them in the RunPreSetupCommandsSection of an INF file

**Supported Platforms:** Windows


#### Inputs
| Name | Description | Type | Default Value | 
|------|-------------|------|---------------|
| inf_file_uac | Path to the INF file | path | PathToAtomicsFolder\T1191\src\T1191_uacbypass.inf|

#### Run it with `command_prompt`! 
```
cmstp.exe /s #{inf_file_uac} /au
```
