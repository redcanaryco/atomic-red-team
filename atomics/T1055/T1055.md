# T1055 - Process Injection
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055)
<blockquote>Adversaries may inject code into processes in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges. Process injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process. Running code in the context of another process may allow access to the process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges. Execution via process injection may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process. 

There are many different ways to inject code into a process, many of which abuse legitimate functionalities. These implementations exist for every major OS but are typically platform specific. 

More sophisticated samples may perform multiple process injections to segment modules and further evade detection, utilizing named pipes or other inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms as a communication channel. </blockquote>

## Atomic Test #1 - Shellcode execution via VBA
This module injects shellcode into a newly created process and executes. By default the shellcode is created,
with Metasploit, for use on x86-64 Windows 10 machines.

Note: Due to the way the VBA code handles memory/pointers/injection, a 64bit installation of Microsoft Office
is required.

## Atomic Test #2 - Remote Process Injection in LSASS via mimikatz
Use mimikatz to remotely (via psexec) dump LSASS process content for RID 500 via code injection (new thread).
Especially useful against domain controllers in Active Directory environments.
It must be executed in the context of a user who is privileged on remote `machine`.

## Atomic Test #3 - Section View Injection
This test creates a section object in the local process followed by a local section view.
The shellcode is copied into the local section view and a remote section view is created in the target process, pointing to the local section view. 
A thread is then created in the target process, using the remote section view as start address.

## Atomic Test #4 - Dirty Vanity process Injection
This test used the Windows undocumented remote-fork API RtlCreateProcessReflection to create a cloned process of the parent process
with shellcode written in its memory. The shellcode is executed after being forked to the child process. The technique was first presented at 
BlackHat Europe 2022. Shellcode will open a messsage box and a notepad.

## Atomic Test #5 - Read-Write-Execute process Injection
This test exploited the vulnerability in legitimate PE formats where sections have RWX permission and enough space for shellcode.
The RWX injection avoided the use of VirtualAlloc, WriteVirtualMemory, and ProtectVirtualMemory, thus evading detection mechanisms 
that relied on API call sequences and heuristics. The RWX injection utilises API call sequences: LoadLibrary --> GetModuleInformation --> GetModuleHandleA --> RtlCopyMemory --> CreateThread.
The injected shellcode will open a message box and a notepad.
RWX Process Injection, also known as MockingJay, was introduced to the security community by SecurityJoes.
More details can be found at https://www.securityjoes.com/post/process-mockingjay-echoing-rwx-in-userland-to-achieve-code-execution.
The original injector and idea were developed for game cheats, as visible at https://github.com/M-r-J-o-h-n/SWH-Injector.

## Atomic Test #6 - Process Injection with Go using UuidFromStringA WinAPI
Uses WinAPI UuidFromStringA to load shellcode to a memory address then executes the shellcode using EnumSystemLocalesA.
With this technique, memory is allocated on the heap and does not use commonly suspicious APIs such as VirtualAlloc, WriteProcessMemory, or CreateThread

## Atomic Test #7 - Process Injection with Go using EtwpCreateEtwThread WinAPI
Uses EtwpCreateEtwThread function from ntdll.dll to execute shellcode within the application's process.
This program loads the DLLs and gets a handle to the used procedures itself instead of using the windows package directly.

Steps taken with this technique
1. Allocate memory for the shellcode with VirtualAlloc setting the page permissions to Read/Write
2. Use the RtlCopyMemory macro to copy the shellcode to the allocated memory space
3. Change the memory page permissions to Execute/Read with VirtualProtect
4. Call EtwpCreateEtwThread on shellcode address
5. Call WaitForSingleObject so the program does not end before the shellcode is executed

1. Get a handle to the target process
2. Allocate memory for the shellcode with VirtualAllocEx setting the page permissions to Read/Write
3. Use the WriteProcessMemory to copy the shellcode to the allocated memory space in the remote process

## Atomic Test #13 - UUID custom process Injection
The UUIDs Process Injection code was first introduced by the NCC Group. The code can be stored in UUID forms on the heap and converted back to binary via UuidFromStringA at runtime. In this new custom version of UUID injection, EnumSystemLocalesA is the only API called to execute the code. We used custom UuidToString and UuidFromString implementations to avoid using UuidFromStringA and RPCRT4.dll, thereby eliminating the static signatures. This technique also avoided the use of VirtualAlloc, WriteProcessMemory and CreateThread

The injected shellcode will open a message box and a notepad.
