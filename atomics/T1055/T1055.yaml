- name: Process Injection via mavinject.exe
  description: |
    Windows 10 Utility To Inject DLLS.

    Upon successful execution, powershell.exe will download T1055.dll to disk. Powershell will then spawn mavinject.exe to perform process injection in T1055.dll.

- name: Shared Library Injection via /etc/ld.so.preload
  description: |
    This test adds a shared library to the `ld.so.preload` list to execute and intercept API calls. This technique was used by threat actor Rocke during the exploitation of Linux web servers. This requires the `glibc` package.
    
    Upon successful execution, bash will echo `../bin/T1055.so` to /etc/ld.so.preload.

- name: Shared Library Injection via LD_PRELOAD
  description: |
    This test injects a shared object library via the LD_PRELOAD environment variable to execute. This technique was used by threat actor Rocke during the exploitation of Linux web servers. This requires the `glibc` package.

    Upon successful execution, bash will utilize LD_PRELOAD to load the shared object library `/etc/ld.so.preload`. Output will be via stdout.

    Process Injection using C#
    reference: https://github.com/pwndizzle/c-sharp-memory-injection
    Excercises Five Techniques
    1. Process injection
    2. ApcInjectionAnyProcess
    3. ApcInjectionNewProcess
    4. IatInjection
    5. ThreadHijack
    Upon successful execution, cmd.exe will execute T1055.exe, which exercises 5 techniques. Output will be via stdout.
