  description: |-
    Uses the built-in PowerShell commandlet Get-EventLog to search for 'SYSTEM' keyword and saves results to a text file.

    This technique was observed in a [TheDFIRReport case](https://thedfirreport.com/2023/04/03/malicious-iso-file-leads-to-domain-wide-ransomware/) 
    where the threat actor enumerated the Windows Security audit log to determine user accounts and associated IPv4 addresses.

    Successful execution will save matching log events to the users temp folder.
