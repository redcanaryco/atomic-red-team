  auto_generated_guid: a9030b20-dd4b-4405-875e-3462c6078fdc
  description: |-
    Uses the built-in PowerShell commandlet Get-EventLog to search for 'SYSTEM' keyword and saves results to a text file.

    This technique was observed in a [TheDFIRReport case](https://thedfirreport.com/2023/04/03/malicious-iso-file-leads-to-domain-wide-ransomware/) 
    where the threat actor enumerated the Windows Security audit log to determine user accounts and associated IPv4 addresses.

    Successful execution will save matching log events to the users temp folder.

  description: |- 
    WevtUtil is a command line tool that can be utilised by adversaries to gather intelligence on a targeted Windows system's logging infrastructure. 
  
    By executing this command, malicious actors can enumerate all available event logs, including both default logs such as Application, Security, and System
    as well as any custom logs created by administrators. 
  
    This information provides valuable insight into the system's logging mechanisms, potentially allowing attackers to identify gaps or weaknesses in the logging configuration
