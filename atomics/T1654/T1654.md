# T1654 - Log Enumeration
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1654)
<blockquote>Adversaries may enumerate system and service logs to find useful data. These logs may highlight various types of valuable insights for an adversary, such as user authentication records ([Account Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1087)), security or vulnerable software ([Software Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1518)), or hosts within a compromised network ([Remote System Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1018)).

Host binaries may be leveraged to collect system logs. Examples include using `wevtutil.exe` or [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001) on Windows to access and/or export security event information.(Citation: WithSecure Lazarus-NoPineapple Threat Intel Report 2023)(Citation: Cadet Blizzard emerges as novel threat actor) In cloud environments, adversaries may leverage utilities such as the Azure VM Agentâ€™s `CollectGuestLogs.exe` to collect security logs from cloud hosted infrastructure.(Citation: SIM Swapping and Abuse of the Microsoft Azure Serial Console)

Adversaries may also target centralized logging infrastructure such as SIEMs. Logs may also be bulk exported and sent to adversary-controlled infrastructure for offline analysis.</blockquote>

## Atomic Tests

- [Atomic Test #1 - Get-EventLog To Enumerate Windows Security Log](#atomic-test-1---get-eventlog-to-enumerate-windows-security-log)


<br/>

## Atomic Test #1 - Get-EventLog To Enumerate Windows Security Log
Uses the built-in PowerShell commandlet Get-EventLog to search for 'SYSTEM' keyword and saves results to a text file.

This technique was observed in a [TheDFIRReport case](https://thedfirreport.com/2023/04/03/malicious-iso-file-leads-to-domain-wide-ransomware/) 
where the threat actor enumerated the Windows Security audit log to determine user accounts and associated IPv4 addresses.

Successful execution will save matching log events to the users temp folder.

**Supported Platforms:** Windows


**auto_generated_guid:** a9030b20-dd4b-4405-875e-3462c6078fdc






#### Attack Commands: Run with `powershell`!  Elevation Required (e.g. root or admin) 


```powershell
powershell -c {get-eventlog 'Security' | where {$_.Message -like '*SYSTEM*'} | export-csv $env:temp\T1654_events.txt}
```

#### Cleanup Commands:
```powershell
powershell -c "remove-item $env:temp\T1654_events.txt -ErrorAction Ignore"
```
