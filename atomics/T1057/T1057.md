# T1057 - Process Discovery
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1057)
<blockquote>Adversaries may attempt to get information about running processes on a system. Information obtained could be used to gain an understanding of common software running on systems within the network. Adversaries may use the information from [Process Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1057) during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors, including whether or not the adversary fully infects the target and/or attempts specific actions.

### Windows

An example command that would obtain details on processes is "tasklist" using the [Tasklist](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0057) utility.

### Mac and Linux

In Mac and Linux, this is accomplished with the <code>ps</code> command.</blockquote>
