# T1059.004 - Command and Scripting Interpreter: Bash
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/004)
<blockquote>Adversaries may abuse Unix shell commands and scripts for execution. Unix shells are the primary command prompt on Linux and macOS systems, though many variations of the Unix shell exist (e.g. sh, bash, zsh, etc.) depending on the specific OS or distribution.(Citation: DieNet Bash)(Citation: Apple ZShell) Unix shells can control every aspect of a system, with certain commands requiring elevated privileges.

Unix shells also support scripts that enable sequential execution of commands as well as other typical programming operations such as conditionals and loops. Common uses of shell scripts include long or repetitive tasks, or the need to run the same set of commands on multiple systems.

Adversaries may abuse Unix shells to execute various commands or payloads. Interactive shells may be accessed through command and control channels or during lateral movement such as with [SSH](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/004). Adversaries may also leverage shell scripts to deliver and execute multiple commands on victims or as part of payloads used for persistence.</blockquote>

```






<br/>
<br/>

## Atomic Test #9 - Obfuscated command line scripts
An adversary may pre-compute the base64 representations of the terminal commands that they wish to execute in an attempt to avoid or frustrate detection. The following commands base64 encodes the text string id, then base64 decodes the string, then pipes it as a command to bash, which results in the id command being executed.

echo -n "$ART" | $decodecmd |/bin/bash
unset ART
```






<br/>
<br/>

[ "$(uname)" = 'FreeBSD' ] && pw useradd art -g wheel -s /bin/csh || useradd -s /bin/bash art
cat /etc/passwd |grep ^art
chsh -s /bin/sh art
cat /etc/passwd |grep ^art
```

## Atomic Test #11 - Environment variable scripts
An adversary may place scripts in an environment variable because they can't or don't wish to create script files on the host. The following test, in a bash shell, exports the ART variable containing an echo command, then pipes the variable to /bin/bash

**Supported Platforms:** Linux


**auto_generated_guid:** bdaebd56-368b-4970-a523-f905ff4a8a51






#### Attack Commands: Run with `sh`! 


```sh
export ART='echo "Atomic Red Team was here... T1059.004"'
echo $ART |/bin/sh
```

#### Cleanup Commands:
```sh
unset ART
```





<br/>
<br/>

## Atomic Test #12 - Detecting pipe-to-shell
An adversary may develop a useful utility or subvert the CI/CD pipe line of a legitimate utility developer, who requires or suggests installing their utility by piping a curl download directly into bash. Of-course this is a very bad idea. The adversary may also take advantage of this BLIND install method and selectively running extra commands in the install script for those who DO pipe to bash and not for those who DO NOT. This test uses curl to download the pipe-to-shell.sh script, the first time without piping it to bash and the second piping it into bash which executes the echo command.

**Supported Platforms:** Linux


**auto_generated_guid:** fca246a8-a585-4f28-a2df-6495973976a1
