# T1136.003 - Create Account: Cloud Account
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1136/003)
<blockquote>Adversaries may create a cloud account to maintain access to victim systems. With a sufficient level of access, such accounts may be used to establish secondary credentialed access that does not require persistent remote access tools to be deployed on the system.(Citation: Microsoft O365 Admin Roles)(Citation: Microsoft Support O365 Add Another Admin, October 2019)(Citation: AWS Create IAM User)(Citation: GCP Create Cloud Identity Users)(Citation: Microsoft Azure AD Users)

Adversaries may create accounts that only have access to specific cloud services, which can reduce the chance of detection.</blockquote>
