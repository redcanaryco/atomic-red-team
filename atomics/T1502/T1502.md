# T1502 - Parent PID Spoofing
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1502)
<blockquote>Adversaries may spoof the parent process identifier (PPID) of a new process to evade process-monitoring defenses or to elevate privileges. New processes are typically spawned directly from their parent, or calling, process unless explicitly specified. One way of explicitly assigning the PPID of a new process is via the <code>CreateProcess</code> API call, which supports a parameter that defines the PPID to use.(Citation: DidierStevens SelectMyParent Nov 2009) This functionality is used by Windows features such as User Account Control (UAC) to correctly set the PPID after a requested elevated process is spawned by SYSTEM (typically via <code>svchost.exe</code> or <code>consent.exe</code>) rather than the current user context.(Citation: Microsoft UAC Nov 2018)

Adversaries may abuse these mechanisms to evade defenses, such as those blocking processes spawning directly from Office documents, and analysis targeting unusual/potentially malicious parent-child process relationships, such as spoofing the PPID of [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1086)/[Rundll32](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1085) to be <code>explorer.exe</code> rather than an Office document delivered as part of [Spearphishing Attachment](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1193).(Citation: CounterCept PPID Spoofing Dec 2018) This spoofing could be executed via VBA [Scripting](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1064) within a malicious Office document or any code that can perform [Execution through API](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1106).(Citation: CTD PPID Spoofing Macro Mar 2019)(Citation: CounterCept PPID Spoofing Dec 2018)

Explicitly assigning the PPID may also enable [Privilege Escalation](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0004) (given appropriate access rights to the parent process). For example, an adversary in a privileged user context (i.e. administrator) may spawn a new process and assign the parent as a process running as SYSTEM (such as <code>lsass.exe</code>), causing the new process to be elevated via the inherited access token.(Citation: XPNSec PPID Nov 2017)</blockquote>

## Atomic Test #1 - Parent PID Spoofing using PowerShell
This test uses PowerShell to replicates how Cobalt Strike does ppid spoofing and masquerade a spawned process.

**Supported Platforms:** Windows


#### Inputs
| Name | Description | Type | Default Value | 
|------|-------------|------|---------------|
| parent_process_name | Name of the parent process | string | explorer|
| dll_path | Path of the dll to inject | string | $PathToAtomicsFolder\T1502\bin\calc.dll|
| dll_process_name | Name of the created process from the injected dll | string | calculator|
| spawnto_process_path | Path of the process to spawn | string | C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe|
| spawnto_process_name | Name of the process to spawn | string | iexplore|

#### Run it with `powershell`! 
```
. $PathToAtomicsFolder\T1502\src\PPID-Spoof.ps1
$ppid=Get-Process #{parent_process_name} | select -expand id
PPID-Spoof -ppid $ppid -spawnto "#{spawnto_process_path}" -dllpath "#{dll_path}"
```


#### Cleanup Commands:
```
Stop-Process -Name "#{dll_process_name}"
Stop-Process -Name "#{spawnto_process_name}"
```
