  description: |
    When a service is created whose executable path contains spaces and isnâ€™t enclosed within quotes, leads to a vulnerability
    known as Unquoted Service Path which allows a user to gain SYSTEM privileges.
    In this case, if an executable program.exe in C:\ exists, C:\program.exe will be executed instead of test.exe in C:\Program Files\subfolder\test.exe.
