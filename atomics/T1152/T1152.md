# T1152 - Launchctl
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1152)
<blockquote>Launchctl controls the macOS launchd process which handles things like launch agents and launch daemons, but can execute other commands or programs itself. Launchctl supports taking subcommands on the command-line, interactively, or even redirected from standard input. By loading or reloading launch agents or launch daemons, adversaries can install persistence or execute changes they made  (Citation: Sofacy Komplex Trojan). Running a command from launchctl is as simple as <code>launchctl submit -l <labelName> -- /Path/to/thing/to/execute "arg" "arg" "arg"</code>. Loading, unloading, or reloading launch agents or launch daemons can require elevated privileges. 

Adversaries can abuse this functionality to execute code or even bypass whitelisting if launchctl is an allowed process.</blockquote>
