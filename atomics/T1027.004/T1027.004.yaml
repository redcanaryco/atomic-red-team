  description: "When C# is compiled dynamically, a .cmdline file will be created as a part of the process. \nCertain processes are not typically observed compiling C# code, but can do so without touching disk. This can be used to unpack a payload for execution.\nThe exe file that will be executed is named as T1500_DynamicCompile.exe is containted in the 'bin' folder of this atomic, and the source code to the file is in the 'src' folder.\nUpon execution, the exe will print 'T1500 Dynamic Compile'.\n"
