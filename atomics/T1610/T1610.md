# T1610 - Deploy Container
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1610)
<blockquote>Adversaries may deploy a container into an environment to facilitate execution or evade defenses. In some cases, adversaries may deploy a new container to execute processes associated with a particular image or deployment, such as processes that execute or download malware. In others, an adversary may deploy a new container configured without network rules, user limitations, etc. to bypass existing defenses within the environment.

Containers can be deployed by various means, such as via Docker's <code>create</code> and <code>start</code> APIs or via a web application such as the Kubernetes dashboard or Kubeflow.(Citation: Docker Containers API)(Citation: Kubernetes Dashboard)(Citation: Kubeflow Pipelines) Adversaries may deploy containers based on retrieved or built malicious images or from benign images that download and execute malicious payloads at runtime.(Citation: Aqua Build Images on Hosts)</blockquote>

## Atomic Test #1 - Deploy container using nsenter container escape
In this escape `kubectl` is used to launch a new pod, with a container that has the host pids mapped into the container (`hostPID:true`). It uses the alpine linux container image. It runs with privilege on the host (`privileged:true`). When the container is launched the command `nsenter --mount=/proc/1/ns/mnt -- /bin/bash` is ran. Since the host processes have been mapped into the container, the container enters the host namespace, escaping the container.
