# T1022 - Data Encrypted
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1022)
<blockquote>Data is encrypted before being exfiltrated in order to hide the information that is being exfiltrated from detection or to make the exfiltration less conspicuous upon inspection by a defender. The encryption is performed by a utility, programming library, or custom algorithm on the data itself and is considered separate from any encryption performed by the command and control or file transfer protocol. Common file archive formats that can encrypt files are RAR and zip.

Other exfiltration techniques likely apply as well to transfer the information out of the network, such as [Exfiltration Over Command and Control Channel](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1041) and [Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1048)</blockquote>

## Atomic Test #1 - Data Encrypted with zip and gpg
Encrypt data for exiltration

**Supported Platforms:** macOS, CentOS, Ubuntu, Linux


#### Run it with `sh`! 
```
echo "This file will be encrypted" > /tmp/victim-gpg.txt
mkdir /tmp/victim-files
cd /tmp/victim-files
touch a b c d e f g
zip --password "insert password here" /tmp/victim-files.zip /tmp/victim-files/*
gpg -c /tmp/victim-gpg.txt
<enter passphrase and confirm>
ls -l
```

Note: Requires winrar installation
rar a -p"blue" hello.rar (VARIANT)

**Supported Platforms:** Windows


#### Run it with `command_prompt`! 
```
mkdir ./tmp/victim-files
cd ./tmp/victim-files
echo "This file will be encrypted" > ./encrypted_file.txt
rar a -hp"blue" hello.rar
dir
```
