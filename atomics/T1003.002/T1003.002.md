# T1003.002 - Security Account Manager
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1003.002)
<blockquote>Adversaries may attempt to extract credential material from the Security Account Manager (SAM) database either through in-memory techniques or through the Windows Registry where the SAM database is stored. The SAM is a database file that contains local accounts for the host, typically those found with the <code>net user</code> command. Enumerating the SAM database requires SYSTEM level access.

A number of tools can be used to retrieve the SAM file through in-memory techniques:

* pwdumpx.exe
* [gsecdump](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0008)
* [Mimikatz](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0002)
* secretsdump.py

Alternatively, the SAM can be extracted from the Registry with Reg:

* <code>reg save HKLM\sam sam</code>
* <code>reg save HKLM\system system</code>

Creddump7 can then be used to process the SAM database locally to retrieve hashes.(Citation: GitHub Creddump7)

Notes: 
* RID 500 account is the local, built-in administrator.
* RID 501 is the guest account.
* User accounts start with a RID of 1,000+.

## Atomic Tests

- [Atomic Test #1 - Registry dump of SAM, creds, and secrets](#atomic-test-1---registry-dump-of-sam-creds-and-secrets)

- [Atomic Test #2 - Registry parse with pypykatz](#atomic-test-2---registry-parse-with-pypykatz)


<br/>

## Atomic Test #1 - Registry dump of SAM, creds, and secrets
Local SAM (SAM & System), cached credentials (System & Security) and LSA secrets (System & Security) can be enumerated
via three registry keys. Then processed locally using https://github.com/Neohapsis/creddump7

Upon successful execution of this test, you will find three files named, sam, system and security in the %temp% directory.

**Supported Platforms:** Windows





#### Attack Commands: Run with `command_prompt`!  Elevation Required (e.g. root or admin) 


```cmd
reg save HKLM\sam %temp%\sam
reg save HKLM\system %temp%\system
reg save HKLM\security %temp%\security
```

#### Cleanup Commands:
```cmd
del %temp%\sam >nul 2> nul
del %temp%\system >nul 2> nul
del %temp%\security >nul 2> nul
```
