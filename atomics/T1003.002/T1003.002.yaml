- name: Registry dump of SAM, creds, and secrets
  description: |
    Local SAM (SAM & System), cached credentials (System & Security) and LSA secrets (System & Security) can be enumerated
    via three registry keys. Then processed locally using https://github.com/Neohapsis/creddump7

    Upon successful execution of this test, you will find three files named, sam, system and security in the %temp% directory.
