# T1482 - Domain Trust Discovery
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1482)
<blockquote>Adversaries may attempt to gather information on domain trust relationships that may be used to identify [Lateral Movement](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0008) opportunities in Windows multi-domain/forest environments. Domain trusts provide a mechanism for a domain to allow access to resources based on the authentication procedures of another domain.(Citation: Microsoft Trusts) Domain trusts allow the users of the trusted domain to access resources in the trusting domain. The information discovered may help the adversary conduct [SID-History Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1178), [Pass the Ticket](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1097), and [Kerberoasting](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1208).(Citation: AdSecurity Forging Trust Tickets)(Citation: Harmj0y Domain Trusts) Domain trusts can be enumerated using the DSEnumerateDomainTrusts() Win32 API call, .NET methods, and LDAP.(Citation: Harmj0y Domain Trusts) The Windows utility [Nltest](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0359) is known to be used by adversaries to enumerate domain trusts.(Citation: Microsoft Operation Wilysupply)</blockquote>
