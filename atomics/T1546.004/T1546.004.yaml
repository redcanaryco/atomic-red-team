    The Bash shell runs ~/.bash_logout "if it exists" to run commands on user logout. An adversary may create or append to a .bash_logout to clear history, start processes etc. Note the ~/.bash_logout is only run if you explicitly exit or log out of an "interactive login shell session" i.e. via the console, SSH, /bin/bash -l or su -l <username>. 

    This test creates the art user, logs in, creates a .bash_logout which will echo some text into the art.txt file on logout and logs out and the /home/art/art.txt is created.
