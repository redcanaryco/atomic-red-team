# T1119 - Automated Collection
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1119)
<blockquote>Once established within a system or network, an adversary may use automated techniques for collecting internal data. Methods for performing this technique could include use of a [Command and Scripting Interpreter](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059) to search for and copy information fitting set criteria such as file type, location, or name at specific time intervals. This functionality could also be built into remote access tools. 

This technique may incorporate use of other techniques such as [File and Directory Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1083) and [Lateral Tool Transfer](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1570) to identify and move files.</blockquote>

## Atomic Test #1 - Automated Collection Command Prompt
Automated Collection. Upon execution, check the users temp directory (%temp%) for the folder T1119_command_prompt_collection
to see what was collected.

**Supported Platforms:** Windows





#### Attack Commands: Run with `command_prompt`! 


```cmd
mkdir %temp%\T1119_command_prompt_collection >nul 2>&1
dir c: /b /s .docx | findstr /e .docx
for /R c: %f in (*.docx) do copy %f %temp%\T1119_command_prompt_collection
```

#### Cleanup Commands:
```cmd
del %temp%\T1119_command_prompt_collection /F /Q >null 2>&1
```





<br/>
<br/>

## Atomic Test #2 - Automated Collection PowerShell
Automated Collection. Upon execution, check the users temp directory (%temp%) for the folder T1119_powershell_collection
to see what was collected.

**Supported Platforms:** Windows





#### Attack Commands: Run with `powershell`! 


```powershell
New-Item -Path $env:TEMP\T1119_powershell_collection -ItemType Directory -Force | Out-Null
Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Include *.doc | % {Copy-Item $_.FullName -destination $env:TEMP\T1119_powershell_collection}
```

#### Cleanup Commands:
```powershell
Remove-Item $env:TEMP\T1119_powershell_collection -Force -ErrorAction Ignore | Out-Null
```





<br/>
<br/>

## Atomic Test #3 - Recon information for export with PowerShell
collect information for exfiltration. Upon execution, check the users temp directory (%temp%) for files T1119_*.txt
to see what was collected.

**Supported Platforms:** Windows





#### Attack Commands: Run with `powershell`! 


```powershell
Get-Service > $env:TEMP\T1119_1.txt
Get-ChildItem Env: > $env:TEMP\T1119_2.txt
Get-Process > $env:TEMP\T1119_3.txt
```

#### Cleanup Commands:
```powershell
Remove-Item $env:TEMP\T1119_1.txt -ErrorAction Ignore
Remove-Item $env:TEMP\T1119_2.txt -ErrorAction Ignore
Remove-Item $env:TEMP\T1119_3.txt -ErrorAction Ignore
```





<br/>
<br/>

## Atomic Test #4 - Recon information for export with Command Prompt
collect information for exfiltration. Upon execution, check the users temp directory (%temp%) for files T1119_*.txt
to see what was collected.

**Supported Platforms:** Windows





#### Attack Commands: Run with `command_prompt`! 


```cmd
sc query type=service > %TEMP%\T1119_1.txt
doskey /history > %TEMP%\T1119_2.txt
wmic process list > %TEMP%\T1119_3.txt
tree C:\AtomicRedTeam\atomics > %TEMP%\T1119_4.txt
```

#### Cleanup Commands:
```cmd
del %TEMP%\T1119_1.txt >nul 2>&1
del %TEMP%\T1119_2.txt >nul 2>&1
