# T1119 - Automated Collection
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1119)
<blockquote>Once established within a system or network, an adversary may use automated techniques for collecting internal data. Methods for performing this technique could include use of a [Command and Scripting Interpreter](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059) to search for and copy information fitting set criteria such as file type, location, or name at specific time intervals. In cloud-based environments, adversaries may also use cloud APIs, command line interfaces, or extract, transform, and load (ETL) services to automatically collect data. This functionality could also be built into remote access tools. 

This technique may incorporate use of other techniques such as [File and Directory Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1083) and [Lateral Tool Transfer](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1570) to identify and move files, as well as [Cloud Service Dashboard](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1538) and [Cloud Storage Object Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1619) to identify resources in cloud environments.</blockquote>

## Atomic Test #1 - Automated Collection Command Prompt
Automated Collection. Upon execution, check the users temp directory (%temp%) for the folder T1119_command_prompt_collection
to see what was collected.

**Supported Platforms:** Windows

#### Attack Commands: Run with `command_prompt`! 


```cmd
mkdir %temp%\T1119_command_prompt_collection >nul 2>&1
dir c: /b /s .docx | findstr /e .docx
for /R c:\ %f in (*.docx) do copy /Y %f %temp%\T1119_command_prompt_collection
```

#### Cleanup Commands:
```cmd
del %temp%\T1119_command_prompt_collection /F /Q >nul 2>&1
```
