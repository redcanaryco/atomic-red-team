- name: Search Azure AD User Attributes for Passwords
  description: |
    This test uses the MSOnline Powershell module to retrieve all user attributes for a specified account, which can sometimes contain unsecured credentials. 
    Upon successful execution, this test will scan all user attributes for any strings containing "password".
    Those unsecured credentials will be output to a text file, as well as the account that they are associated with and the user attribute in which they were found.
