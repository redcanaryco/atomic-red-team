# T1550.001 - Use Alternate Authentication Material: Application Access Token
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/001)
<blockquote>

Adversaries may use stolen application access tokens to bypass the typical authentication process and access restricted accounts, information, or services on remote systems. These tokens are typically stolen from users or services and used in lieu of login credentials.

Application access tokens are used to make authorized API requests on behalf of a user or service and are commonly used to access resources in cloud, container-based applications, and software-as-a-service (SaaS).(Citation: Auth0 - Why You Should Always Use Access Tokens to Secure APIs Sept 2019) 

OAuth is one commonly implemented framework that issues tokens to users for access to systems. These frameworks are used collaboratively to verify the user and determine what actions the user is allowed to perform. Once identity is established, the token allows actions to be authorized, without passing the actual credentials of the user. Therefore, compromise of the token can grant the adversary access to resources of other sites through a malicious application.(Citation: okta)

For example, with a cloud-based email service, once an OAuth access token is granted to a malicious application, it can potentially gain long-term access to features of the user account if a "refresh" token enabling background access is awarded.(Citation: Microsoft Identity Platform Access 2019) With an OAuth access token an adversary can use the user-granted REST API to perform functions such as email searching and contact enumeration.(Citation: Staaldraad Phishing with OAuth 2017)

Compromised access tokens may be used as an initial step in compromising other services. For example, if a token grants access to a victim’s primary email, the adversary may be able to extend access to all other services which the target subscribes by triggering forgotten password routines. In AWS and GCP environments, adversaries can trigger a request for a short-lived access token with the privileges of another user account.(Citation: Google Cloud Service Account Credentials)(Citation: AWS Temporary Security Credentials) The adversary can then use this token to request data or perform actions the original account could not. If permissions for this feature are misconfigured – for example, by allowing all users to request a token for a particular account - an adversary may be able to gain initial access to a Cloud Account or escalate their privileges.(Citation: Rhino Security Labs Enumerating AWS Roles)

Direct API access through a token negates the effectiveness of a second authentication factor and may be immune to intuitive countermeasures like changing passwords.  For example, in AWS environments, an adversary who compromises a user’s AWS API credentials may be able to use the `sts:GetFederationToken` API call to create a federated user session, which will have the same permissions as the original user but may persist even if the original user credentials are deactivated.(Citation: Crowdstrike AWS User Federation Persistence) Additionally, access abuse over an API channel can be difficult to detect even from the service provider end, as the access can still align well with a legitimate workflow.

## Atomic Tests

- [Atomic Test #1 - Azure - Functions code upload - Functions code injection via Blob upload](#atomic-test-1---azure---functions-code-upload---functions-code-injection-via-blob-upload)

- [Atomic Test #2 - Azure - Functions code upload - Functions code injection via File Share modification to retrieve the Functions identity access token](#atomic-test-2---azure---functions-code-upload---functions-code-injection-via-file-share-modification-to-retrieve-the-functions-identity-access-token)

## Atomic Test #1 - Azure - Functions code upload - Functions code injection via Blob upload
This test injects code into an Azure Function (RCE).

Attack idea/reference: https://orca.security/resources/blog/azure-shared-key-authorization-exploitation/

Similar to T1550.001 "Azure - Functions code upload - Functions code injection to retrieve the Functions identity access token", the depicted code injection scenario tampers the source code of Azure Functions to perform Subscription Privilege Escalation by retrieving the identity access token of an Azure functions instance. In this case, the prepared zip file (underlying package for a Function) is expected to contain the tampered function presented in src/code_to_insert.py. Note that the endpoint https://changeme.net needs to be adapted in your packed function code.

Note:
- The Azure Function modified in this test must be hosted via Azure Blob storage (Info on storage considerations for Azure Function: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/storage-considerations). 
- For Function code upload to Azure Functions that are hosted via Azure Files in a File Share, refer to T1550.001 "Azure - Functions code upload - Functions code injection to retrieve the Functions identity access token".
- The required input fields can be retrieved in a reconnaissance step in test T1619 "Azure - Enumerate Storage Account Objects via Key-based authentication using Azure CLI". The code of function apps may be inspected and prepared from the result of test T1530 "Azure - Dump Azure Storage Account Objects via Azure CLI".

Requirements:
- The test is intended to be executed in interactive mode (with -Interactive parameter) in order to complete the az login command when MFA is required.
- The EntraID user must have the role "Storage Account Contributor", or a role with similar permissions.

```powershell
az login    # Log in to Azure CLI

$allowSharedKeyAccess = az storage account show --name "#{storage_account_name}" --query "allowSharedKeyAccess"

if ($allowSharedKeyAccess -eq "false") {    # $allowSharedKeyAccess could be true or null
    Write-Output "Shared key access is disabled for this storage account."
} else {

    az storage blob download --connection-string $connectionString --container-name "#{container_name}" --name "#{blob_name}" --file $tmpOriginalFunctionCode --overwrite true

    if ($LASTEXITCODE -eq 0) {
        # Upload new blob version if download of existing blob succeeded
        az storage blob upload --connection-string $connectionString --container-name "#{container_name}" --name "#{blob_name}" --file "#{file_path_blob}" --overwrite true
    } else {
        Write-Output "Download original function code failed."
        exit 1
    }
}
```

#### Cleanup Commands:

## Atomic Test #2 - Azure - Functions code upload - Functions code injection via File Share modification to retrieve the Functions identity access token
This test injects code into an Azure Function (RCE) to perform Subscription Privilege Escalation by retrieving the identity access token of an Azure functions instance.

Attack idea/reference: https://orca.security/resources/blog/azure-shared-key-authorization-exploitation/

Once executed, the "https://changeme" will retrieve the access token when the function app is executed on behalf of the tenant. The function may be triggered manually from authorized people, triggered in regular intervals, or in various other ways. The access token can then be used to perform further attack steps with the permissions that the function app holds (e.g. listening virtual machines).

Note: 
- The Azure Function modified in this test must be hosted via Azure Files in a File Share (Info on storage considerations for Azure Function: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/storage-considerations).
- For Function code upload to Azure Functions that are hosted via Azure Blob storage, refer to T1550.001 "Azure - Functions code upload - Functions code injection via Blob upload".
- The required input fields can be retrieved in a reconnaissance step in test T1619 "Azure - Enumerate Storage Account Objects via Key-based authentication using Azure CLI". The code of function apps may be inspected and prepared from the result of test T1530 "Azure - Dump Azure Storage Account Objects via Azure CLI".
- Important: Change the https://changeme.net in code_to_insert_path to a self-controlled endpoint. This endpoint can be hosted e.g. as request bin via Pipedream to display the body of incoming POST requests.
- The default injected code to retrieve the access token can be replaced by arbitrary other code. In this case: Replace the code defined in code_to_insert_path

Requirements:
- The test is intended to be executed in interactive mode (with -Interactive parameter) in order to complete the az login command when MFA is required.
- The EntraID user must have the role "Storage Account Contributor", or a role with similar permissions.

Execution options: Defined by the input field execution_option
- insert_code: This option (1) downloads the existing funciton code into a tmp file, (2) injects the code from code_to_insert_path at the beginning of the file, and (3) uploads the tampered file to the targeted Azure Function code (Azure File Share File).
- replace_file: This option uploads the function code defined in code_to_insert_path to the targeted Azure Function code (Azure File Share File).
