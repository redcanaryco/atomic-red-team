    Uses the [Named Pipes Micro Emulation](https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/adversary_emulation_library/tree/master/micro_emulation_plans/src/named_pipes) executable from the Center for Threat Informed Defense to create a named pipe for inter-process communication.
    
    The named pipe executable will pause for 30 seconds to allow the client and server to exchange a message through the pipe.
