# T1552.003 - Unsecured Credentials: Bash History
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/003)
<blockquote>Adversaries may search the bash command history on compromised systems for insecurely stored credentials. Bash keeps track of the commands users type on the command-line with the "history" utility. Once a user logs out, the history is flushed to the user’s <code>.bash_history</code> file. For each user, this file resides at the same location: <code>~/.bash_history</code>. Typically, this file keeps track of the user’s last 500 commands. Users often type usernames and passwords on the command-line as parameters to programs, which then get saved to this file when they log out. Adversaries can abuse this by looking through the file for potential credentials. (Citation: External to DA, the OS X Way)</blockquote>

**Supported Platforms:** Linux, macOS


**auto_generated_guid:** 3cfde62b-7c33-4b26-a61e-755d6131c8ce





#### Inputs:
| Name | Description | Type | Default Value |
|------|-------------|------|---------------|
| output_file | Path where captured results will be placed | path | ~/loot.txt|
| bash_history_grep_args | grep arguments that filter out specific commands we want to capture | path | -e '-p ' -e 'pass' -e 'ssh'|
| bash_history_filename | Path of the bash history file to capture | path | ~/.bash_history|


#### Attack Commands: Run with `sh`! 


```sh
cat #{bash_history_filename} | grep #{bash_history_grep_args} > #{output_file}
```
