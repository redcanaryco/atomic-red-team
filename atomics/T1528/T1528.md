# T1528 - Steal Application Access Token
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1528)
<blockquote>

Adversaries can steal application access tokens as a means of acquiring credentials to access remote systems and resources.

Application access tokens are used to make authorized API requests on behalf of a user or service and are commonly used as a way to access resources in cloud and container-based applications and software-as-a-service (SaaS).(Citation: Auth0 - Why You Should Always Use Access Tokens to Secure APIs Sept 2019)  Adversaries who steal account API tokens in cloud and containerized environments may be able to access data and perform actions with the permissions of these accounts, which can lead to privilege escalation and further compromise of the environment.

For example, in Kubernetes environments, processes running inside a container may communicate with the Kubernetes API server using service account tokens. If a container is compromised, an adversary may be able to steal the containerâ€™s token and thereby gain access to Kubernetes API commands.(Citation: Kubernetes Service Accounts)  

Similarly, instances within continuous-development / continuous-integration (CI/CD) pipelines will often use API tokens to authenticate to other services for testing and deployment.(Citation: Cider Security Top 10 CICD Security Risks) If these pipelines are compromised, adversaries may be able to steal these tokens and leverage their privileges. 

In Azure, an adversary who compromises a resource with an attached Managed Identity, such as an Azure VM, can request short-lived tokens through the Azure Instance Metadata Service (IMDS). These tokens can then facilitate unauthorized actions or further access to other Azure services, bypassing typical credential-based authentication.(Citation: Entra Managed Identities 2025)(Citation: SpecterOps Managed Identity 2022)

Token theft can also occur through social engineering, in which case user action may be required to grant access. OAuth is one commonly implemented framework that issues tokens to users for access to systems. An application desiring access to cloud-based services or protected APIs can gain entry using OAuth 2.0 through a variety of authorization protocols. An example commonly-used sequence is Microsoft's Authorization Code Grant flow.(Citation: Microsoft Identity Platform Protocols May 2019)(Citation: Microsoft - OAuth Code Authorization flow - June 2019) An OAuth access token enables a third-party application to interact with resources containing user data in the ways requested by the application without obtaining user credentials. 
 
Adversaries can leverage OAuth authorization by constructing a malicious application designed to be granted access to resources with the target user's OAuth token.(Citation: Amnesty OAuth Phishing Attacks, August 2019)(Citation: Trend Micro Pawn Storm OAuth 2017) The adversary will need to complete registration of their application with the authorization server, for example Microsoft Identity Platform using Azure Portal, the Visual Studio IDE, the command-line interface, PowerShell, or REST API calls.(Citation: Microsoft - Azure AD App Registration - May 2019) Then, they can send a [Spearphishing Link](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/002) to the target user to entice them to grant access to the application. Once the OAuth access token is granted, the application can gain potentially long-term access to features of the user account through [Application Access Token](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/001).(Citation: Microsoft - Azure AD Identity Tokens - Aug 2019)

Application access tokens may function within a limited lifetime, limiting how long an adversary can utilize the stolen token. However, in some cases, adversaries can also steal application refresh tokens(Citation: Auth0 Understanding Refresh Tokens), allowing them to obtain new access tokens without prompting the user.

## Atomic Tests

- [Atomic Test #1 - Azure - Functions code upload - Functions code injection via Blob upload](#atomic-test-1---azure---functions-code-upload---functions-code-injection-via-blob-upload)

- [Atomic Test #2 - Azure - Functions code upload - Functions code injection via File Share modification to retrieve the Functions identity access token](#atomic-test-2---azure---functions-code-upload---functions-code-injection-via-file-share-modification-to-retrieve-the-functions-identity-access-token)


<br/>

## Atomic Test #1 - Azure - Functions code upload - Functions code injection via Blob upload
This test injects code into an Azure Function (RCE).

Attack idea/reference: https://orca.security/resources/blog/azure-shared-key-authorization-exploitation/

Similar to T1528 "Azure - Functions code upload - Functions code injection to retrieve the Functions identity access token", the depicted code injection scenario tampers the source code of Azure Functions to perform Subscription Privilege Escalation by retrieving the identity access token of an Azure functions instance. In this case, the prepared zip file (underlying package for a Function) is expected to contain the tampered function presented in src/code_to_insert.py. Note that the endpoint https://changeme.net needs to be adapted in your packed function code.

Note:
- The Azure Function modified in this test must be hosted via Azure Blob storage (Info on storage considerations for Azure Function: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/storage-considerations). 
- For Function code upload to Azure Functions that are hosted via Azure Files in a File Share, refer to T1528 "Azure - Functions code upload - Functions code injection to retrieve the Functions identity access token".
- The required input fields can be retrieved in a reconnaissance step in test T1619 "Azure - Enumerate Storage Account Objects via Key-based authentication using Azure CLI". The code of function apps may be inspected and prepared from the result of test T1530 "Azure - Dump Azure Storage Account Objects via Azure CLI".

Requirements:
- The test is intended to be executed in interactive mode (with -Interactive parameter) in order to complete the az login command when MFA is required.
- The EntraID user must have the role "Storage Account Contributor", or a role with similar permissions.

    $tmpOriginalFunctionCode = Join-Path $env:temp/ ("T1528_tmp_original_" + "#{blob_name}")
    az storage blob download --connection-string $connectionString --container-name "#{container_name}" --name "#{blob_name}" --file $tmpOriginalFunctionCode --overwrite true

    if ($LASTEXITCODE -eq 0) {
        # Upload new blob version if download of existing blob succeeded
        az storage blob upload --connection-string $connectionString --container-name "#{container_name}" --name "#{blob_name}" --file "#{file_path_blob}" --overwrite true
    } else {
        Write-Output "Download original function code failed."
        exit 1
    }
}
```

#### Cleanup Commands:

## Atomic Test #2 - Azure - Functions code upload - Functions code injection via File Share modification to retrieve the Functions identity access token
This test injects code into an Azure Function (RCE) to perform Subscription Privilege Escalation by retrieving the identity access token of an Azure functions instance.

Attack idea/reference: https://orca.security/resources/blog/azure-shared-key-authorization-exploitation/

Once executed, the "https://changeme" will retrieve the access token when the function app is executed on behalf of the tenant. The function may be triggered manually from authorized people, triggered in regular intervals, or in various other ways. The access token can then be used to perform further attack steps with the permissions that the function app holds (e.g. listening virtual machines).

Note: 
- The Azure Function modified in this test must be hosted via Azure Files in a File Share (Info on storage considerations for Azure Function: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/storage-considerations).
- For Function code upload to Azure Functions that are hosted via Azure Blob storage, refer to T1528 "Azure - Functions code upload - Functions code injection via Blob upload".
- The required input fields can be retrieved in a reconnaissance step in test T1619 "Azure - Enumerate Storage Account Objects via Key-based authentication using Azure CLI". The code of function apps may be inspected and prepared from the result of test T1530 "Azure - Dump Azure Storage Account Objects via Azure CLI".
- Important: Change the https://changeme.net in code_to_insert_path to a self-controlled endpoint. This endpoint can be hosted e.g. as request bin via Pipedream to display the body of incoming POST requests.
- The default injected code to retrieve the access token can be replaced by arbitrary other code. In this case: Replace the code defined in code_to_insert_path

Requirements:
- The test is intended to be executed in interactive mode (with -Interactive parameter) in order to complete the az login command when MFA is required.
- The EntraID user must have the role "Storage Account Contributor", or a role with similar permissions.

Execution options: Defined by the input field execution_option
- insert_code: This option (1) downloads the existing funciton code into a tmp file, (2) injects the code from code_to_insert_path at the beginning of the file, and (3) uploads the tampered file to the targeted Azure Function code (Azure File Share File).
- replace_file: This option uploads the function code defined in code_to_insert_path to the targeted Azure Function code (Azure File Share File).
