# T1552.007 - Kubernetes List Secrets
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/007)
<blockquote>Adversaries may gather credentials via APIs within a containers environment. APIs in these environments, such as the Docker API and Kubernetes APIs, allow a user to remotely manage their container resources and cluster components.(Citation: Docker API)(Citation: Kubernetes API)

An adversary may access the Docker API to collect logs that contain credentials to cloud, container, and various other resources in the environment.(Citation: Unit 42 Unsecured Docker Daemons) An adversary with sufficient permissions, such as via a pod's service account, may also use the Kubernetes API to retrieve credentials from the Kubernetes API server. These credentials may include those needed for Docker API authentication or secrets from Kubernetes cluster components. </blockquote>

## Atomic Tests

- [Atomic Test #1 - List All Secrets](#atomic-test-1---list-all-secrets)

- [Atomic Test #2 - ListSecrets](#atomic-test-2---listsecrets)

- [Atomic Test #3 - Cat the contents of a Kubernetes service account token file](#atomic-test-3---cat-the-contents-of-a-kubernetes-service-account-token-file)


<br/>

## Atomic Test #1 - List All Secrets
A Kubernetes secret is an object that lets users store and manage sensitive information, such as passwords and connection strings in the cluster. Secrets can be consumed by reference in the pod configuration. Attackers who have permissions to retrieve the secrets from the API server (by using the pod service account, for example) can access sensitive information that might include credentials to various services or provide further access to the cluster.
[More information about secrets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/).

This test will make a request to the Kubernetes api at the `/api/v1/secrets` endpoint requesting every secret stored within the cluster.
