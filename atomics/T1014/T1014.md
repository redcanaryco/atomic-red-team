# T1014 - Rootkit
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1014)
<blockquote>Rootkits are programs that hide the existence of malware by intercepting (i.e., Hooking) and modifying operating system API calls that supply system information. (Citation: Symantec Windows Rootkits) Rootkits or rootkit enabling functionality may reside at the user or kernel level in the operating system or lower, to include a Hypervisor, Master Boot Record, or the System Firmware. (Citation: Wikipedia Rootkit)

Adversaries may use rootkits to hide the presence of programs, files, network connections, services, drivers, and other system components. Rootkits have been seen for Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X systems. (Citation: CrowdStrike Linux Rootkit) (Citation: BlackHat Mac OSX Rootkit)

Detection: Some rootkit protections may be built into anti-virus or operating system software. There are dedicated rootkit detection tools that look for specific types of rootkit behavior. Monitor for the existence of unrecognized DLLs, devices, services, and changes to the MBR. (Citation: Wikipedia Rootkit)

Platforms: Linux, macOS, Windows

Data Sources: BIOS, MBR, System calls

Defense Bypassed: Anti-virus, File monitoring, Host intrusion prevention systems, Process whitelisting, Signature-based detection, System access controls, Whitelisting by file name or path

Permissions Required: Administrator, SYSTEM, root</blockquote>

## Atomic Test #1 - Loadable Kernel Module based Rootkit
Loadable Kernel Module based Rootkit

**Supported Platforms:** Linux


#### Inputs
| Name | Description | Type | Default Value | 
|------|-------------|------|---------------|
| rootkit_file | Path To Module | String | Module.ko|

#### Run it with `sh`!
```
sudo insmod #{rootkit_file}
```
<br/>
<br/>

## Atomic Test #2 - Loadable Kernel Module based Rootkit
Loadable Kernel Module based Rootkit

**Supported Platforms:** Linux


#### Inputs
| Name | Description | Type | Default Value | 
|------|-------------|------|---------------|
| rootkit_file | Path To Module | String | Module.ko|

#### Run it with `sh`!
```
sudo modprobe #{rootkit_file}
```
<br/>
<br/>

## Atomic Test #3 - LD_PRELOAD based Rootkit
LD_PRELOAD based Rootkit

**Supported Platforms:** Linux


#### Run it with `sh`!
```
export LD_PRELOAD=$PWD/#{rootkit_file}
```
<br/>
<br/>

## Atomic Test #4 - Windows Signed Driver Rootkit Test
This test exploits a signed driver to execute code in Kernel.
SHA1 C1D5CF8C43E7679B782630E93F5E6420CA1749A7
We leverage the work done here:
https://zerosum0x0.blogspot.com/2017/07/puppet-strings-dirty-secret-for-free.html
The hash of our PoC Exploit is
SHA1 DD8DA630C00953B6D5182AA66AF999B1E117F441
This will simulate hiding a process.
It would be wise if you only run this in a test environment

**Supported Platforms:** Windows


#### Inputs
| Name | Description | Type | Default Value | 
|------|-------------|------|---------------|
| driver_path | Path to the vulnerable driver | Path | C:\Drivers\driver.sys|

#### Run it with `command_prompt`!
```
puppetstrings #{driver_path}
```
