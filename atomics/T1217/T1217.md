# T1217 - Browser Bookmark Discovery
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1217)
<blockquote>Adversaries may enumerate browser bookmarks to learn more about compromised hosts. Browser bookmarks may reveal personal information about users (ex: banking sites, interests, social media, etc.) as well as details about internal network resources such as servers, tools/dashboards, or other related infrastructure.

Browser bookmarks may also highlight additional targets after an adversary has access to valid credentials, especially Credentials in Files associated with logins cached by a browser.

Specific storage locations vary based on platform and/or application, but browser bookmarks are typically stored in local files/databases.

Detection: Monitor processes and command-line arguments for actions that could be taken to gather browser bookmark information. Remote access tools with built-in features may interact directly using APIs to gather information. Information may also be acquired through system management tools such as Windows Management Instrumentation and PowerShell.

System and network discovery techniques normally occur throughout an operation as an adversary learns the environment. Data and events should not be viewed in isolation, but as part of a chain of behavior that could lead to other activities, such as Collection and Exfiltration, based on the information obtained.

Platforms: Linux, Windows, macOS

Data Sources: API monitoring, File monitoring, Process command-line parameters, Process Monitoring

Permissions Required: User

<br/>

## Atomic Test #1 - List Mozilla Firefox Bookmark Database Files on Linux
Searches for Mozilla Firefox's places.sqlite file (on Linux distributions) that contains bookmarks and lists any found instances to a text file.

**Supported Platforms:** Linux


#### Run it with `sh`!
```
find / -path "*.mozilla/firefox/*/places.sqlite" -exec echo {} >> /tmp/firefox-bookmarks.txt \;
```
<br/>
<br/>

## Atomic Test #2 - List Mozilla Firefox Bookmark Database Files on macOS
Searches for Mozilla Firefox's places.sqlite file (on macOS) that contains bookmarks and lists any found instances to a text file.

**Supported Platforms:** macOS


#### Run it with `sh`!
```
find / -path "*/Firefox/Profiles/*/places.sqlite" -exec echo {} >> /tmp/firefox-bookmarks.txt \;
```
