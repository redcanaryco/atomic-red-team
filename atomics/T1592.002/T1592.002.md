# T1592.002 - Software
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1592/002)
<blockquote>Adversaries may gather information about the victim's host software that can be used during targeting. Information about installed software may include a variety of details such as types and versions on specific hosts, as well as the presence of additional components that might be indicative of added defensive protections (ex: antivirus, SIEMs, etc.).

Adversaries may gather this information in various ways, such as direct collection actions via [Active Scanning](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1595) (ex: listening ports, server banners, user agent strings) or [Phishing for Information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1598). Adversaries may also compromise sites then include malicious content designed to collect host information from visitors.(Citation: ATT ScanBox) Information about the installed software may also be exposed to adversaries via online or other accessible data sets (ex: job postings, network maps, assessment reports, resumes, or purchase invoices). Gathering this information may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex: [Search Open Websites/Domains](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1593) or [Search Open Technical Databases](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1596)), establishing operational resources (ex: [Develop Capabilities](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1587) or [Obtain Capabilities](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1588)), and/or for initial access (ex: [Supply Chain Compromise](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1195) or [External Remote Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1133)).</blockquote>

## Atomic Tests

- [Atomic Test #1 - Enumerate COM Objects with Powershell](#atomic-test-1---enumerate-com-objects-with-powershell)


<br/>

## Atomic Test #1 - Enumerate COM Objects with Powershell
This test is designed to enumerate the COM objects listed in HKCR, then output their methods and CLSIDs to a text file.
An adversary could then use this information to identify COM objects that might be vulnerable to abuse, such as using them to spawn arbitrary processes.

**Supported Platforms:** Windows


**auto_generated_guid:** 0d80d088-a84c-4353-af1a-fc8b439f1564





#### Inputs:
| Name | Description | Type | Default Value |
|------|-------------|------|---------------|
| output_file | File to output list of COM objects to | String | $env:temp&#92;T1592.002Test1.txt|


#### Attack Commands: Run with `powershell`! 


```powershell
New-PSDrive -PSProvider registry -Root HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT -Name HKCR
Get-ChildItem -Path HKCR:\CLSID -Name | Select -Skip 1 > $env:temp\clsids.txt
ForEach($CLSID in Get-Content "$env:temp\clsids.txt")
{try{write-output "$($Position)-$($CLSID)"
write-output "------------"| out-file #{output_file} -append
write-output $($CLSID)| out-file #{output_file} -append
$handle=[activator]::CreateInstance([type]::GetTypeFromCLSID($CLSID))
$handle | get-member -erroraction silentlycontinue | out-file #{output_file} -append
$position += 1} catch{}}
```

#### Cleanup Commands:
```powershell
remove-item #{output_file} -force -erroraction silentlycontinue
remove-item $env:temp\clsids.txt -force -erroraction silentlycontinue
```
