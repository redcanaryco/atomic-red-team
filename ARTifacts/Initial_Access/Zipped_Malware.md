# Zipped Malware

A common method actors use to deliver is through zip attachments in email.

## ZIP + VBS Example

Take the following [qbot chain reaction](https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/blob/master/ARTifacts/Chain_Reactions/qbot_infection_reaction.vbs) and compress (zip) the vbs file to be used for delivery.

Simulate other file types by zipping and deliver to the receiving device.
