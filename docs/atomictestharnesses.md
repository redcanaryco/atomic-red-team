# AtomicTestHarnesses

AtomicTestHarnesses is a PowerShell module that simulates multiple variations
on a single attack technique.

## Complexity simplified

The exact details of a technique can vary from attack to attack.
With AtomicTestHarnesses, you can test for multiple versions of an attack at
once.

## Validated testing

AtomicTestHarnesses includes a suite of Pester tests to help you validate your
telemetry, so you can stop worrying and get back to testing.
