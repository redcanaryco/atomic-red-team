# Purpose
This document serves as a reference for the Atomic Red Team maintainers. It is used to capture administrative processes, lessons, and others reference useful to those who join the maintainers team in the future. 

# Project Management 
Issues should be used to track all proposed or planned changes to Atomic Red Team. 

Milestones should be used to track all major features or changes, most of which will require that we define and complete multiple issues.

Any breaking change or major feature should be communicated to the community via Slack, using the following process:

1. Announce the issue or milestone in #general (TODO: Should we create #announcements for this purpose?)
2. Follow up on the original announcement with a link to any public branch that can be reviewed for comment.
3. Once comments and questions have been resolved, announce that the issue will be merged on $date.
    * For major features, a day's notice is sufficient. 
    * For breaking changes, 14-30 days notice is ideal. This will require some context (i.e., maintainer's knowledge of how much will break and how badly)
