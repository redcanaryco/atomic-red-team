# Chain Reactor

Chain Reactor is a tool for testing detection and response coverage on Linux
machines.

## Portable testing for Linux

Chain Reactor creates executables that can perform sequences of
actions like process creation and network connection. Compile your tests once
and run them on as many machines as you need!

## Customizable test files

Customizing your tests is as easy as editing a JSON file. Specify a list of
behaviors and let Chain Reactor do the heavy lifting.

## Download Chain Reactor

You can download Chain Reactor directly from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/redcanaryco/chain-reactor).

[Getting started](https://github.com/redcanaryco/chain-reactor/wiki/Getting-started.md)
