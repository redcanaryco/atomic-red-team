# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

Welcome to the [Atomic Red Team online community](https://atomicredteam.io/). Our goal is to foster an open, safe, and welcoming environment. As a collective, we—as contributors, maintainers, and the Open Source Projects team of Red Canary—pledge to encourage our project and community to be a harassment-free space. We invite you to collaborate, exchange thoughts or information, and engage with one another. Atomic Red Team is meant for everyone, regardless of age, personal appearance, body size, disability, nationality, race, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience or academics, religion, or sexual identity and orientation. 

## Our Guidelines

* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community and what supports engagement
* Showing compassion and understanding towards other community members

## Reporting

If you see anything that you believe breaks our community guidelines, no matter if it’s privately or publicly witnessed, please reach out to the **Atomic Red Team Community Manager – Marrelle Bailey** via Slack direct message or [email](mailto:opensource@redcanary.com) with screenshots of the post/text and a link to the post or comments. 

## Enforcement & Consequences

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the Community Manager. Unacceptable behavior will not be tolerated by community members, maintainers, and Red Canary team members.  The Atomic Red Team Community Manager and maintainers will review and investigate all complaints. 

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately. If an Atomic Red Team community member (anyone contributing to our [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team) or [Community Slack](https://slack.atomicredteam.io/)) engages in unacceptable behavior, the Community Manager may take any temporary or permanent action they deem appropriate, up to and including immediate expulsion from the Atomic Red Team community without warning.

Atomic Red Team maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.

## Manager’s & Maintainers’ Responsibilities

Atomic Red Team Community Managers are responsible for upholding the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Atomic Red Team Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or that they otherwise deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all of the Atomic Red Team, and “Atomic Family,” project spaces, including public spaces where an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing the project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.
